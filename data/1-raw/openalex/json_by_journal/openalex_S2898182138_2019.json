    "ab": "BackgroundRoad injuries are among the ten leading causes of death worldwide and also impede economic wellbeing and macroeconomic performance. Beyond medical data on the incidence of road injuries and their resulting morbidity and mortality, a detailed understanding of their economic implications is a prerequisite for sound, evidence-based policy making. We aimed to determine global macroeconomic costs of road traffic injuries and their cross-country distribution.MethodsWe calculated the economic burden of all road traffic-related injuries for 166 countries by use of a macroeconomic model that accounts for the effect of fatal and non-fatal injuries on labour supply, age-specific differences in education and experience of those who are affected by road accidents, and the diversion of injury-related treatment expenses from savings, which results in lower investment.FindingsWe estimated that road injuries will cost the world economy US$1·8 trillion (constant 2010 US$) in 2015–30, which is equivalent to an annual tax of 0·12% on global gross domestic product. Although low-income and middle-income countries have the largest health burden, their share of the economic burden of road injuries is only 46·4% of the global loss, reflecting in part higher productivity (and earnings) in high-income countries, but also prominently higher treatment costs. Our results also indicate that treatment costs account for a greater proportion of the economic burden in high-income countries than in low-income countries.InterpretationThe macroeconomic burden of road injuries is sizeable and distributed unequally across countries and world regions. This finding suggests a case for nuanced policy making. Our framework should provide a good starting point for the more detailed analysis of policies both at country level and across different countries.FundingNational Institute on Aging.",

    "ab": "BackgroundGreen spaces have been proposed to be a health determinant, improving health and wellbeing through different mechanisms. We aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence from longitudinal studies that have investigated green spaces and their association with all-cause mortality. We aimed to evaluate this evidence with a meta-analysis, to determine exposure-response functions for future quantitative health impact assessments.MethodsWe did a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies on green spaces and all-cause mortality. We searched for studies published and indexed in MEDLINE before Aug 20, 2019, which we complemented with an additional search of cited literature. We included studies if their design was longitudinal; the exposure of interest was measured green space; the endpoint of interest was all-cause mortality; they provided a risk estimate (ie, a hazard ratio [HR]) and the corresponding 95% CI for the association between green space exposure and all-cause mortality; and they used normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as their green space exposure definition. Two investigators (DR-R and DP-L) independently screened the full-text articles for inclusion. We used a random-effects model to obtain pooled HRs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018090315.FindingsWe identified 9298 studies in MEDLINE and 13 studies that were reported in the literature but not indexed in MEDLINE, of which 9234 (99%) studies were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts and 68 (88%) of 77 remaining studies were excluded after assessment of the full texts. We included nine (12%) studies in our quantitative evaluation, which comprised 8 324 652 individuals from seven countries. Seven (78%) of the nine studies found a significant inverse relationship between an increase in surrounding greenness per 0·1 NDVI in a buffer zone of 500 m or less and the risk of all-cause mortality, but two studies found no association. The pooled HR for all-cause mortality per increment of 0·1 NDVI within a buffer of 500 m or less of a participant's residence was 0·96 (95% CI 0·94–0·97; I2, 95%).InterpretationWe found evidence of an inverse association between surrounding greenness and all-cause mortality. Interventions to increase and manage green spaces should therefore be considered as a strategic public health intervention.FundingWorld Health Organization.",

    "ab": "BackgroundPaediatric asthma incidence is associated with exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), but the TRAP-attributable burden remains poorly quantified. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a major component and common proxy of TRAP. In this study, we estimated the annual global number of new paediatric asthma cases attributable to NO2 exposure at a resolution sufficient to resolve intra-urban exposure gradients.MethodsWe obtained 2015 country-specific and age-group-specific asthma incidence rates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation for 194 countries and 2015 population counts at a spatial resolution of 250 × 250 m from the Global Human Settlement population grid. We used 2010–12 annual average surface NO2 concentrations derived from land-use regression at a resolution of 100 × 100 m, and we derived concentration-response functions from relative risk estimates reported in a multinational meta-analysis. We then estimated the NO2-attributable burden of asthma incidence in children aged 1–18 years in 194 countries and 125 major cities at a resolution of 250 × 250 m.FindingsGlobally, we estimated that 4·0 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1·8–5·2) new paediatric asthma cases could be attributable to NO2 pollution annually; 64% of these occur in urban centres. This burden accounts for 13% (6–16) of global incidence. Regionally, the greatest burdens of new asthma cases associated with NO2 exposure per 100 000 children were estimated for Andean Latin America (340 cases per year, 95% UI 150–440), high-income North America (310, 140–400), and high-income Asia Pacific (300, 140–370). Within cities, the greatest burdens of new asthma cases associated with NO2 exposure per 100 000 children were estimated for Lima, Peru (690 cases per year, 95% UI 330–870); Shanghai, China (650, 340–770); and Bogota, Colombia (580, 270–730). Among 125 major cities, the percentage of new asthma cases attributable to NO2 pollution ranged from 5·6% (95% UI 2·4–7·4) in Orlu, Nigeria, to 48% (25–57) in Shanghai, China. This contribution exceeded 20% of new asthma cases in 92 cities. We estimated that about 92% of paediatric asthma incidence attributable to NO2 exposure occurred in areas with annual average NO2 concentrations lower than the WHO guideline of 21 parts per billion.InterpretationEfforts to reduce NO2 exposure could help prevent a substantial portion of new paediatric asthma cases in both developed and developing countries, and especially in urban areas. Traffic emissions should be a target for exposure-mitigation strategies. The adequacy of the WHO guideline for ambient NO2 concentrations might need to be revisited.FundingGeorge Washington University.",

    "ab": "In many countries, doctors are recommended to provide nutrition care to patients to improve the dietary behaviours of individuals and populations. Here, we present a systematic review that aims to critically synthesise literature on nutrition education provided to medical students.In this systematic review, a literature search was done between May 1 and July 1, 2018, for articles on medical students' nutrition knowledge, skills, and confidence to counsel patients, from Nov 1, 2012, to Dec 31, 2018. Search terms related to medical students included \"nutrition in medical education\", \"medical nutrition education\", and \"undergraduate medical nutrition education\". Search terms for topic of interest included \"nutrition\", \"knowledge\", \"skills\", \"nutrition counselling\", \"confidence\", \"nutrition care\", or \"nutrition education\". Included studies examined any aspect of recently graduated (ie, ≤4 years) or current medical students' nutrition knowledge, attitudes, skills, or confidence (or all three) in nutrition or nutrition counselling; evaluated nutrition curriculum initiatives for medical students; or assessed recently graduated or current medical students' perceptions of nutrition education. Quality assessment appraisal of the studies was done using a Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Curriculum initiatives were also appraised.66 studies were identified by the search and 24 were eligible for full-text analysis. 16 quantitative studies, three qualitative studies, and five curriculum initiatives from the USA (n=11), Europe (n=4), the Middle East (n=1), Africa (n=1), and Australasia (n=7) met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis of these studies showed that nutrition is insufficiently incorporated into medical education, regardless of country, setting, or year of medical education. Deficits in nutrition education affect students' knowledge, skills, and confidence to implement nutrition care into patient care. A modest positive effect was reported from curriculum initiatives.Despite the centrality of nutrition to healthy lifestyle, medical students are not supported to provide high-quality, effective nutrition care. Medical education can be enhanced by institutional commitment to make nutrition education compulsory in medical training, establishment of nutrition competencies to provide a benchmark for nutrition knowledge and skills to be included in curricula, and supported by funding for innovative curriculum initiatives. These initiatives will improve nutrition in medical training to support future doctors for the 21st century.Sir John Logan Campbell Medical Fellowship 2017, and an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Fellowship.",

    "ab": "BackgroundOngoing climate change might, through rising temperatures, alter allergenic pollen biology across the northern hemisphere. We aimed to analyse trends in pollen seasonality and pollen load and to establish whether there are specific climate-related links to any observed changes.MethodsFor this retrospective data analysis, we did an extensive search for global datasets with 20 years or more of airborne pollen data that consistently recorded pollen season indices (eg, duration and intensity). 17 locations across three continents with long-term (approximately 26 years on average) quantitative records of seasonal concentrations of multiple pollen (aeroallergen) taxa met the selection criteria. These datasets were analysed in the context of recent annual changes in maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) associated with anthropogenic climate change. Seasonal regressions (slopes) of variation in pollen load and pollen season duration over time were compared to Tmax, cumulative degree day Tmax, Tmin, cumulative degree day Tmin, and frost-free days among all 17 locations to ascertain significant correlations.Findings12 (71%) of the 17 locations showed significant increases in seasonal cumulative pollen or annual pollen load. Similarly, 11 (65%) of the 17 locations showed a significant increase in pollen season duration over time, increasing, on average, 0·9 days per year. Across the northern hemisphere locations analysed, annual cumulative increases in Tmax over time were significantly associated with percentage increases in seasonal pollen load (r=0·52, p=0·034) as were annual cumulative increases in Tmin (r=0·61, p=0·010). Similar results were observed for pollen season duration, but only for cumulative degree days (higher than the freezing point [0°C or 32°F]) for Tmax (r=0·53, p=0·030) and Tmin (r=0·48, p=0·05). Additionally, temporal increases in frost-free days per year were significantly correlated with increases in both pollen load (r=0·62, p=0·008) and pollen season duration (r=0·68, p=0·003) when averaged for all 17 locations.InterpretationOur findings reveal that the ongoing increase in temperature extremes (Tmin and Tmax) might already be contributing to extended seasonal duration and increased pollen load for multiple aeroallergenic pollen taxa in diverse locations across the northern hemisphere. This study, done across multiple continents, highlights an important link between ongoing global warming and public health—one that could be exacerbated as temperatures continue to increase.FundingNone.",

ESBL-EC and pAmpC-EC are increasingly reported in animals, food, the environment, and community-acquired and health-care-associated human infections. These infections are usually preceded by asymptomatic carriage, for which attributions to animal, food, environmental, and human sources remain unquantified.MethodsIn this population-based modelling study, we collected ESBL and pAmpC gene data on the Netherlands population for 2005–17 from published datasets of gene occurrences in E coli isolates from different sources, and from partners of the ESBL Attribution Consortium and the Dutch National Antimicrobial Surveillance System. Using these data, we applied an established source attribution model based on ESBL-EC and pAmpC-EC prevalence and gene data for humans, including high-risk populations (ie, returning travellers, clinical patients, farmers), farm and companion animals, food, surface freshwater, and wild birds, and human exposure data, to quantify the overall and gene-specific attributable sources of community-acquired ESBL-EC and pAmpC-EC intestinal carriage. We also used a simple transmission model to determine the basic reproduction number (R0) in the open community.FindingsWe identified 1220 occurrences of ESBL-EC and pAmpC-EC genes in humans, of which 478 were in clinical patients, 454 were from asymptomatic carriers in the open community, 103 were in poultry and pig farmers, and 185 were in people who had travelled out of the region. We also identified 6275 occurrences in non-human sources, including 479 in companion animals, 4026 in farm animals, 66 in wild birds, 1430 from food products, and 274 from surface freshwater. Most community-acquired ESBL-EC and pAmpC-EC carriage was attributed to human-to-human transmission within or between households in the open community (60·1%, 95% credible interval 40·0–73·5), and to secondary transmission from high-risk groups (6·9%, 4·1–9·2). Food accounted for 18·9% (7·0–38·3) of carriage, companion animals for 7·9% (1·4–19·9), farm animals (non-occupational contact) for 3·6% (0·6–9·9), and swimming in freshwater and wild birds (ie, environmental contact) for 2·6% (0·2–8·7). We derived an R0 of 0·63 (95% CI 0·42–0·77) for intracommunity transmission.InterpretationAlthough humans are the main source of community-acquired ESBL-EC and pAmpC-EC carriage, the attributable non-human sources underpin the need for longitudinal studies and continuous monitoring, because intracommunity ESBL-EC and pAmpC-EC spread alone is unlikely to be self-maintaining without transmission to and from non-human sources.Funding1Health4Food, Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the EU's Horizon-2020 through One-Health European Joint Programme.",

    "ab": "BackgroundClimate change driven by human activities has increased annual temperatures in Spain by around 1°C since 1980. However, little is known regarding the extent to which the association between temperature and mortality has changed among the most susceptible population groups as a result of the rapidly warming climate. We aimed to assess trends in temperature-related cardiovascular disease mortality in Spain by sex and age, and we investigated the association between climate warming and changes in the risk of mortality.MethodsWe did a country-wide time-series analysis of 48 provinces in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2016. We extracted daily cardiovascular disease mortality data disaggregated by sex, age, and province from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics database. We also extracted daily mean temperatures from the European Climate Assessment and Dataset project. We applied a quasi-Poisson regression model for each province, controlling for seasonal and long-term trends, to estimate the temporal changes in the province-specific temperature-mortality associations with distributed lag non-linear models. We did a multivariate random-effects meta-analysis to derive the best linear unbiased prediction of the temperature–mortality association and the minimum mortality temperature in each province. Heat-attributable and cold-attributable fractions of death were computed by separating the contributions from days with temperatures warmer and colder than the minimum mortality temperature, respectively.FindingsBetween 1980 and 2016, 4 576 600 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. For warm temperatures, the increase in relative risk (RR) of death from cardiovascular diseases was higher for women than men and higher for older individuals (aged ≥90 years) than younger individuals (aged 60–74 years), whereas for cold temperatures, RRs were higher for men than women, with no clear pattern by age group. The heat-attributable fraction of cardiovascular deaths was higher for women in all age groups, and the cold-attributable fraction was larger in men. The heat-attributable fraction increased with age for both sexes, whereas the cold-attributable fraction increased with age for men and decreased for women. Overall minimum mortality temperature increased from 19·5°C between 1980 and 1994 to 20·2°C between 2002 and 2016, which is similar in magnitude to, and occurred in parallel with, the observed mean increase of 0·77°C that occurred in Spain between these two time periods. In general, between 1980 and 2016, the risk and attributable fraction of cardiovascular deaths due to warm and cold temperatures decreased for men and women across all age groups. For all the age groups combined, between 1980–94 and 2002–16, the heat-attributable fraction decreased by −42·06% (95% empirical CI −44·39 to −41·06) for men and −36·64% (−36·70 to −36·04) for women, whereas the cold-attributable fraction was reduced by −30·23% (−30·34 to −30·05) for men and −44·87% (−46·77 to −42·94) for women.InterpretationIn Spain, the observed warming of the climate has occurred in parallel with substantial adaptation to both high and low temperatures. The reduction in the RR and the attributable fraction associated with heat would be compatible with an adaptive response specifically addressing the negative consequences of climate change. Nevertheless, the simultaneous reduction in the RR and attributable fraction of cold temperatures also highlights the importance of more general factors such as socioeconomic development, increased life expectancy and quality, and improved health-care services in the country.FundingNone.",

    "ab": "BackgroundExposure to natural vegetation, or greenness, might affect health through several pathways, including increased physical activity and social engagement, improved mental health, and reductions in exposure to air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Few studies of the effects of greenness have focused on Asia, and, to the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed the effect on vulnerable oldest-old populations. We assessed the association between residential greenness and mortality in an older cohort in China.MethodsWe used five waves (February, 2000–October, 2014) of the China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), a prospective cohort representative of the general older population in China. We assessed exposure to greenness through satellite-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values in the 250 m and 1250 m radius around the residential address for each individual included in the study. We calculated contemporaneous NDVI values, cumulative NDVI values, and changes in NDVI from the start of the study over time. The health outcome of the study was all-cause mortality, excluding accidental deaths. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, geographical region, childhood and adult socioeconomic status, social and leisure activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity.FindingsAmong 23 754 individuals (mean age at baseline 93 years [SD 7·5]) totaling 80 001 person-years, we observed 18 948 deaths during 14 years of follow-up, between June, 2000, and December, 2014. Individuals in the highest quartile of contemporaneous NDVI values had 27% lower mortality than those in the lowest quartile for the 250 m radius (hazard ratio [HR] 0·73, 95% CI 0·70–0·76), and 30% lower mortality for the 1250 m radius (0·70, 0·67–0·74). No clear association was observed for cumulative NDVI measurements and mortality. We did not detect an association between area-level changes in NDVI and mortality.InterpretationOur research suggests that proximity to more green space is associated with increased longevity, which has policy implications for the national blueprint of ecological civilisation and preparation for an ageing society in China.FundingBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, US National Institute on Aging, US National Institute of Health, Natural Science Foundation of China, UN Population Fund, China Social Sciences Foundation, and Hong Kong Research Grants Council.",

    "ab": "BackgroundIncreasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) affect global nutrition via effects on agricultural productivity and nutrient content of food crops. We combined these effects with economic projections to estimate net changes in nutrient availability between 2010 and 2050.MethodsIn this modelling study, we used the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade to project per capita availability of protein, iron, and zinc in 2050. We used estimated changes in productivity of individual agricultural commodities to model effects on production, trade, prices, and consumption under moderate and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Two independent sources of data, which used different methodologies to determine the effect of increased atmospheric CO2 on different key crops, were combined with the modelled food supply results to estimate future nutrient availability.FindingsAlthough technological change, market responses, and the effects of CO2 fertilisation on yield are projected to increase global availability of dietary protein, iron, and zinc, these increases are moderated by negative effects of climate change affecting productivity and carbon penalties on nutrient content. The carbon nutrient penalty results in decreases in the global availability of dietary protein of 4·1%, iron of 2·8%, and zinc of 2·5% as calculated using one dataset, and decreases in global availability of dietary protein of 2·9%, iron of 3·6%, and zinc of 3·4% using the other dataset. The combined effects of projected increases in atmospheric CO2 (ie, carbon nutrient penalty, CO2 fertilisation, and climate effects on productivity) will decrease growth in the global availability of nutrients by 19·5% for protein, 13·6% for iron, and 14·6% for zinc relative to expected technology and market gains by 2050. The many countries that currently have high levels of nutrient deficiency would continue to be disproportionately affected.InterpretationThis approach is an improvement in estimating future global food security by simultaneously projecting climate change effects on crop productivity and changes in nutrient content under increased concentrations of CO2, which accounts for a much larger effect on nutrient availability than CO2 fertilisation. Regardless of the scenario used to project future consumption patterns, the net effect of increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 will slow progress in decreasing global nutrient deficiencies.FundingUS Environmental Protection Agency, Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CIGAR) Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets (PIM), and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change and Food Security (CCAFS).",

    "ab": "BackgroundSeveral single-exposure studies have documented possible effects of environmental factors on lung function, but none has relied on an exposome approach. We aimed to evaluate the association between a broad range of prenatal and postnatal lifestyle and environmental exposures and lung function in children.MethodsIn this analysis, we used data from 1033 mother–child pairs from the European Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) cohort (consisting of six existing longitudinal birth cohorts in France, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, and the UK of children born between 2003 and 2009) for whom a valid spirometry test was recorded for the child. 85 prenatal and 125 postnatal exposures relating to outdoor, indoor, chemical, and lifestyle factors were assessed, and lung function was measured by spirometry in children at age 6–12 years. Two agnostic linear regression methods, a deletion-substitution-addition (DSA) algorithm considering all exposures simultaneously, and an exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) considering exposures independently, were applied to test the association with forced expiratory volume in 1 s percent predicted values (FEV1%). We tested for two-way interaction between exposures and corrected for confounding by co-exposures.FindingsIn the 1033 children (median age 8·1 years, IQR 6·5–9·0), mean FEV1% was 98·8% (SD 13·2). In the ExWAS, prenatal perfluorononanoate (p=0·034) and perfluorooctanoate (p=0·030) exposures were associated with lower FEV1%, and inverse distance to nearest road during pregnancy (p=0·030) was associated with higher FEV1%. Nine postnatal exposures were associated with lower FEV1%: copper (p=0·041), ethyl-paraben (p=0·029), five phthalate metabolites (mono-2-ethyl 5-carboxypentyl phthalate [p=0·016], mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate [p=0·023], mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate [p=0·0085], mono-4-methyl-7-oxooctyl phthalate [p=0·040], and the sum of di-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites [p=0·014]), house crowding (p=0·015), and facility density around schools (p=0·027). However, no exposure passed the significance threshold when corrected for multiple testing in ExWAS, and none was selected with the DSA algorithm, including when testing for exposure interactions.InterpretationOur systematic exposome approach identified several environmental exposures, mainly chemicals, that might be associated with lung function. Reducing exposure to these ubiquitous chemicals could help to prevent the development of chronic respiratory disease.FundingEuropean Community's Seventh Framework Programme (HELIX project).",

    "ab": "BackgroundAir pollution in Beijing has been improving through implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (2013–17), but its implications for respiratory morbidity have not been directly investigated. We aimed to assess the potential effects of air-quality improvements on respiratory health by investigating the number of cases of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) advanced by air pollution each year.MethodsDaily city-wide concentrations of PM10, PM2·5, PMcoarse (particulate matter >2·5–10 μm diameter), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) in 2013–17 were averaged from 35 monitoring stations across Beijing. A generalised additive Poisson time-series model was applied to estimate the relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for hospitalisation for acute exacerbation of COPD associated with pollutant concentrations.FindingsFrom Jan 18, 2013, to Dec 31, 2017, 161 613 hospitalisations for acute exacerbation of COPD were recorded. Mean ambient concentrations of SO2 decreased by 68% and PM2·5 decreased by 33% over this 5-year period. For each IQR increase in pollutant concentration, RRs for same-day hospitalisation for acute exacerbation of COPD were 1·029 (95% CI 1·023–1·035) for PM10, 1·028 (1·021–1·034) for PM2·5, 1·018 (1·013–1·022) for PMcoarse, 1·036 (1·028–1·044) for NO2, 1·019 (1·013–1·024) for SO2, 1·024 (1·018–1·029) for CO, and 1·027 (1·010–1·044) for O3 in the warm season (May to October). Women and patients aged 65 years or older were more susceptible to the effects of these pollutants on hospitalisation risk than were men and patients younger than 65 years. In 2013, there were 12 679 acute exacerbations of COPD cases that were advanced by PM2·5 pollution above the expected number of cases if daily PM2·5 concentrations had not exceeded the WHO target (25 μg/m3), whereas the respective figure in 2017 was 7377 cases.InterpretationDespite improvement in overall air quality, increased acute air pollution episodes were significantly associated with increased hospitalisations for acute exacerbations of COPD in Beijing. Stringent air pollution control policies are important and effective for reducing COPD morbidity, and long-term multidimensional policies to safeguard public health are indicated.FundingUK Medical Research Council.",

    "ab": "BackgroundLatin America is one of the most unequal regions in the world, but evidence is lacking on the magnitude of health inequalities in urban areas of the region. Our objective was to examine inequalities in life expectancy in six large Latin American cities and its association with a measure of area-level socioeconomic status.MethodsIn this ecological analysis, we used data from the Salud Urbana en America Latina (SALURBAL) study on six large cities in Latin America (Buenos Aires, Argentina; Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; San José, Costa Rica; Mexico City, Mexico; and Panama City, Panama), comprising 266 subcity units, for the period 2011–15 (expect for Panama city, which was for 2012–16). We calculated average life expectancy at birth by sex and subcity unit with life tables using age-specific mortality rates estimated from a Bayesian model, and calculated the difference between the ninth and first decile of life expectancy at birth (P90–P10 gap) across subcity units in cities. We also analysed the association between life expectancy at birth and socioeconomic status at the subcity-unit level, using education as a proxy for socioeconomic status, and whether any geographical patterns existed in cities between subcity units.FindingsWe found large spatial differences in average life expectancy at birth in Latin American cities, with the largest P90–P10 gaps observed in Panama City (9·8 years for men and 11·2 years for women), Santiago (8·9 years for men and 17·7 years for women), and Mexico City (10·9 years for men and 9·4 years for women), and the narrowest in Buenos Aires (4·4 years for men and 5·8 years for women), Belo Horizonte (4·0 years for men and 6·5 years for women), and San José (3·9 years for men and 3·0 years for women). Higher area-level socioeconomic status was associated with higher life expectancy, especially in Santiago (change in life expectancy per P90–P10 change unit-level of educational attainment 8·0 years [95% CI 5·8–10·3] for men and 11·8 years [7·1–16·4] for women) and Panama City (8·0 years [4·4–11·6] for men and 10·0 years [4·2–15·8] for women). We saw an increase in life expectancy at birth from east to west in Panama City and from north to south in core Mexico City, and a core-periphery divide in Buenos Aires and Santiago. Whereas for San José the central part of the city had the lowest life expectancy and in Belo Horizonte the central part of the city had the highest life expectancy.InterpretationLarge spatial differences in life expectancy in Latin American cities and their association with social factors highlight the importance of area-based approaches and policies that address social inequalities in improving health in cities of the region.FundingWellcome Trust.",

    "ab": "Air pollution and its adverse effects on public health remain a considerable problem in China, where policies have been implemented to improve the situation. We aimed to estimate the disease burden associated with particulate matter (PM)2·5 across China for 2020 and 2030 to identify the populations and regions most at risk, quantify the health benefits of air quality improvement targets, and determine the effect of population growth and ageing on this disease burden.In this modelling study, we investigated premature deaths associated with PM2·5 across China on the basis of air quality scenarios proposed by the expert group involved in the formulation of the 13th Five-Year Plan for Eco-Environmental Protection and population scenarios based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We used the integrated exposure-response model used for the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate the number of PM2·5-related premature deaths under each scenario.The projected health benefits of the air-quality-improving targets are substantial, and could reduce the number of PM2.5-related premature deaths in China by approximately 129 278 by 2020 and 217 988 by 2030, compared with 2010. However, since China's population is increasing and ageing, the number of PM2.5-related premature deaths was estimated to increase by 84 102 by 2020 and by 244 191 by 2030, indicating that the health benefits induced by air quality improvements could be offset by the effect of the population increasing in size and ageing.To reduce the future disease burden in China, targets that are stricter than the interim target and stringent policies to improve air quality and protect public health are needed, especially for at-risk population groups, such as older individuals (aged >55 years) and patients with cardiovascular diseases, particularly in regions with a high disease burden.National Key Research and Development Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Beijing Natural Science Foundation, National High-level Talents Special Support Plan of China for Young Talents, and Special Foundation of Basic Science and Technology Resources Survey of Ministry of Science and Technology of China.",

    "ab": "BackgroundLand use changes disrupt ecosystems, altering the transmission of vector-borne diseases. These changes have been associated with increasing incidence of zoonotic malaria caused by Plasmodium knowlesi; however, the population-level distributions of infection and exposure remain unknown. We aimed to measure prevalence of serological exposure to P knowlesi and assess associated risk factors.MethodsWe did an environmentally stratified, population-based, cross-sectional survey across households in the Kudat, Kota Marudu, Pitas, and Ranau districts in northern Sabah, Malaysia, encompassing a range of ecologies. Using blood samples, the transmission intensity of P knowlesi and other malaria species was measured by specific antibody prevalence and infection detected using molecular methods. Proportions and configurations of land types were extracted from maps derived from satellite images; a data-mining approach was used to select variables. A Bayesian hierarchical model for P knowlesi seropositivity was developed, incorporating questionnaire data about individual and household-level risk factors with selected landscape factors.FindingsBetween Sept 17, 2015, and Dec 12, 2015, 10 100 individuals with a median age of 25 years (range 3 months to 105 years) were sampled from 2849 households in 180 villages. 5·1% (95% CI 4·8–5·4) were seropositive for P knowlesi, and marked historical decreases were observed in the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Nine Plasmodium spp infections were detected. Age, male sex, contact with macaques, forest use, and raised house construction were positively associated with P knowlesi exposure, whereas residing at higher geographical elevations and use of insecticide were protective. Agricultural and forest variables, such as proportions and fragmentation of land cover types, predicted exposure at different spatial scales from households.InterpretationAlthough few infections were detected, P knowlesi exposure was observed in all demographic groups and was associated with occupational factors. Results suggest that agricultural expansion and forest fragmentation affect P knowlesi exposure, supporting linkages between land use change and P knowlesi transmission.FundingUK Medical Research Council, Natural Environment Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, and Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council.",

    "ab": "Lifecourse epidemiology is a conceptual model of epidemiological thinking that emerged in the 1990s and is now a mainstream paradigm in social epidemiology;1Galea S Link BG Six paths for the future of social epidemiology.Am J Epidemiol. 2013; 178: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar it focuses on long-term biological, behavioural, and psychosocial processes that link non-communicable disease (NCD) occurrence to physical and social exposures that act before disease endpoints, starting from the preconception period.2Ben-Shlomo Y Kuh D A life course approach to chronic disease epidemiology: conceptual models, empirical challenges and interdisciplinary perspectives.Int J Epidemiol. 2002; 31: 285-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Such lifecourse exposures have recently been framed as the exposome, which can be further divided into the internal, general-external, and specific-external exposome.3Wild CP Complementing the genome with an \"exposome\": the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2005; 14: 1847-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 4Turner MC Nieuwenhuijsen M Anderson K et al.Assessing the Exposome with External Measures: Commentary on the State of the Science and Research Recommendations.Annu Rev Public Health. 2017; 38: 215-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar However, the external exposome has been measured less than the internal exposome because of its complexity. In addition, environmental epidemiology is facing challenges in the assessment of the health effects of a large number of low-level correlated exposures. More accurate and sensitive measures of exposures than those currently available and the implementation of epidemiological studies over large areas are needed.5Pekkanen J Pearce N Environmental epidemiology: challenges and opportunities.Environ Health Perspect. 2001; 109: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Stingone JA Buck Louis GM Nakayama SF et al.Toward greater implementation of the exposome research paradigm within environmental epidemiology.Annu Rev Public Health. 2017; 38: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar This is where advanced spatial and location-based technologies, such as earth observation, sensors, smartphone apps, and the so-called internet of things, can step in and contribute to overcoming the data bottleneck that conventional epidemiology is facing.7Loh M Sarigiannis D Gotti A et al.How sensors might help define the external exposome.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2017; 14: 434Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Jia P Stein A Using remote sensing technology to measure environmental determinants of non-communicable diseases.Int J Epidemiol. 2017; 46: 1343-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar The use of advanced spatial and location-based technologies forms the foundation of spatial lifecourse epidemiology (figure). Since spatial lifecourse epidemiology emerged in an era of transdisciplinary collaboration and team-science initiatives, it aims to use those advanced technologies to investigate long-term effects and mechanisms of measurable environmental, behavioural, and psychosocial factors on individual disease risk at an unprecedented degree of accuracy. For example, earth-observation technologies can measure multiple dimensions of the environment across time and space more accurately, broadly, and frequently than traditional technologies; Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled devices can capture individual time-activity patterns; smartphone apps can track individual dietary intake and physical activity. With the support of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), all these measures can be processed and integrated to obtain precise estimates of individuals' external exposomes, which can further be associated with health outcomes.9Jia P Cheng X Xue H Wang Y Applications of geographic information systems (GIS) data and methods in obesity-related research.Obes rev. 2017; 18: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar Notably, earth-observation technologies can provide large-scale (even global) environmental measures and GPS technologies can provide momentary activity measures, both in a cost-effective way. Hence, these technologies make it possible to include all levels of variables—from the individual to the ecosystem—in spatial lifecourse epidemiological studies. Earth-observation technologies feature the acquisition and processing of satellite data, and have been applied to a wide range of areas including public health;10Jia P Sankoh O Tatem AJ Mapping the environmental and socioeconomic coverage of the INDEPTH international health and demographic surveillance system network.Health Place. 2015; 36: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Wang J Jia P Cuadros DF et al.A Remote sensing data based artificial neural network approach for predicting climate-sensitive infectious disease outbreaks: a case study of human brucellosis.Remote Sensing. 2017; 9: 1018Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar however, they have not been involved in NCD studies as much as in studies of infectious diseases, which have been the subject of intensive spatial epidemiological studies.12Elliott P Wartenberg D Spatial epidemiology: current approaches and future challenges.Environ Health Perspect. 2004; 112: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar Together with other technologies, earth-observation technologies have enabled inexpensive and high-throughput measurement of the general-external exposome in the context of lifecourse epidemiology, and the accuracy of such exposome measurements could match the accuracy of genome sequencing technologies at large scales. Moreover, the high temporal-resolution earth-observation data can match repeated measurement of psychosocial and biological exposures in cohort studies better than do GIS data, validate retrospectively recalled exposure from questionnaires or historical records (eg, work histories) or, if such records do not exist, reconstruct past environmental exposures. Earth-observation data are also more likely than GIS data to cover sensitive or critical periods. All these features will contribute substantially to improved strategies of disease prevention by refining the estimates of long-term cumulative exposures, the effects of exposure during sensitive or critical periods, and the definition of sensitive or critical periods. Spatial lifecourse epidemiology can address several challenges of lifecourse epidemiology.13Kuh D Ben-Shlomo Y Lynch J Hallqvist J Power C Life course epidemiology.J Epidemiol Community Health. 2003; 57: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar First, spatial lifecourse epidemiology outperforms lifecourse epidemiology in explaining temporal, geographical, and social patterns of disease distribution. Second, spatial data could assist in explaining underlying biological, psychological, social, and—in particular—behavioural processes that operate across an individual's life course or across generations. Third, spatial technologies can measure time-varying contextual variables, so the effects of changing contexts over time on the individual's life course can be investigated. Such frequent measurement of the environment will also offer increased opportunities to study gene–environment interactions. Fourth, spatial lifecourse epidemiology will provide fine-scale measurements over time, which has potential to overcome the modifiable areal-unit problem—faced by both lifecourse and environmental epidemiology5Pekkanen J Pearce N Environmental epidemiology: challenges and opportunities.Environ Health Perspect. 2001; 109: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar—and to detect small effects more reliably. Fifth, considering expensive labour costs and tight research budgets, volunteered GIS via smartphone apps can be used as a cost-effective source of geographic data and offer a number of fruitful paths toward collecting individual data and improving health behaviours through online citizen involvement. Finally, when translating knowledge into interventions and policy recommendations, earth observation data can measure many environmental factors at a large scale, so local epidemiology can be considered and interventions scaled up. The International Initiative on Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology (ISLE), established as a global transdisciplinary collaborative research network, is comprised mainly of experts from the fields of epidemiology, spatial science, geography, nutrition, biostatistics, ecology, urban planning, health economy, and health policy. The ISLE envisions a planet where everyone can achieve their fullest health and wellbeing potentials and benefits—ie, where everyone can breathe, drink, eat, and act healthfully, and hence maintain a healthy status and enjoy the resulting multifaceted benefits (panel).PanelSpecific aims of the International Initiative on Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology (ISLE)•Facilitate the use of state-of-the-art spatial and location-based technologies in human health research•Facilitate data sharing, integration, and comparison of results across different contexts•Develop protocols to format the reporting standards for studies in which spatial and big data are included in epidemiological studies•Review on a regular basis the evidence on the long-term effects of environmental factors on NCDs and risk factors, and provide evidence to policy-makers for intervening in the environment and preventing environment-related and lifestyle-related NCDs•Hold an annual or biennial symposium to discuss the state-of-the-art of spatial lifecourse epidemiology and deliver a postsymposium white paper that tracks the progress of spatial lifecourse epidemiology and updates the top research priorities in this field •Facilitate the use of state-of-the-art spatial and location-based technologies in human health research•Facilitate data sharing, integration, and comparison of results across different contexts•Develop protocols to format the reporting standards for studies in which spatial and big data are included in epidemiological studies•Review on a regular basis the evidence on the long-term effects of environmental factors on NCDs and risk factors, and provide evidence to policy-makers for intervening in the environment and preventing environment-related and lifestyle-related NCDs•Hold an annual or biennial symposium to discuss the state-of-the-art of spatial lifecourse epidemiology and deliver a postsymposium white paper that tracks the progress of spatial lifecourse epidemiology and updates the top research priorities in this field The 1st International Symposium on Lifecourse Epidemiology and Spatial Science was held on July 16–20, 2018, at the Lorentz Center in Leiden, the Netherlands. A group of multidisciplinary experts in the fields of spatial science, lifecourse epidemiology, environmental epidemiology, health geography, environmental science, and landscape ecology, gathered to share the state-of-the-art in each respective area, and were committed to deliver two scientific outputs: how spatial sciences and technologies can advance traditional lifecourse epidemiology, and the top-ten key research priorities in spatial lifecourse epidemiology. Spatial lifecourse epidemiology is the intersection of spatial science and lifecourse epidemiology in an era of big data. The interest of spatial lifecourse epidemiology is to know not only when and where disease occurs, but also when, where, and how previous exposures occur, so the aetiology can be investigated and points of intervention identified. Spatial lifecourse epidemiology will accumulate evidence of long-term and lifecourse effects of environmental exposure on human health for intervention design and policy changes while preparing for the coming abundant true lifecourse data, and will also help to realise strategic global health goals and ISLE's overall vision. I declare no competing interest.

    "ab": "BackgroundThe health sector plays an important part in adapting to climate change; however, the sector is also responsible for significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In high-income countries, the carbon footprints of health-care systems have been estimated to be 3–10% of the total national GHG emissions, but no in-depth investigation has been done for China. This study aims to examine the carbon footprint of the Chinese health-care system and identify emission hotspots.MethodsEnvironmentally extended input–output analysis and structural path analysis were used to assess the lifecycle GHG emissions of the Chinese health-care system. A satellite account of GHG emissions was constructed for 46 economic sectors in China using energy data from the National Bureau of Statistics based on the numbers reported by a large number of enterprises. Data on health expenditure for medical institutions, pharmaceuticals, construction, administration, and research were obtained from multiple Chinese official statistics yearbooks and the national input–output table.FindingsIn 2012, China spent CNY 2539 billion on health care, leading to emissions of 315 (68% CI 267–363) megatonnes CO2 equivalent. Health care accounted for 2·7% (68% CI 2·3–3·1) of China's total GHG emissions. The major contributors of GHG emissions in the health-care system were public hospitals (148 megatonnes [47%]), non-hospital purchased pharmaceuticals (56 megatonnes [18%]), and construction (46 megatonnes [15%]). In medical institutions, energy use for buildings and transport accounted for only 16% of the total carbon footprint, whereas 84% was embodied in the purchased goods and services.InterpretationChina has a much smaller health-care carbon footprint per capita than developed countries, such as the USA and Australia. However, its carbon emissions per unit of health expenditure are relatively high because of the expenditure structure and the carbon intensity of the country's entire economy. The results suggest the need for a nationwide carbon-efficient target for health care and use of low-carbon alternatives in making supply chain choices to achieve reductions in the carbon footprint.FundingNatural Science Foundation of China.",

    "ab": "The field of planetary health has emerged as a way to prevent further destabilisation of the earth systems and to avoid actions that would herald large-scale morbidity and mortality.1Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of the Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar Health professionals—who have been trained to advocate for health, communicate risk, and manage complex systems—are ideally placed to raise awareness of and educate about planetary health. Many clinicians realise that the health-care systems in which they work leave deep environmental footprints. Yet the clinician's voice has been inexplicably quiet on global-ecological change. Why is this so, and what can be done about it? The educational directives that dictate the training of health professional are notoriously slow to change. New evidence and social norms are incorporated only by the dedicated efforts of change agents at national or institutional levels.2Bland CJ Starnaman S Wersal L Moorehead-Rosenberg L Zonia S Henry R Curricular change in medical schools: how to succeed.Acad Med. 2000; 75: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar Clinical educators at faculty and dean level have generally resisted the inclusion of planetary health in their undergraduate and postgraduate curricula, either because they are not aware how important the topic is or because they tend to focus on illness treatment over prevention. In all settings, there is a dearth of curricular space and faculty expertise.3Walpole SC Vyas A Maxwell J et al.Building an environmentally accountable medical curriculum through international collaboration.Med Teach. 2017; 39: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar For the past 10 years, the Sustainable Healthcare Education network has experimented with ways of including planetary health literacy in clinical training. Three learning objectives (panel 1) have been established that link the relationship between ecosystems and human health to the skills needed to reduce the environmental impacts of health systems, and include environmental considerations in clinical ethical reasoning).4Walpole SC Mortimer F Inman A Braithwaite I Thompson T Exploring emerging learning needs: a UK-wide consultation on environmental sustainability learning objectives for medical education.Int J Med Educ. 2015; 6: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google ScholarPanel 1Sustainable Healthcare Education learning outcomes1Describe how the environment and human health interact at different levels.2Demonstrate the knowledge and skills needed to improve the environmental sustainability of health systems.3Discuss how the duty of a doctor to protect and promote health is shaped by the dependence of human health on the local and global environment. 1Describe how the environment and human health interact at different levels.2Demonstrate the knowledge and skills needed to improve the environmental sustainability of health systems.3Discuss how the duty of a doctor to protect and promote health is shaped by the dependence of human health on the local and global environment. The Sustainable Healthcare Education network has succeeded in changing health professional curricula at several levels. First, at the national level, academics, clinicians, and students have gathered evidence to justify the inclusion of sustainable healthcare learning objectives in the UK national medical curriculum.4Walpole SC Mortimer F Inman A Braithwaite I Thompson T Exploring emerging learning needs: a UK-wide consultation on environmental sustainability learning objectives for medical education.Int J Med Educ. 2015; 6: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar These learning objectives have also been taken up by nurse educators in Europe and medical educators in the USA. Second, within the health services groundbreaking work has been done to develop models of sustainable clinical specialties (eg, green nephrology, sustainable psychiatry, and sustainable primary care).5Mortimer F The sustainable physician.Clinical Medicine. 2010; 10: 110-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar Moreover, professional working groups have been formed, including groups for occupational therapy and physiotherapy. Third, individual institutions have made planetary health education clinically relevant by publishing case studies and teaching materials, developing educational activities and approaches (panel 2), and introducing peer-to-peer training for medical faculty.6Walpole SC Mortimer F Evaluation of a collaborative project to develop sustainable healthcare education in eight uk medical schools.Public Health. 2017; 150: 134-148Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar Some institutions have also listened to student perspectives to co-develop and co-deliver teaching,7Musaeus P Wellbery C Walpole S Rother H-A Vyas A Leedham-Green K E-collaborating for environmentally sustainable health curricula.in: Azeiteiro UM Filho WL Aires L Climate literacy and innovations in climate change education.

    "ab": "BackgroundSeveral small experimental studies and cross-sectional observational studies have shown that exposure to the natural environment might protect against attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or moderate the symptoms of ADHD in children. We aimed to assess whether exposure to the natural environment protects against ADHD and whether this hypothesised protective effect varies across a child's life course.MethodsWe did a longitudinal study with data collected from all children born in New Zealand in 1998, excluding those without an address history, those who were not singleton births, and those who died or emigrated before 18 years of age. We used Statistics New Zealand's Integrated Data Infrastructure to identify children with ADHD and to define covariates. ADHD was defined according to hospital diagnosis or pharmacy records (two or more prescriptions for ADHD drugs). Exposure to green space for each year of a child's life (from gestation to 18 years of age) was estimated at the meshblock level (the smallest geographical unit for which the New Zealand Census reports data) using normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land-use data from Landcare Research New Zealand. We used logit models to assess the associations between ADHD prevalence and minimum, maximum, and mean lifetime NDVI, as well as rural living, controlling for sex, ethnicity, mother's educational level, mother's smoking status, mother's age at parturition, birth order, antibiotic use, and low birthweight.FindingsOf the 57 450 children born in New Zealand in 1998, 49 923 were eligible and had available data, and were included in the analysis. Children who had always lived in a rural area after 2 years of age were less likely to develop ADHD (odds ratio [OR] 0·670 [95% CI 0·461–0·974), as were those with increased minimum NDVI exposure after age 2 years (standardised OR for exposure vs first quartile: second quartile 0·841 [0·707–0·999]; third quartile 0·809 [0·680–0·963]; fourth quartile 0·664 [0·548–0·805]). In early life (prenatal to age 2 years), neither rural living nor NDVI were protective against ADHD. Neither mean nor maximum greenness was significantly protective against ADHD.InterpretationRurality and increased minimum greenness were strongly and independently associated with a reduced risk of ADHD. Increasing a child's minimum lifetime greenness exposure, as opposed to maximum or mean exposure, might provide the greatest increment of protection against the disorder.FundingNone.",

    "ab": "BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance is one of the great challenges facing global health security in the modern era. Wildlife, particularly those that use urban environments, are an important but understudied component of epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. We investigated antimicrobial resistance overlap between sympatric wildlife, humans, livestock, and their shared environment across the developing city of Nairobi, Kenya. We use these data to examine the role of urban wildlife in the spread of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance.Methods99 households across Nairobi were randomly selected on the basis of socioeconomic stratification. A detailed survey was administered to household occupants, and samples (n=2102) were collected from the faeces of 75 wildlife species inhabiting household compounds (ie, the household and its perimeter; n=849), 13 livestock species (n=656), and humans (n=333), and from the external environment (n=288). Escherichia coli, our sentinel organism, was cultured and a single isolate from each sample tested for sensitivity to 13 antibiotics. Diversity of antimicrobial resistant phenotypes was compared between urban wildlife, humans, livestock, and the environment, to investigate whether wildlife are a net source for antimicrobial resistance in Nairobi. Generalised linear mixed models were used to determine whether the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant phenotypes and multidrug-resistant E coli carriage in urban wildlife is linked to variation in ecological traits, such as foraging behaviour, and to determine household-level risk factors for sharing of antimicrobial resistance between humans, wildlife, and livestock.FindingsE coli were isolated from 485 samples collected from wildlife between Sept 6,2015, and Sept 28, 2016. Wildlife carried a low prevalence of E coli isolates susceptible to all antibiotics tested (45 [9%] of 485 samples) and a high prevalence of clinically relevant multidrug resistance (252 [52%] of 485 samples), which varied between taxa and by foraging traits. Multiple isolates were resistant to one agent from at least seven antimicrobial classes tested for, and a single isolate was resistant to all antibiotics tested for in the study. The phenotypic diversity of antimicrobial-resistant E coli in wildlife was lower than in livestock, humans, and the environment. Within household compounds, statistical models identified two interfaces for exchange of antimicrobial resistance: between both rodents, humans and their rubbish, and seed-eating birds, humans and their rubbish; and between seed-eating birds, cattle, and bovine manure.InterpretationUrban wildlife carry a high burden of clinically relevant antimicrobial-resistant E coli in Nairobi, exhibiting resistance to drugs considered crucial for human medicine by WHO. Identifiable traits of the wildlife contribute to this exposure; however, compared with humans, livestock, and the environment, low phenotypic diversity in wildlife is consistent with the hypothesis that wildlife are a net sink rather than source of clinically relevant resistance. Wildlife that interact closely with humans, livestock, and both human and livestock waste within households, are exposed to more antimicrobial resistant phenotypes, and could therefore act as conduits for the dissemination of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance to the wider environment. These results provide novel insight into the broader epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in complex urban environments, characteristic of lower-middle-income countries.FundingUK Medical Research Council and CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health.",

    "ab": "The universal adoption of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is a strong sign of global interest in integrating economic, social, and environmental considerations in the development aspirations of UN member states. An ambitious outcome of such an integrated perspective is a substantial improvement in public health and social wellbeing while safeguarding the natural and economic systems on which these rely.1Pradyumna A Planetary health and food systems: insights from global SDGs.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e417-e418Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar Although the SDGs have been adopted by heads of state, the UN has emphasised the need for a united effort from state and non-state actors at multiple levels of society2UNTransforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworldDate: 2015Date accessed: March 20, 2019Google Scholar—a move beyond top-down strategies3Hajer M Nilsson M Raworth K et al.Beyond cockpit-ism: four insights to enhance the transformative potential of the Sustainable Development Goals.Sustainability. 2015; 7: 1651-1660Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar and a call for action from new agents of change, including businesses, cities, and local communities. This need highlights not only the continued investigation of global change and its effects across all dimensions of planetary health, but also the requirement for more nuanced investigation of the roles of bottom-up action from society. Despite the think globally, act locally mantra in sustainability and the general agreement on the necessity of bottom-up action for achieving the SDGs, less agreement exists about how to instigate and realise local actions. We contend that mobilising new agents of change for the SDGs requires innovations in governance, and that those innovations need to draw on a critical scrutiny of experiences gathered from decades of work in the field of sustainable development. To achieve this goal, we propose a participatory and inclusive governance agenda, which we term Local Agenda 2030. A Local Agenda 2030 conceptualisation acknowledges that engagement with the SDGs will differ according to local sociocultural, economic, and environmental contexts; policy agendas; institutional arrangements; social and human capital; and financial resources. We envisage Local Agenda 2030 to include a practical framework that can be adapted to any local community aimed at collectively achieving the global goals from the bottom up. Implementation will require a downscaling of the SDGs by identifying locally relevant indicators and setting sustainability targets, then identifying actions and shaping robust pathways for achieving them. Highly nuanced local conditions and capacities demand a plurality of bespoke qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches to codevelop this information with communities and stakeholders. This situation also requires an understanding of alternative transformation narratives, pertaining to both systems of sustainable production (such as a transition to renewable energy to reduce industrial emissions intensity) and consumption (such as a transition to healthier, more sustainable diets).4Hadjikakou M Ritchie EG Watermeyer KE Bryan BA Improving the assessment of food system sustainability.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e62-e63Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar Local Agenda 2030 embraces diversity and complexity in local context, ways of knowing, and perspectives about the preferred pathways towards sustainability,5Barnett J Graham S Mortreux C Fincher R Waters E Hurlimann A A local coastal adaptation pathway.Nat Clim Change. 2014; 4: 1103-1108Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar while also recognising the linkages and potential trade-offs between sustainability aspirations at multiple scales. Importantly, we are not claiming here that Local Agenda 2030 is a new approach. Initiatives are already underway that align with our Local Agenda 2030. The UN Global Compact has implemented the Local Network SDG Action Plan,6UNLocal Network SDG Action Plan.https://www.unglobalcompact.org/sdgs/ln-action-planDate accessed: April 29, 2019Google Scholar a business-oriented approach to raising SDG awareness and building partnerships at the local level.

Localising the SDGs8Localizing the SDGsAbout us.http://localizingthesdgs.org/about-us.phpDate accessed: March 29, 2019Google Scholar is assembling a knowledge base and toolbox of local experiences with implementing various aspects of the SDGs including planning, governance, and capacity building. We must learn from experience, in particular that of Local Agenda 21 (LA21),9International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI)The Local Agenda 21 initiative: ICLEI guidelines for Local Agenda 21. ICLEI, Freiburg1993Google Scholar to which our call for a renewed local emphasis pays homage in name. The extensive adoption of LA21 in more than 6400 local authorities in 113 countries demonstrated how the engagement of communities—as a local level of governance—is essential for the successful implementation of the sustainable development agenda. In pursuing Local Agenda 2030, we need to critically review the outcomes of LA21 and other locally focused initiatives to understand the opportunities and challenges faced in this endeavour. For example, the absence of strong financial support and long-term political commitment impeded the implementation of LA21 actions.10Fidélis T Pires SM Surrender or resistance to the implementation of Local Agenda 21 in Portugal: the challenges of local governance for sustainable development.J Environ Plan Manag. 2009; 52: 497-518Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar Therefore, deep consideration of the economic and political capacity of local communities could be a determinant for the success of Local Agenda 2030. Understanding socioeconomic inequality—to ensure that the health and wellbeing of low-income, middle-income, and high-income communities are equally accounted for—is also an essential prerequisite for achieving the SDGs.11Balasubramanian M Climate change, famine, and low-income communities challenge Sustainable Development Goals.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e421-e422Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar While acknowledging the importance of previous lessons, we also need to renew our governance perspectives and incorporate emerging approaches in the science–policy interface12Schot J Steinmueller WE Three frames for innovation policy: R&D, systems of innovation and transformative change.Research Policy. 2018; 47: 1554-1567Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar to open up spaces for experimentation13Evans J Karvonen A Raven RPJM The experimental city.

We argue that such an approach is crucial to support actions aimed at enhancing planetary health and sustainable prosperity.

    "ab": "The role of environmental exposures in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains inconclusive. We examined the association between environmental exposures (PM2·5, greenness, and urbanicity) and COPD prevalence using the UK Biobank cohort data to identify key built environment correlates of COPD.In this cross-sectional, observational study we used baseline data for UK Biobank participants. Included participants were aged 39 years and older, white, had available spirometry data, and had complete data for phenotypes and exposures. COPD was defined by spirometry with the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria. Environmental exposures were PM2·5 derived from monitoring data and interpolated using land-use regression at the participants' geocoded residential addresses. Built environment metrics of residential greenness were modelled in terms of normalised difference vegetation index from remotely sensed colour infrared data within a 500 m residential catchment, and an urbanicity index derived from spatial analyses and measured with a 1 km buffer around each participant's residential address. Logistic regression models examined the associations between environmental exposures and COPD prevalence adjusting for a range of confounders. Subgroup analyses by urbanicity and effect modification by white blood cell count as an inflammatory marker were also done.We assessed 96 779 participants recruited between April 4, 2006, and Oct 1, 2010, of which 5391 participants had COPD with a prevalence of 5·6%. Each 10 μg/m3 increment in ambient PM2·5 exposure at a participant's residential location was associated with higher odds of COPD (odds ratio 1·55, 95% CI 1·14-2·10). Among the built environment metrics, urbanicity was associated with higher odds of COPD (1·05, 1·01-1·08 per interquartile increment), whereas residential greenness was protective, being associated with lower odds of COPD (0·89, 0·84-0·93 for each interquartile increment in greenness). The results remained consistent in models of COPD defined as per lower limit of normal criteria. The highest quartile of white blood cell count was associated with lower lung function and higher COPD risk with a significant interaction between PM2·5 and white blood cell count only in the model of lung function (p=0·0003).In this study of the built environment and COPD, to our knowledge the largest done in the UK, we found that exposure to ambient PM2·5 and urbanicity were associated with a higher risk of COPD. Residing in greener areas, as measured by normalised difference vegetation index, was associated with lower odds of COPD, suggesting the potential value of urban planning and design in minimising or offsetting environmental risks for the prevention and management of COPD.University of Hong Kong, UK Biobank, and UK Economic & Social Research Council.",

    "ab": "Greenhouse gas emissions are affecting the quantity and quality of our food in two ways. First, they are driving anthropogenic climate change, which decreases yields of major cereal crops in some regions. Increased temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, increased ozone concentrations, and more frequent and extreme heatwaves, floods, and droughts can reduce crop yields, particularly in the tropics, with risks increasing with additional warming depending on the region.1Porter JR Xie L Challiinor AJ et al.Food security and food production systems.in: Field CB Barros VR Dokken DJ Climate change 2014: impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability. Part A: global and sectoral aspects. Contribution of working group II to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and New York, NY2014: 485-533Google Scholar Lower crop yields increase stunting and wasting, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries.1Porter JR Xie L Challiinor AJ et al.Food security and food production systems.in: Field CB Barros VR Dokken DJ Climate change 2014: impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability. Part A: global and sectoral aspects. Contribution of working group II to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and New York, NY2014: 485-533Google Scholar Second, increased concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2)—by directly affecting plants—worsen the nutritional quality of food by decreasing protein and mineral concentrations by 5–15%, and B vitamins by up to a 30%.2Loladze I Hidden shift of the ionome of plants exposed to elevated CO2 depletes minerals at the base of human nutrition.eLife. 2014; 3e02245Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 3Myers SS Zanobetti A Kloog I et al.Increasing CO2 threatens human nutrition.Nature. 2014; 510: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 4Zhu C Kobayashi K Loladze I et al.Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels this century will alter the protein, micronutrients, and vitamin content of rice grains with potential health consequences for the poorest rice-dependent countries.Sci Adv. 2018; 4eaaq1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar Higher CO2 concentrations increase photosynthesis in C3 plants (eg, wheat, rice, potatoes, barley), which can increase crop yields. But those increases come at the cost of lower nutritional quality as plants accumulate more carbohydrates and less minerals (eg, iron and zinc), which can negatively affect human nutrition.5Loladze I Rising atmospheric CO2 and human nutrition: toward globally imbalanced plant stoichiometry?.Trends Ecol Evol. 2002; 17: 457-461Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (290) Google Scholar Thus, accurately quantifying the effect of increasing CO2 concentrations on human nutrition requires accounting for changes in the quantity and quality of crop harvests and diets and economic parameters (eg, food prices). Decreases in the nutritional quality of crops related to CO2 will exacerbate current challenges. As of 2017, 821 million people globally are food insecure, with 22% of children (151 million) stunted and 7·5% (over 50 million) wasted.6Food and Agriculture Organization of the United NationsInternational Fund for Agricultural DevelopmentUNICEFWorld Food ProgrammeWHOThe state of food security and nutrition in the world. Building climate resilience for food security and nutrition. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome2018: 202Google Scholar Micronutrient deficiencies cause a much larger burden of disease than food insecurity, with approximately 2 billion people having deficiencies in iron, zinc, and other micronutrients in 2003.6Food and Agriculture Organization of the United NationsInternational Fund for Agricultural DevelopmentUNICEFWorld Food ProgrammeWHOThe state of food security and nutrition in the world. Building climate resilience for food security and nutrition. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome2018: 202Google Scholar These deficiencies adversely affect cognitive development, metabolism, obesity, diabetes, and other health outcomes, potentially affecting health and welfare across the life course. In The Lancet Planetary Health, Robert Beach and colleagues7Beach RH Sulser TB Crimmins A et al.Combining the effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide on protein, iron, and zinc availability and projected climate change on global diets: a modelling study.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e307-e317Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar accounted for projected climate change and fertilisation effects of CO2 on crop yields and projected CO2 effects on the concentrations of iron, zinc, and protein in crops between 2010 and 2050. Using a global economic model of the agricultural sector, they show that technological changes, market responses, and the fertilisation effects of CO2 on yields are projected to increase the global availability of dietary protein, iron, and zinc. The authors then used two independently derived datasets of the effects of increasing CO2 on crop quality: a subset of data restricted to edible tissues from Loladze (2014);2Loladze I Hidden shift of the ionome of plants exposed to elevated CO2 depletes minerals at the base of human nutrition.eLife. 2014; 3e02245Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar and data supporting Myers et al (2014)3Myers SS Zanobetti A Kloog I et al.Increasing CO2 threatens human nutrition.Nature. 2014; 510: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar with the wheat portion from Fernando (2013).8Fernando ND Wheat grain quality dynamics under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration in Mediterranean climate conditions. The University of Melbourne, 2013Google Scholar All the data were restricted to nitrogen (as a proxy for protein), iron, and zinc. The authors combined these datasets with economic projections of shifts in global diets, crop production, food prices, and income to project decreases in global availability of protein, iron, and zinc of 2·5–4·1% by midcentury, compared with estimates that ignore the effects of increased CO2 on crop quality. These decreases are expected to slow progress in achieving reductions in global nutrient deficiencies, disproportionately affecting countries that already have high levels of nutritional deficieny. Other modeling estimates also project negative effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations on human nutrition by mid-century. Weyant and colleagues9Weyant C Brandeau ML Burke M Lobell DB Bendavid E Basu S Anticipated burden and mitigation of carbon-dioxide-induced nutritional deficiencies and related diseases: a simulation modeling study.PLoS Med. 2018; 15e1002586Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar accounted for climate change and dietary patterns to project that CO2-induced reductions in the concentrations of zinc and iron in crops alone could induce 125·8 million disability-adjusted life-years globally, with southeast Asian and sub-Saharan African countries being most affected. Smith and Myers10Smith MR Myers SS Impact of anthropogenic CO2 emissions on global human nutrition.Nat Clim Chang. 2018; 8: 834-839Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar assumed no changes in diets but accounted for decreases in nutrient content of crops to project that an additional 175 million people could become zinc deficient and an additional 122 million people could become protein deficient. Zhu and colleagues4Zhu C Kobayashi K Loladze I et al.Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels this century will alter the protein, micronutrients, and vitamin content of rice grains with potential health consequences for the poorest rice-dependent countries.Sci Adv. 2018; 4eaaq1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar estimate that 600 million people will be at risk later this century in countries with the highest levels of rice consumption and the lowest overall gross domestic product per capita. Modeling efforts need to be expanded from focusing on iron and zinc to include other minerals essential for human nutrition, including calcium and magnesium, which also decrease in plants exposed to higher CO2 concentrations.2Loladze I Hidden shift of the ionome of plants exposed to elevated CO2 depletes minerals at the base of human nutrition.eLife. 2014; 3e02245Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar The inclusion of these micronutrients is needed to quantify the total possible effect of increasing CO2 concentrations on human health. For example, about 3·5 billion people are at risk of dietary calcium deficiency, without considering the potential effects of increasing CO2 concentrations.11Kumssa DB Joy EJM Ander EL et al.Dietary calcium and zinc deficiency risks are decreasing but remain prevalent.Sci Rep. 2015; 510974Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar The magnitude of the health risks will be amplified when one considers the potential effects of increased concentrations of CO2 on livestock, which contribute more than 15% of the global human protein supply. To quantify the trajectory of nutritional stress in cattle from reduction of nitrogen availability in grasslands caused by increasing CO2 concentrations, Craine and colleagues12Craine JM Elmore A Angerer JP Long-term declines in nutritional quality for North American cattle.Environ Res Lett. 2017; 12044019Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar examined dietary quality over 22 years for US cattle, standardising for several factors, including forage quality, and showed that cattle have been increasingly protein-stressed, probably decreasing weight gain in cattle. The replacement costs of decreased protein provision were estimated to be the equivalent of US$1·9 billion annually. Increasing research indicates that undernutrition will be the greatest health risk of increasing CO2 concentrations and climate change. Solutions urgently need to be found to ensure the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2 on food security. IL's data, which were used by Beach and colleagues, are open access; he commented on the initial analyses by Beach and colleagues to ensure appropriate weighting and interpolating the results to various carbon dioxide concentrations, but had no further role in development of the manuscript. KLE declares no competing interests. Combining the effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide on protein, iron, and zinc availability and projected climate change on global diets: a modelling studyThis approach is an improvement in estimating future global food security by simultaneously projecting climate change effects on crop productivity and changes in nutrient content under increased concentrations of CO2, which accounts for a much larger effect on nutrient availability than CO2 fertilisation. Regardless of the scenario used to project future consumption patterns, the net effect of increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 will slow progress in decreasing global nutrient deficiencies.

    "ab": "SummaryBackgroundThe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonotic pathogen endemic to the Arabian Peninsula. Dromedary camels are a likely source of infection and the virus probably originated in Africa. We studied the genetic diversity, geographical structure, infection prevalence, and age-associated prevalence among camels at the largest entry port of camels from Africa into the Arabian Peninsula.MethodsIn this prospective genomic study, we took nasal samples from camels imported from Sudan and Djibouti into the Port of Jeddah in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over an almost 2-year period and local Arabian camels over 2 months in the year after surveillance of the port. We determined the prevalence of MERS-CoV infection, age-associated patterns of infection, and undertook phylogeographical and migration analyses to determine intercountry virus transmission after local lineage establishment. We compared all virological characteristics between the local and imported cohorts. We compared major gene deletions between African and Arabian strains of the virus. Reproductive numbers were inferred with Bayesian birth death skyline analyses.FindingsBetween Aug 10, 2016, and May 3, 2018, we collected samples from 1196 imported camels, of which 868 originated from Sudan and 328 from Djibouti, and between May 1, and June 25, 2018, we collected samples from 472 local camels, of which 189 were from Riyadh and 283 were from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Virus prevalence was higher in local camels than in imported camels (224 [47·5%] of 472 vs 157 [13·1%] of 1196; p<0·0001). Infection prevalence peaked among camels older than 1 year and aged up to 2 years in both groups, with 255 (66·9%) of 381 positive cases in this age group. Although the overall geographical distribution of the virus corresponded with the phylogenetic tree topology, some virus exchange was observed between countries corresponding with trade routes in the region. East and west African strains of the virus appear to be geographically separated, with an origin of west African strains in east Africa. African strains of the virus were not re-sampled in Saudi Arabia despite sampling approximately 1 year after importation from Africa. All local Arabian samples contained strains of the virus that belong to a novel recombinant clade (NRC) first detected in 2014 in Saudi Arabia. Reproduction number estimates informed by the sequences suggest sustained endemicity of NRC, with a mean Re of 1·16.InterpretationDespite frequent imports of MERS-CoV with camels from Africa, African lineages of MERS-CoV do not establish themselves in Saudi Arabia. Arabian strains of the virus should be tested for changes in virulence and transmissibility.FundingGerman Ministry of Research and Education, EU Horizon 2020, and Emerging Diseases Clinical Trials Partnership.",

    "ab": "The association between urban greenspace and mortality risk is well known, but less is known about how the spatial arrangement of greenspace affects population health. We aimed to investigate the relation between urban greenspace distribution and mortality risk.We did a cross-sectional study in Philadelphia, PA, USA, using high-resolution landcover data for 2008 from the Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access database. We calculated landscape metrics to measure the greenness, fragmentation, connectedness, aggregation, and shape of greenspace, including and omitting green areas 83·6 m2 or smaller, using Geographical Information System and spatial pattern analysis programs. We analysed all-cause and cause-specific mortality (related to heart disease, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and neoplasms) recorded in 2006 for 369 census tracts (small geographical areas with a population of 2500-8000 people). We did negative binomial regression and principal component analyses to assess associations between landscape spatial metrics and mortality, controlling for geographical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors.A 1% increase in the percentage of greenspace was predicted to reduce all-cause mortality by 0·419% (95% CI 0·050-0·777), with no effect on cause-specific mortality. All-cause mortality was negatively associated with the area of greenspace. A 1 m2 increase in the mean area of greenspace led to a 0·011% (95% CI 0·004-0·018) fall in all-cause mortality and a 0·019% (0·007-0·032) decrease in cardiac mortality; considering only green areas larger than 83·6 m2 would contribute to a 0·002% (95% CI 0·001-0·003) decrease in all-cause mortality and a 0·003% (0·001-0·006) reduction in cardiac deaths. Census tracts with more connected, aggregated, coherent, and complex shape greenspaces had a lower risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The negative association between articulated landscape parcels and all-cause mortality varied with age and education, such that the relation was stronger for census tracts with a higher percentage of older and less well-educated adults.A significant modest association exists between the spatial distribution of greenspace in cities and mortality risk. The overall amount of greenspace alone is probably failing to capture significant variance in local health outcomes and, thus, environment-based health planning should consider the shape, form, and function of greenspace.None.",

    "ab": "The adoption of healthy and sustainable diets and food systems is recognised as a means to address the global challenge of malnutrition and poor-quality diets, and unprecedented environmental damage from food production and consumption.1 Sustainable diets have also been recognised as a key strategy to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Reducing consumption of animal-source foods is frequently presented as key to improving the sustainability of food systems.2 Fish and seafood can have a lower environmental impact and in many cases are considered more efficient than terrestrial animal production (albeit with wide variation) depending on the type of production or capture method,3 yet remain largely absent, or insufficiently articulated in the sustainable diets literature, rendering their future role in healthy diets unclear.",

    "ab": "BackgroundIncreasing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that maternal exposure to ambient PM2·5 can increase the risk of pregnancy loss. However, no studies have been done in low-income countries such as those in Africa, which have the highest incidences of pregnancy loss. In this study, we aimed to analyse the association between PM2·5 and pregnancy loss, including miscarriage and stillbirth.MethodsThis self-compared case control study collected data on mothers who reported at least two births (at least one case of pregnancy loss plus at least one normal delivery) in the African Demographic and Health Surveys. Gestational exposure to PM2·5 was assessed using a state-of-the-art estimator based on satellite measurements and chemical transport model outputs. Each case of pregnancy loss was compared with the successful control deliveries in the same mother. We estimated the association between gestational exposure to PM2·5 and pregnancy loss using a conditional logistical model with multiple adjustments, and assessed it using the odds ratio (OR) derived from the regression.FindingsBetween Jan 1, 1998, and Dec 31, 2016, 67 566 cases of pregnancy loss were reported across Africa in the DHS. After removal of mothers who did not report at least one successful delivery and those with missing spatial information, 42 952 were included in the study. Of these, 30 418 were categorised as miscarriages and 12 534 were stillbirths. Each increment of 10 μg/m3 PM2·5 was associated with an adjusted OR of 1·122 (95% CI 1·107–1·137) for pregnancy loss, including miscarriage (1·125; 1·109–1·142) and stillbirth (1·094; 1·051–1·138).InterpretationOur findings from African DHS data showing that PM2·5 exposure is significantly associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss add to the existing epidemiological evidence from middle-income and high-income countries on the health impacts of poor air quality. Our results support public health interventions for reducing ambient particulate matter to improve maternal health in Africa.FundingChina National Natural Science Foundation and China Ministry of Science and Technology.",

    "ab": "On June 28, 2019, a temperature of 45·9°C was recorded at a weather station in France, exceeding the country's previous temperature record—set during the infamous 2003 heatwave—by almost 2°C. The heatwave peaked over central and northern Europe, fuelled by a very persistent planetary-scale Rossby wave (giant meanders in upper-tropospheric winds), which turned into an omega block, so named because its shape resembles the Greek letter (Ω). This blocking event led to hot air from northern Africa being transferred to Europe (figure).1Kalnay E Kanamitsu M Kistler R et al.The NCEP/NCAR 40-year reanalysis project.Bull Amer Meteor Soc. 1996; 77: 437-470Crossref Scopus (24493) Google Scholar Given the extraordinary nature of this event, the public and media are now wondering: is such weather the new norm, and how bad could it get in the future? Although heatwaves have always occurred as an intrinsic part of our weather, strong evidence suggests that their frequency and magnitude are increasing because of anthropogenic climate change,2Stott PA Stone DA Allen MR Human contribution to the European heatwave of 2003.Nature. 2004; 432: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar and the 2019 event is no exception. Heatwaves are initiated by weather patterns, and atmospheric patterns similar to those responsible for this temperature record have been identified in many of the major European heatwaves observed over the past 20 years.3Kornhuber K Osprey S Coumou D et al.Extreme weather events in early summer 2018 connected by a recurrent hemispheric wave-7 pattern.Environ Res Lett. 2019; 14054002Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar These patterns often result in stationary high-pressure systems over western Europe. For instance, the simultaneous heatwaves over much of the northern hemisphere in the summer of 2018 happened during the occurrence of a high-amplitude and stationary Rossby wave, locked in position and likely to have been further reinforced by latent heating from dry soil regions.3Kornhuber K Osprey S Coumou D et al.Extreme weather events in early summer 2018 connected by a recurrent hemispheric wave-7 pattern.Environ Res Lett. 2019; 14054002Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar A detailed analysis of the 2018 event concluded that it was \"virtually certain\" that the heatwave was enhanced by human-induced climate change,4Vogel MM Zscheischler J Wartenburger R Dee D Seneviratne SI Concurrent 2018 hot extremes across Northern Hemisphere due to human-induced climate change.Earths Future. 2019; (published online June 7.)DOI:10.1029/2019EF001189Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar which prompts the question of whether such a statement applies to all factors that influenced the event. For instance, clusters of persistent high atmospheric pressure (ridges) have been observed over Europe over the past two decades, possibly explained by a slow-down of the mid-latitude summer circulation. However, projections showed that associated blocking is unlikely to change in the future based on traditional blocking metrics.5Woollings T Barriopedro D Methven J Blocking and its response to climate change.Curr Clim Change Rep. 2018; 4: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar Thus, the attribution of such circulation changes to anthropogenic greenhouse gases is still under investigation, but, either way, changes in heatwave statistics are probably being driven mainly by the background thermodynamic response of the atmosphere. The climate has warmed by around 1°C globally to date since pre-industrial conditions;6Stocker TF Qin D Plattner GK et al.Climate change 2013: the physical science basis. Working group I contribution to the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2013: 1535Google Scholar however, land areas,7Huntingford C Mercado LM High chance that current atmospheric greenhouse concentrations commit to warmings greater than 1.5°C over land.Sci Rep. 2016; 630294Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar particularly urban regions, are warming faster than the oceans, and the locations most relevant to human populations are therefore being more exposed to heat stress than this global average temperature increase implies. No event made this more apparent than the July–August 2003 heatwave, which saw around 15 000 heat-exposure-related deaths in France, and around 70 000 deaths across Europe.8Watts N Amann M Ayeb-Karlsson S et al.The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: from 25 years of inaction to a global transformation for public health.Lancet. 2018; 391: 581-630Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar Climate change had a significant role to play in 2003, with 70% of the Parisian heatwave deaths attributed to human greenhouse gas emissions;9Mitchell D Heaviside C Vardoulakis S et al.Attributing human mortality during extreme heat waves to anthropogenic climate change.Environ Res Lett. 2016; 11074006Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar yet asking the same question of the 2019 heatwave is less straightforward because the heat–mortality relationship is likely to have changed since countries have put in place better heat-response plans. Establishing the present-day heat-mortality relationship for each city requires daily information on different types of deaths, which is hard to collate on timescales of less than a year. As such, the only heat-related deaths we hear about at the time of the heatwave are those obviously associated with heat, such as those reported to be due to cold shock (a sudden change in heat [eg, from a hot beach to cold sea]) during the 2019 heatwave, or deaths in children left in overheated cars during the Chicago 1995 heat event. Therefore, although the extreme temperatures associated with the 2019 heatwave are tending towards becoming the new normal in terms of summer climate, it is less clear how this change will translate into human health. The deaths reported at the time will be a substantial underestimate of the true number, which will only become apparent in the coming months and years. These under-reported deaths will be mainly from cardiovascular or respiratory failure in older and at-risk populations, and such deaths are harder to immediately attribute to the heat. On the question of how bad this situation could get in the future, all climate models project warming as atmospheric greenhouse gases increase, with mean projected global warming at the end of the century ranging from 2°C to 5°C above preindustrial values.6Stocker TF Qin D Plattner GK et al.Climate change 2013: the physical science basis. Working group I contribution to the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2013: 1535Google Scholar This range is due to a combination of uncertainties in the emissions scenario and in model physics, especially those related to clouds. To elucidate how future climate change under the Paris Agreement might alter a 2019-like heatwave, we evaluated the probability of recurrence of such a heatwave over France using a set of global climate models specifically designed to study extreme weather.10Mitchell D James R Forster PM Betts RA Shiogama H Allen M Realizing the impacts of a 1.5 °C warmer world.Nat Clim Chang. 2016; 6: 735-737Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar The 2019 heatwave is so extreme that our current models could not fully represent the observed temperature magnitude over France under current climate forcing, probably because of a misrepresentation of the soil-moisture feedback, which acts to enhance warming trends, especially in mid-latitude areas such as central Europe.11Seneviratne S Lüthi D Litschi M Schär C Land–atmosphere coupling and climate change in Europe.Nature. 2006; 443: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar Although it is hard to model all the conditions that drove the June 2019 heatwave, the evidence is clear that severe heatwaves will become more frequent as the climate continues to warm.2Stott PA Stone DA Allen MR Human contribution to the European heatwave of 2003.Nature. 2004; 432: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar Future heat-related mortality will depend on country-specific adaptability and mitigation plans, as well as the future emissions scenario; even so, different climate models give different temperature projections, so mortality counts are uncertain.12Guo Y Gasparrini A Li S et al.Quantifying excess deaths related to heatwaves under climate change scenarios: a multicountry time series modelling study.PLoS Med. 2018; 15e1002629Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar Unless we significantly reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, heatwaves will become more extreme in magnitude in the future, and human mortality will increase as a result, unless adequate heat-adaptation plans are put in place.13Lo YTE Mitchell DM Gasparrini A et al.Increasing mitigation ambition to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature goal avoids substantial heat-related mortality in US cities.Sci Adv. 2019; 5eaau4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar The concerns implicit in the literature8Watts N Amann M Ayeb-Karlsson S et al.The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: from 25 years of inaction to a global transformation for public health.Lancet. 2018; 391: 581-630Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar are that incorporation of long-term planning for heatwaves might not be occurring in some countries. Such frustrations to civil preparedness arise because of poor dissemination of climate science findings and inadequate data collection, and, perhaps, because health and climate researchers need to work together more closely, including sharing data.8Watts N Amann M Ayeb-Karlsson S et al.The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: from 25 years of inaction to a global transformation for public health.Lancet. 2018; 391: 581-630Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar Immediately before and during heatwaves, planned responses often seem to be rather last minute or poorly constrained. This situation affirms the need for climate modellers to continue their efforts towards better understanding and predicting heatwaves, with the aim of providing earlier warning, where possible. We strongly recommend that these efforts should occur alongside tighter collaborations with medical practitioners, researchers, and local officials involved in the design of heat-action plans. Despite the record-breaking temperatures of 2019, the total number of heatwave deaths might be lower than those during previous events. If so, this difference will be partly because of the persistence of the heat, but—to give due credit—also down to improved emergency heatwave plans developed in reaction to the 2003 and other disasters. Hospitals in particular should prepare for patients with increased heat stress and associated physiological conditions. Crucially, if correlations between past heatwaves and associated mortality rates based on previous heatwaves predict more deaths than actually occur during 2019, it will provide encouragement that recent heatwave planning has been effective. We declare no competing interests. Record breakersThe last 22 years contain 20 of the warmest (global average) years on record. This trend is powerfully demonstrated by the popular #Showyourstripes initiative. That most of the warmest years have occurred very recently is hardly surprising given that our planet is being heated by increasing amounts of heat trapping CO2 in the atmosphere—primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels. In this context 2019, which has seen a number of record-breaking heatwaves, is displaying exactly the sorts of conditions that we should expect to see more and more often. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "The UN declared 2010, as the International Year of Biodiversity. However, around that time, media outlets and other sources of information revealed that most people do not fully understand what biodiversity is. Public understanding has hopefully improved since 2010. The recent global assessment by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services attracted high levels of media interest in response to their shocking findings; for example, one headline stated that there are 1 million species facing extinction.1Trompiz G Scientists warn a million species at risk of extinction. Reuters, May 6, 2019https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-environment-biodiversity/scientists-warn-a-million-species-at-risk-of-extinction-idUSKCN1SC0PJDate accessed: June 5, 2019Google Scholar Political awareness is increasing as a result of the IPBES report, which states clearly that biodiversity loss is as important an issue for society as climate change.2Watson R Loss of biodiversity just as catastrophic as climate change. The Guardian, May 6, 2019https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/06/biodiversity-climate-change-mass-extinctionsDate accessed: June 5, 2019Google Scholar But there is still much confusion and misperception about biodiversity—what it is, what it does, and why it matters. Perhaps this lack of familiarity accounts for the scarcity of engagement of the development community in debates about biodiversity and how to protect it. It is not that those concerned with development have a blind spot for environmental issues—climate change is a priority on high on the agenda of many development organisations. But they don't seem to fully understand biodiversity. In this comment, I argue that they need to, and quickly. When biodiversity loss is reported in the media, it is most often in the form of emotionally provoking stories about the plight of iconic species such as rhinos, polar bears, tigers, and elephants. It is no surprise then that development professionals—although they might be personally concerned about these issues—do not see the connection between declining biodiversity and their development agenda of poverty alleviation, improvements of health care, gender equality, and resilience to natural disasters, and other important areas social issues. Furthermore, reports of human rights abuses in the name of conservation3Warren T Baker K WWF funds guards who have tortured and killed people. Buzzfeed News.https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tomwarren/wwf-world-wide-fund-nature-parks-torture-deathDate: March 4, 2019Date accessed: June 5, 2019Google Scholar could justifiably persuade the development community that concern for biodiversity can work against their agenda. So, what is biodiversity and why does it really matter to development? The formal definition of biodiversity comes from the UN Convention on Biological Diversity which describes it as \"the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems.\" The key word is variability. Biodiversity is more than an elephant, a herd of elephants, or the entire world population of elephants. It is the diversity of life and the ecological interactions between diverse lifeforms that matters most. Diversity matters because it has a big effect on the productivity and stability of natural ecosystems, and on the services they provide, many of which are important for key development sectors. Crop genetic diversity increases the yield of agricultural crops, tree species diversity enhances wood production in plantations, plant species diversity produces better fodder in grasslands, and fish species diversity is associated with more stable catches.4Cardinale BJ Duffy JE Gonzalez A et al.Biodiversity loss and its impact on humanity.Nature. 2012; 486: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (3892) Google Scholar More diverse systems are also more resilient to climate fluctuations.5Isbell F Craven D Connolly J et al.Biodiversity increases the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate extremes.Nature. 2015; 526: 547-577Crossref Scopus (753) Google Scholar Diversity is not the only important property of natural systems from a development and poverty reduction perspective. Many benefits people, particularly those of a lower socioeconomic background, get from nature are dependent on the abundance of particular species as they are on the species diversity. How well ecosystems provide people with developmental benefits also depends on their condition and extent, and on the specific functions certain species, groups of species, or ecosystems carry out (eg, sources of food, absorbers of air pollution, and natural barriers against storm surges). Crucially, however, diversity underpins the abundance, extent, and condition of nature and ecosystems and is needed to secure the flow of benefits to people in the future, particularly in the face of changing environmental conditions. Biodiversity is about not just the wealth of nature, but also the health of nature. Loss of biodiversity undermines ecosystems' abilities to function effectively and efficiently and thus undermines nature's ability to support a healthy environment. This is particularly important in a changing climate in which loss of biodiversity reduces nature's resilience to change. It is also particularly important for people of a lower socioeconomic background who are more directly dependent on nature than are others, and who will be hit the soonest and hardest because of their existing vulnerability to climate change. Although some loss of biodiversity is normal, the current rate of extinction is unprecedented being up to 1000 times higher than natural background rates.6Brondizio ES, Settele J, Díaz S, Ngo HT Ngo. IPBES global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Intergovernmental Science–Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.

In 2020, the international community will agree on a new 10-year framework for biodiversity management. Developing this new framework into one that works for both biodiversity and for people requires active engagement by the development community, and there are some actions that could be taken to enable this. First, nature-proofing development interventions. For many years now, development professionals have recognised the need to climate-proof their investments. Similarly, they should understand the risks of biodiversity loss and build biodiversity safeguards into development interventions, particularly investments in infrastructure, extractive industries, large-scale agriculture, and tourism. Second, recognition and investment in biodiversity for development and climate change resilience. As well as avoiding undermining biodiversity, we need to invest in ways that maximise its potential. Biodiversity directly supports export earnings, gross domestic product, and jobs in a wide variety of economic sectors from tourism to agriculture, and it therefore needs to be sustainably managed for these sectors to successfully grow. There is increasing international interest in nature-based solutions to development and climate change challenges, but these need to emphasis diverse nature over monocultures. For example, large-scale afforestation programmes on the Loess Plateau in China have involved plantations of single, non-native species, which have been effective at reducing soil erosion but compromised water supplies for agriculture and domestic use and have brought fewer ecosystem services overall than have areas where natural vegetation has been allowed to regrow.8Jiao J Zhang ZG Bai WJ et al.Assessing the ecological success of restoration by afforestation on the Chinese Loess Plateau.Restoration Ecology. 2012; 20: 240-249Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar Last, engagement with the conservation sector. It is crucial that the development community challenges interventions that might disadvantage people of a lower socioeconomic background—such as militarised conservation or exclusionary protected areas—and encourage those that focus on components of biodiversity that are particularly important to these people, including plant and animal species for food, medicines, and income. In 2020, biodiversity is as much a development priority as is the climate change emergency and therefore needs much more proactive engagement and response from the development community.

Although air pollution is a universal issue, it is likely to cause the greatest harm in susceptible individuals who are exposed to high PM2·5 concentrations. People with chronic diseases (particularly cardiorespiratory illnesses), little social support, and poor access to medical services are most at risk from air pollution. China is the largest developing country in the world, with exceptional economic growth observed in the past four decades.4Economy watchChina Economy.http://www.economywatch.com/world_economy/china/Date: 2013Date accessed: November 25, 2018Google Scholar However, similar to other rapidly industrialising countries, air pollution, water contamination, and land degradation are serious environmental issues in China, and thus are the focus of a considerable amount of research and public attention.5Zhang K Dearing J Tong S Hughes T China's degraded environment enters a new normal.Trends Ecol Evol. 2016; 31: 175-177Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar To protect the environment and public health, policies have been established to tackle air pollution and other environmental problems.

However, little data are available on the public health benefits of air pollution control measures and policies in developing countries. This issue is important since the disease burden associated with air pollution has increased in the past decade, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.3Cohen AJ Brauer M Burnett R et al.Estimates and 25-year trends of the global burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution: an analysis of data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1907-1918Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar The modelling study by Qing Wang and colleagues in The Lancet Planetary Health10Wang Q Wang J Zhou J Ban J Li T Estimation of PM2.5-associated disease burden in China in 2020 and 2030 using population and air quality scenarios: a modelling study.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: 71-80Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar provides important information with regard to the health benefits of air quality improvements in China. The authors used county-level PM2·5 and mortality data to estimate PM2·5-associated disease burden in 2020 and 2030. Wang and colleagues reported that the projected health benefit of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan is considerable, and could reduce the number of PM2·5-related premature deaths by 129 278 deaths (13·5%) in 2020 and by 217 988 deaths (22·8%) in 2030 compared with 2010. However, the health benefits resulting from air quality improvements would be offset by the effect of the population growth and ageing. Thus, to reduce future disease burden, the implementation of more stringent measures for air quality improvement and public health protection are needed in China. Concerted efforts are needed to cope with population growth and ageing. The authors estimated the future disease burden in China at the county level, with full coverage of the entire country for multiple scenarios. Future efforts should use the county-level age structure and the baseline mortality of diseases to project the health benefits associated with air quality improvements. As discussed by the authors, no data on future age structure (county or provincial level) or future baseline mortality (county or provincial level) of each disease were available, which is an important limitation of the study since baseline mortality is likely to decline over time and the pace of population ageing might vary between counties. The authors' assumption that for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, the relative risk (RR) for the same exposure concentration of PM2·5 was the same for all adults might be incorrect. Previous studies11Zhang S Li G Tian L et al.Short-term exposure to air pollution and morbidity of COPD and asthma in East Asian area: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Environ Res. 2016; 148: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Fougère B Landkocz Y Lepers C et al.Influence of aging in the modulation of epigenetic biomarkers of carcinogenesis after exposure to air pollution.Exp Gerontol. 2018; 110: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar have shown that the associated with air pollution for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer varies with age, and these results are biologically plausible. Additionally, the difference in risk across age groups is exacerbated by the fact that the population is rapidly ageing in China, and the incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer is likely to be higher in older populations (aged >55 years) than younger populations (aged <55 years). Thus, this modelling approach requires improvement for future projections. Quantifying and projecting the health benefits induced by air quality improvements is complex, and requires consideration of differences that might exist between counties as suggested by Wang and colleagues. An urgent need exists to identify the characteristics of future disease burden associated with air pollution, including the changing patterns of disease, spatial distributions, at-risk populations, most sensitive diseases, and the optimum model to use for such projections. This study highlights the need to formulate and implement more stringent environmental policies and public health measures in China to control air pollution in the future. These policy implications are applicable to other developing countries with similar levels of air pollution and similar population demographics. I declare no competing interests. Estimation of PM2·5-associated disease burden in China in 2020 and 2030 using population and air quality scenarios: a modelling studyTo reduce the future disease burden in China, targets that are stricter than the interim target and stringent policies to improve air quality and protect public health are needed, especially for at-risk population groups, such as older individuals (aged >55 years) and patients with cardiovascular diseases, particularly in regions with a high disease burden.

    "ab": "BackgroundIn the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, rapid and spontaneous scale-up of window screening occurred through purely horizontal commercial distribution systems without any public subsidies or promotion. Scale-up of window screening coincided with a planned evaluation of programmatic, vertically managed scale-up of regular larvicide application as an intervention against malaria vectors and transmission. We aimed to establish whether scale-up of window screening was associated with suppression of mosquito populations, especially for malaria vectors that strongly prefer humans as their source of blood.MethodsThis study was a re-analysis of a previous observational series of epidemiological data plus new analyses of previously partly reported complementary entomological data, from Dar es Salaam. Between 2004 and 2008, six rounds of cluster-sampled, rolling, cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire surveys were done in urban Dar es Salaam to assess the effect of larviciding and other determinants of malaria risk, such as use of bed nets and antimalarial drugs, socioeconomic status, age, sex, travel history, mosquito-proofed housing, and spending time outdoors. The effects of scaled-up larvicide application and window screening were estimated by fitting generalised linear mixed models that allowed for both spatial variation between survey locations and temporal autocorrelation within locations. We also conducted continuous longitudinal entomological surveys of outdoor human biting rates by mosquitoes and experimental measurements of mosquito host preferences.FindingsBest-fit models of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection prevalence among humans were largely consistent with the results of the previous analyses. Re-analysis of previously reported epidemiological data revealed that most of the empirically fitted downward time trend in P falciparum malaria prevalence over the course of the study (odds ratio [OR] 0·04; 95% CI 0·03–0·06; p<0·0001), which was not previously reported numerically or attributed to any explanatory factor, could be plausibly explained by association with an upward trend in city-wide window screening coverage (OR 0·07; 0·05–0·09; p<0·0001) and progressive rollout of larviciding (OR 0·50; 0·41–0·60; p<0·0001). Increasing coverage of complete window screening was also associated with reduced biting densities of all taxonomic groups of mosquitoes (all p<0·0001), especially the Anopheles gambiae complex (relative rate [RR] 0·23; 95% CI 0·16–0·33) and Anopheles funestus group (RR 0·08; 0·04–0·16), which were confirmed as the most efficient vectors of malaria with strong preferences for humans over cattle. Larviciding was also associated with reduced biting densities of all mosquito taxa (p<0·0001), to an extent that varied consistently with the larvicide targeting scheme and known larval ecology of each taxon.InterpretationCommunity-wide mosquito proofing of houses might deliver greater impacts on vector populations and malaria transmission than previously thought. The spontaneous nature of the scale-up observed here is also encouraging with regards to practicality, acceptability, and affordability in low-income settings.FundingUnited States Agency for International Development, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, and Valent BioSciences LLC.",

    "ab": "BackgroundFlavonoids, compounds found in plant-based foods and beverages, might ameliorate vascular damage and atherosclerosis. Therefore, our aim was to assess the association between flavonoid intake and hospital admissions due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.MethodsIn this prospective cohort study, participants from the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study were cross-linked with Danish nationwide registries. Eligible participants were aged 50–65 years, had no previous history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and had completed a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline. We examined associations between flavonoid intake (calculated from food-frequency questionnaires with use of the Phenol-Explorer database) and hospital admissions for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. We obtained hazard ratios (HRs) using restricted cubic splines based on Cox proportional hazards models.FindingsOf the participants recruited to the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health study between 1993 and 1997, our study population was comprised of 53 552 participants, with a median follow-up of 21 years (IQR 15–22). During follow-up, 8773 participants were admitted to hospital for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We observed non-linear associations between flavonoid intake and hospital admissions, plateauing at total flavonoid intakes of approximately 1000 mg per day. Compared with an intake of 175 mg per day, an intake of 1000 mg per day was associated with a 14% lower risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HR 0·86, 95% CI 0·81–0·91). For disease subtypes, we observed a 9% lower risk of ischaemic heart disease (0·91, 0·85–0·98), a non-significant 9% lower risk of ischaemic stroke (0·91, 0·82–1·01), and a 32% lower risk of peripheral artery disease (0·68, 0·60–0·78). The overall associations were stronger in smokers than in non-smokers, as well as stronger in consumers of high (>20 g per day) quantities of alcohol than in those consuming low-to-moderate (≤20 g per day) quantities.InterpretationOur results suggest that ensuring an adequate consumption of flavonoid-rich foods, particularly in subpopulations at risk of atherosclerosis such as smokers and consumers of high quantities of alcohol might mitigate some of the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. More studies are needed to support and validate these data.FundingDanish Cancer Society.",

However, currently, it remains uncertain what transformative WaSH entails. We hypothesise that exposure to animal faeces is currently an under-recognised threat to human health. Estimates published in 2018 have highlighted the scale of animal faecal hazards,5Berendes DM Yang PJ Lai A Hu D Brown J Estimation of global recoverable human and animal faecal biomass.Nat Sustain. 2018; 1: 679-685Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar which are not explicitly addressed by conventional WaSH strategies. Globally, 80% of the faecal load is estimated to come from livestock animals, including two-thirds of faeces at the household level.5Berendes DM Yang PJ Lai A Hu D Brown J Estimation of global recoverable human and animal faecal biomass.Nat Sustain. 2018; 1: 679-685Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar Research addressing the effect of domestic and wild animal faeces on WaSH effectiveness is scarce6Matilla F Velleman Y Harrison W Nevel M Animal influence on water, sanitation and hygiene measures for zoonosis control at the household level: a systematic literature review.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2018; 12e006619Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 7Penakalapati G Swarthout J Delahoy MJ et al.Exposure to animal feces and human health: a systematic review and proposed research priorities.Environ Sci Technol. 2017; 51: 11537-11552Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and collaboration between the WaSH, public health, and animal health sectors in LMICs insufficient.6Matilla F Velleman Y Harrison W Nevel M Animal influence on water, sanitation and hygiene measures for zoonosis control at the household level: a systematic literature review.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2018; 12e006619Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar As an interdisciplinary group of researchers, policy makers, and practitioners in One Health, epidemiology, veterinary medicine, child health, nutrition, microbiology, geography, social science, WaSH, and animal ecology, we met (on May 22–23, 2019) to focus attention on the neglected burden of domestic and wild animal faecal exposure among rural households in LMICs. We contend that without adding safe management of animal faeces to current programmes focused solely on human waste, rural WaSH programmes will insufficiently reduce faecal exposure from all sources to the extent needed to improve child health. To emphasise this, we propose a paradigm shift in WaSH terminology, by upgrading the currently diminutive and redundant \"a\" to \"A\"—Water, Animals, Sanitation, and Hygiene—highlighting that reducing exposure to animals and their faeces also needs to be central to WASH approaches. Current programmes focus on containment of human faeces and so do not avert two-thirds of potential faecal hazards,5Berendes DM Yang PJ Lai A Hu D Brown J Estimation of global recoverable human and animal faecal biomass.Nat Sustain. 2018; 1: 679-685Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar meaning they are unlikely to achieve the large-scale reductions in microbial exposure that we believe are necessary.4Pickering AJ Null C Winch PJ et al.The WASH Benefits and SHINE trials: interpretation of WASH intervention effects on linear growth and diarrhoea.Lancet Glob Health. 2019; 7: e1139-e1146Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar There are many unknowns in how to best maximise the benefits and minimise the risks of animal ownership.7Penakalapati G Swarthout J Delahoy MJ et al.Exposure to animal feces and human health: a systematic review and proposed research priorities.Environ Sci Technol. 2017; 51: 11537-11552Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar Livestock are crucial to rural livelihoods, contributing to household economic and sociocultural wellbeing, and providing animal-source foods, transport, and manure for fertiliser and fuel. However, the message that animal faeces should be considered potentially hazardous, just as human faeces are, needs to be central to WASH programming, with safe management of animal faeces added to the global WASH agenda. Although some trials have attempted to reduce zoonotic transmission of enteropathogens by providing tools to separate livestock from children,3Humphrey JH Mbuya MNN Ntozini R et al.Independent and combined effects of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene, and improved complementary feeding, on child stunting and anaemia in rural Zimbabwe: a cluster-randomised trial.Lancet Glob Health. 2019; 7: e132-e147Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8The US Government's Global Hunger & Food Security InitiativeCaged: Campylobacter genomics and environmental enteric dysfunction.http://livestocklab.ifas.ufl.edu/projects/caged-project/Date: 2019Date accessed: July 31, 2019Google Scholar, 9Gelli A Becquey E Ganaba R et al.Improving diets and nutrition through an integrated poultry value chain and nutrition intervention (SELEVER) in Burkina Faso: a study protocol for a randomized trial.Trials. 2017; 18: 412Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar this approach is not always feasible, financially viable (eg, penned chickens require feeding), beneficial to animal health and welfare, or viewed favourably by local community members. Instead, we argue for a more holistic One Health approach to WASH, which considers the interconnection between the health of people, animals, and our shared environment. A One Health approach encourages collaboration across multiple disciplines and sectors with the ultimate goal of achieving optimal health outcomes for all, rather than a singular focus on human health as the endpoint. This approach would provide an opportunity to devise and test integrated programmes that are mindful of the numerous competing and interdependent priorities for households, while considering livestock production, welfare, and social value; soil health and crop yields; and water and air quality, in addition to human health. Indeed, such a comprehensive approach might yield greater gains to all sectors than individually focused projects alone. Negative trial results,1Luby SP Rahman M Arnold BF et al.Effects of water quality, sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions on diarrhoea and child growth in rural Bangladesh: a cluster randomised controlled trial.Lancet Glob Health. 2018; 6: e302-e315Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 2Null C Stewart CP Pickering AJ et al.Effects of water quality, sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions on diarrhoea and child growth in rural Kenya: a cluster-randomised controlled trial.Lancet Glob Health. 2018; 6: e316-e329Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 3Humphrey JH Mbuya MNN Ntozini R et al.Independent and combined effects of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene, and improved complementary feeding, on child stunting and anaemia in rural Zimbabwe: a cluster-randomised trial.Lancet Glob Health. 2019; 7: e132-e147Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar published in 2018 and 2019, from conventional WaSH interventions indicate that it has never been more important to seek transformative, community-driven, integrated approaches.4Pickering AJ Null C Winch PJ et al.The WASH Benefits and SHINE trials: interpretation of WASH intervention effects on linear growth and diarrhoea.Lancet Glob Health. 2019; 7: e1139-e1146Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar The first step—putting the \"A\" into WASH—is to shift the thinking to accelerate progress towards transformative WASH by considering pathways of enteropathogen transmission that are not currently central to WaSH strategies. We believe more substantial reductions in household and environmental faecal contamination are possible through concerted efforts to collectively improve the health of animals, humans, and the environment, while maintaining the benefits of livestock ownership. There is a pressing need to test new intervention approaches that will tackle all household faecal exposure through a combined focus on Water, Animals, Sanitation, and Hygiene to yield greater gains from WASH.

    "ab": "BackgroundPoor sanitation in peri-urban areas is a growing public health problem. We tested a scalable, demand-side behaviour change intervention to motivate landlords to improve the quality of shared toilets within their plots.MethodsWe did a residential plot-randomised controlled trial in a peri-urban community in Lusaka, Zambia. We enrolled adult resident landlords on plots where at least one tenant lived. We allocated landlords 1:1 to intervention and control arms on the basis of a random number sequence. The intervention was developed using the Behaviour Centred Design approach and consisted of a series of group meetings designed to motivate sanitation quality improvement as a way to build wealth and reduce on-plot conflict; no subsidies or materials were provided. The control group received no intervention. The four primary outcomes were having a rotational cleaning system in place (to improve hygiene); having a solid door on the toilet used by tenants with an inside lock (for privacy); having an outside lock (for security); and having a sealed toilet (to reduce smell and contamination). We measured outcomes 1 month before the start of the intervention and 4 months after the end of the intervention. Data collectors measuring outcomes were blinded to group assignment. We analysed outcomes by intention to treat, including all landlords with study-end results. Because the outcomes were assumed to not be independent, we used a family-wise error rate of 0·05 to calculate an adjusted significance level of 0·0253. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03174015.FindingsBetween June 9 and July 6, 2017, 1085 landlords were enrolled and randomly assigned to the intervention (n=543) or the control group (n=542). The intervention was delivered from Aug 1, 2017, and evaluated from Feb 15 to March 5, 2018. Analysis was based on the 474 intervention and 454 control landlords surveyed at study end. The intervention was associated with improvements in the prevalence of cleaning rotas (relative risk 1·16, 95% CI 1·05–1·30; p=0·0011), inside locks (1·34, 1·10–1·64; p=0·00081), outside locks (1·27, 1·06–1·52; p=0·0028), and toilets with simple covers or water seals (1·25, 1·04–1·50; p=0·0063).InterpretationIt is possible to improve the structural quality and cleanliness of shared sanitation by targeting landlords with a scalable, theory-driven behaviour change intervention without subsidy or provision of the relevant infrastructure.FundingSanitation and Hygiene Applied Research for Equity.",

    "ab": "Migration is transformative both for those who move and for the places and economies of source and destination. The global stock of migrants, depending on definition, is approximately 750 million people: to assume that the world is static and that migration is a problem to be managed is inaccurate. Since migration is a major driving force of planetary and population health, we argue that it must be more directly incorporated into planning for sustainable development, with a focus on the extent and way in which the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) incorporate the transformative reality of migration. The science of migration explains social and demographic dynamics, with human mobility as the norm rather than as a discrete event.1Heller M Urry J The new mobilities paradigm.Environ Plann A. 2006; 38: 207-226Crossref Scopus (3420) Google Scholar Flows of ideas, remittances, and social capital from migration, for example, play a central role in transforming economic as well as social and political life in places of origin and destination. Migration is, therefore, an intrinsic part of social transformation2De Haas H Migration and development: a theoretical perspective.Int Migr Rev. 2010; 44: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar that occurs in parallel and in combination with other societal trends, including many that are the explicit focus of the SDGs. Migration processes can have positive and negative effects on social transformation.3Massey DS Social structure, household strategies, and the cumulative causation of migration.Popul Index. 1990; 56: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar There are widespread concerns, for example, regarding the effect of rapid urbanisation driven by migration on the sustainable use of resources in cities. However, migrant populations have been shown throughout the world to be on average healthier and more economically active than host populations, at least with current migration patterns.4Hunter LM Simon DH Might climate change the \"healthy migrant\" effect?.Glob Environ Change. 2017; 47: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar From an economic perspective, migration is often a driver of economic growth: whether economic growth is itself sustainable thus becomes the key question. The discourse of migration in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reflects the global political tensions surrounding the issue of migration at the time of its negotiations, culminating in 2015, when many countries, particularly in Europe, experienced major influxes of refugees from Syria and other conflict-affected countries.5Nijenhuis G Leung M Rethinking migration in the 2030 Agenda: towards a de-territorialized conceptualization of development.Forum Dev Stud. 2017; 44: 51-68Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6Holliday J Hennebry J Gammage S Achieving the sustainable development goals: surfacing the role for a gender analytic of migration.J Ethn Migr Stud. 2019; 45: 2551-2565Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar In effect, the 2030 Agenda frames migration as a temporary and unplanned phenomenon that needs to be managed, rather than as an inherent and longstanding part of sustainable development and social transformation. The table documents how sedentary framing of development leads to the relevant current goals, targets, and indicators within the SDGs.TableFraming of migration in the 2030 Agenda, with relevant goals, targets, and indicatorsTargets and indicatorsRelevant insights from migration scienceMigration as temporaryGoal 10: Reduced inequalitiesArticle 29: underlines the rights of migrants to return to their country of origin.Indicator 10.7.2: migration policies that facilitate \"orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people\".

For example: i) movement to urban areas increases pressure on urban infrastructure and governance; ii) permanent displacement and relocation of populations from places at risk, including from small island developing states. Open table in a new tab Within the SDGs, migration is recognised as a \"multidimensional reality\" that is of \"major relevance for the development of countries of origin, transit and destination\" (2030 Agenda, article 29). Migrants are acknowledged as able to make a \"positive contribution\" to inclusive growth (article 29), but the SDGs seem to refer mostly to benefits in the country of origin in the form of remittances from international labour migrants. Remittances, indeed, play a crucial economic role in countries with high international outmigration, but with significant social consequences such as so-called brain drain effects. Overall, the 2030 Agenda, and specifically the SDGs on sustainable cities and climate action, have a static concept of human populations, de-emphasising permanent and temporary migration as a key aspect of sustainable development, climate resilience, and social transformation. Where migration is considered to \"threaten to reverse much of the development progress\", the 2030 Agenda focuses on the \"eradication\" of human trafficking (article 27, and targets 5.2, 8.7, and 16.2), as well as \"temporary\" stays of forcibly displaced people (indicator 10.7.2). Such a framing of climate migration fails to consider migration as a long-term contribution to climate resilience and adaptation.7Gemenne F Blocher J How can migration serve adaptation to climate change? Challenges to fleshing out a policy ideal.Geogr J. 2017; 183: 336-347Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar Incorporating realistic scientific insights on migration and mobility would, we suggest, identify the conditions under which migration could contribute to positive outcomes for many arenas of sustainability, from disaster preparedness, to health and nutrition, and to safe and sustainable cities. SDG 11 seeks to promote safe, sustainable, and resilient cities, for example, but its indicators need to reflect the reality of how urbanisation is driven by population movement to cities. A target of SDG 11 is to minimise the \"proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing\". However, the persistence of slum areas is driven by continued movement of new migrants to cities. In many cities in developing countries, more than half of residents are lifetime migrants. Migrant populations cluster in areas that are exposed to environmental hazards and have been shown to have uneven access to public health and other services and discriminated in labour markets.8Black R Bennett SR Thomas SM Beddington JR Climate change: Migration as adaptation.Nature. 2011; 478: 447-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar Therefore, the realisation of urban sustainability is intimately tied to the effectiveness and rapidity of integration of new populations into urban planning. SDG 13 on climate action does not make an explicit connection between nations most vulnerable to climate change and increased migration flows, and thus underplays the opportunity to protect or acknowledge the adaptive role played by mobile populations. More than 25 million people per year are displaced internally or internationally by weather-related disasters. Involuntary and forced migration, not least through climate change, represents a breach of rights and is likely to have significant detrimental health outcomes.9McMichael C Barnett J McMichael AJ An ill wind? Climate change, migration, and health.Environ Health Perspect. 2012; 120: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Levy BS Patz JA Climate change, human rights, and social justice.Ann Glob Health. 2015; 81: 310-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar It has been shown in diverse settings that migrants contribute by filling key skill gaps, increase the consumption and production of goods and services, and improve local labour market efficiency, particularly in times of crisis or disaster. Migrants also support the resilience and wellbeing of origin communities through financial and social remittances. Rather than harnessing the potential of such interactions, the state-oriented nature of the targets and current indicators associated with SDG 13 implicitly sidesteps migration. Incorporating the potentially social transformative nature of migration into policy and planning for sustainable development would better reflect the reality of a mobile world. A more encompassing view of migration would, we argue, lead to more appropriate targets and indicators for the SDGs. For example, target indicators could, for SDG 11 on urban areas, include the number of migrants entering informal economic sectors: such migration is most often associated with discrimination and precarity in cities. Additionally, SDG 13 on climate action could monitor regulations across countries for government-led relocation of communities (such relocation is likely to become more widespread into the future). A comprehensive set of targets and indicators would present better opportunities to deal with pressing challenges of social transformations, including ageing populations and declining birth rates in many countries. In summary, the SDGs need to move beyond the implicit assumption that sedentary lives are the norm and that it is only safe, orderly, and regular migration that contributes to sustainable development. We suggest that, when migration is incorporated as an inherent and continuing part of social transformations, it will become central to long-term climate resilience and adaptation.

We determined factors accounting for variations in cardiovascular risk factors among First Nations communities in Canada. <h3>Methods<\/h3> Men and women (n=1302) aged 18 years or older from eight First Nations communities participated in a population-based study. Questionnaires, physical measures, blood samples, MRI of preclinical vascular disease, and community audits were collected. In this cross-sectional analysis, the main outcome was the INTERHEART risk score, a measure of cardiovascular risk factor burden. A multivariable model was developed to explain the variations in INTERHEART risk score among communities. The secondary outcome was MRI-detected carotid wall volume, a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. <h3>Findings<\/h3> The mean INTERHEART risk score of all communities was 17·2 (SE 0·2), and more than 85% of individuals had a risk score in the moderate to high risk range. Subclinical atherosclerosis increased significantly across risk score categories (p<0·0001). Socioeconomic advantage (–1·4 score, 95% CI −2·5 to −0·3; p=0·01), trust between neighbours (–0·7, −1·2 to −0·3; p=0·003), higher education level (–1·9, −2·9 to −0·8, p<0·001), and higher social support (–1·1, −2·0 to −0·2; p=0·02) were independently associated with a lower INTERHEART risk score; difficulty accessing routine health care (2·2, 0·3 to 4·1, p=0·02), taking prescription medication (3·5, 2·8 to 4·3; p<0·001), and inability to afford prescription medications (1·5, 0·5 to 2·6; p=0·003) were associated with a higher INTERHEART risk score. Collectively, these factors explained 28% variation in the cardiac risk score among communities. Communities with higher socioeconomic advantage and greater trust, and individuals with higher education and social support, had a lower INTERHEART risk score. Communities with difficulty accessing health care, and individuals taking or unable to afford prescription medications, had a higher INTERHEART risk score. <h3>Interpretation<\/h3> Cardiac risk factors are lower in communities with high socioeconomic advantage, greater trust, social support and educational opportunities, and higher where it is difficult to access health care or afford prescription medications. Strategies to optimise the protective factors and reduce barriers to health care in First Nations communities might contribute to improved health and wellbeing. <h3>Funding<\/h3> Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, Canadian Institutes for Health Research.",

    "ab": "The Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on planetary health1Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 368: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1122) Google Scholar in 2015 argued that although human health has improved dramatically between 1950 and 2010, this gain was accompanied by unprecedented environmental degradation that now threatens both human health and life-support systems. The sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6)—Healthy Planet, Healthy People—a report adopted by 193 countries in March, 2019, reinforces this message by showing how the state of the environment has further deteriorated with increasing consequences for human health. GEO-6 goes beyond single-issue assessments (eg, climate change [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], biodiversity [Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services], and ocean health [Ocean Health Index]) and health assessments of specific risks to assess the state of the environment, policies, and outlooks for the future in an 800-page report (assessing more than 3880 sources). The report is a product of 146 authors, with input from a High-Level Intergovernmental and Stakeholder Advisory Group, a Scientific Advisory Panel, and an Assessment Methodology Group and has been subject to 14 388 review comments by 1370 reviewers. Here, we integrate and focus this information to convey the subtitle of the report: Healthy Planet, Healthy People (figure). GEO-6 assesses the different earth system components (air, land, freshwater, oceans, and biodiversity) but considers each separately. Here, we integrate knowledge on the health of the planet and humans across these components and rank the impacts. First, we build on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, which present the goals as linked and indivisible from the underlying system components and requires that no one be left behind and that the furthest behind should be prioritised. Second, we rank the damage to these components from 1–5 (worst to least affected) taking a medium-term (years 2018–50) perspective locally through to globally, focusing on reversibility of the damage—ie, can a system recover by 2050 if action is taken now? If a system cannot easily recover, its ability to flourish and contribute to human wellbeing in the future is reduced. Third, we rank consequent harm to human health and wellbeing from 1–5 (worst to least affected) directly (eg, non-communicable or infectious diseases via unclean air and water), but also indirectly (eg, through effects on food and livelihoods). Because of data limitations, we focus on mortality and morbidity; to a limited extent we take displacement, with loss of lives, livelihoods, and homes as a proxy for the loss of wellbeing. We emphasise the furthest behind first notion by accounting for local effects. About 70% of the world's poorest people depend directly on ecosystem services for their survival; hence, the disruption of ecosystem services disproportionately affects their wellbeing, and this information is inadequately captured in national economic indicators. We conclude that biodiversity is the worst affected component, followed by air, oceans, freshwater, and land (figure; appendix). The irreversibility of biodiversity loss (from genes to ecosystems, including, for example, pollinators) at all levels reflects an ongoing major extinction event.2Ceballos G Ehrlich PR Dirzo R Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2017; 114: E6089-E6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar These losses are exacerbated by the spread of invasive species and the rising illegal trade in wildlife, timber, and fisheries. The impacts on air, including climate change, are ranked second, because global warming has already exceeded 0·8–0·9°C in relation to preindustrial levels and the 1·5°C mark will be crossed in the 2030s if policies are not drastically changed and new technologies implemented.3Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeGlobal warming of 1·5°C.

Severe household air pollution occurs in low-income homes of the global south, but is also reversible. The impact on the oceans ranks third because the oceans are severely affected by melting sea ice (resulting in sea level rise), increasing water temperatures (affecting global weather patterns), biodiversity loss and loss of fish stocks, coral bleaching events, low-oxygen zones, and increasing chemical and plastic pollution. Effects on freshwater health are ranked fourth and include climate change (changing rainfall patterns and melting glaciers), groundwater pumping beyond recharge levels, chemical and waste pollution (antimicrobial compounds, endocrine disruptors, microplastics and nanoplastics, and nutrients), and biological pollution (spread of pathogens). Finally, ranked fifth, the health of land is affected through land degradation, transformation, and chemical and waste pollution. The costs of the degrading health of land is estimated at US$20 trillion per year.5Nkonya E Mirzabaev A Von Braun J Economics of land degradation and improvement—a global assessment for sustainable development. Springer, Cham2016Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar Most of the effects on oceans and land and many of the effects on freshwater are only partly reversible. Impacts on the different system components act in synergistic ways, creating feedback and cascading effects on other components. These interactions might push the Earth system towards multiple tipping points through which planetary health deteriorates with increasing speed. A healthy planet was conservatively valued at $125 trillion annually in 2007,6Costanza R de Groot R Sutton P et al.Changes in the global value of ecosystem services.Glob Environ Change. 2014; 26: 152-158Crossref Scopus (3137) Google Scholar several times greater than annual global GDP at that time. The consequences for human health of crossing planetary tipping points are immense (figure; appendix). We rank the impacts on human health as being worst for air, then freshwater, biodiversity, oceans, and land. Outdoor and indoor air pollution is the biggest environmental public health risk, causing 6–7 million premature deaths annually7GBD 2016 Risk Factor CollaboratorsGlobal, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016.Lancet. 2017; 390: 1345-1422Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar and about $5 trillion in welfare losses. These impacts are followed by the health effects of freshwater in terms of water scarcity and the effects of disasters (both slow onset and sudden floods), which have displaced three times as many people as conflict. For example, in 2016, 24·2 million people were displaced in 118 countries by water-related disasters whereas 6·9 million were affected by conflict and violence.8Internal Displacement Monitoring CentreGRID 2018.

Ranked third, biodiversity loss reduces adaptive potential to global change and the loss of species (eg, pollinators) and ecosystem degradation is affecting food security, decreasing income, and increasing the spread of zoonotic disease, which accounts for 60% of all infectious disease. Potential economic costs are large, with the value of pollinator services alone estimated at $200 billion annually. Fourth, the risks associated with unhealthy coasts and oceans include loss of employment and sustainable livelihoods for more than 1 billion people and food insecurity for 3·1 billion people who depend on fish for food. Coral reefs and fisheries provide services valued annually at approximately $29 billion (coral reefs) and $253 billion (fisheries), with the fishing industry employing 58–120 million people.9UN.

New York: United Nations, 2016.Google Scholar Sea level rise might present an existential threat to coastal inhabitants, affecting livelihoods and displacing people. Fifth, land degradation and chemical pollution are affecting 3·2 billion people globally in terms of reduced food security, loss of livelihoods and displacement, and disease outbreaks which, when coupled with monocropping, can affect food production. Simplifying knowledge in the way we have here has limitations. It cannot reflect the systemic links between ecosystems and planetary cycles; compartmentalising climate change under the category of air and ranking contextual health effects raises questions; and including populations who are the so-called furthest behind is problematic because available supporting data is scarce and major gaps in knowledge exist. The health ranking is a snapshot and might change (eg, air pollution is largely reversible). Finally, our focus on medium-term irreversibility does not imply that nothing can be done, but calls for urgent action. Investing in the environment generates benefits for human health and the economy. Policymakers must use GEO-6 and other evidence-based scientific reports to fundamentally change the pathway of human economic and social development towards ensuring a healthier planet and healthier people.

Between 2017 and 2018, over 68 million children aged 9 months to 15 years were targeted for MR immunisation, with the country committed to eliminating measles and controlling rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) by 2020.1WHOStrategic plan for measles elimination and rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control in the South-East Asia region 2014–2020.

The first phase in 2017 was a major success, with over 35 million children vaccinated on the main island of Java. With coverage nearing 100%, measles cases dropped sharply.3WHODistribution of measles cases by country and by month, 2011–2018.http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/surveillance_type/active/measles_monthlydata/en/Date accessed: November 13, 2018Google Scholar Targeting 32 million children across 28 provinces, the second phase of the campaign, which launched in August, 2018, has been marred by challenges. A recent outbreak of vaccine-derived polio in Papua New Guinea has required the bundling of oral polio vaccine with MR in adjoining Papua, posing added logistical challenges in Indonesia's most remote province. An earthquake in Lombok in August, 2018, and a tsunami in Sulawesi in September, 2018, contributed to local interruptions. And in the initial weeks of the 2018 campaign, some important Muslim groups withdrew support, leading to suspensions in dozens of districts. The campaign, originally planned for 2 months, has twice been extended to a 5-month horizon to reach the 95% target. Resumption has been particularly slow on the conservative and highly populated island of Sumatra, home to two-thirds of unvaccinated children, with coverage as low as 10% in one province. As the campaign ends, nearly 10 million children remain unimmunised. Concerns exist regarding the potential fallout for routine immunisation, which would confound Indonesia's impressive reductions in child mortality. Indonesia has not turned away from its investment. The government and partners are working to ensure parents are informed by influencers, including religious leaders, that childhood vaccination is their duty and the right of every child. Videos featuring Indonesia's Muslim leaders have been recorded to persuade parents of the importance immunisation. However, addressing concerns requires careful, nuanced, and sustained communication from the right influencers before trust can be regained. Vaccine hesitancy is on the rise globally6Coombes R Europe steps up action against vaccine hesitancy as measles outbreaks continue.BMJ. 2017; 359: j4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and Indonesia's experience is cautionary. Political leaders and health ministries must continue dialogue with religious scholars and communities to generate both a common understanding and unambiguous messaging regarding the benefits of immunisation. Leadership from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation is important. More data are needed to understand the interplay between religion, politics, personal beliefs, and economics that influence individual and community decisions around vaccination. Additional resources and capacity are needed to ensure that the best practice from behavioural science underpin local engagement strategies.

    "ab": "The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment, released in 2019,1Díaz S Settele J Brondízio E et al.Summary for policymakers of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. 2019.https://www.ipbes.net/system/tdf/ipbes_7_10_add-1-_advance_0.pdf?file=1&type=node&id=35245Google Scholar identified invasive alien species, those introduced by humans into regions beyond their natural distributions, as one of the five top direct drivers of biodiversity loss.2Seebens H Blackburn TM Dyer EE et al.No saturation in the accumulation of alien species worldwide.Nat Commun. 2017; 8: 14435Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar Although many cases exist of positive adaptations to the introduction of invasive alien species, they are generally regarded as a severe threat to local ecosystems, wildlife, and human health and overall wellbeing. Once established, efforts to eradicate invasive alien species can raise both public health and ethical concerns because of the unintended effects that control measures can have on the environment and human livelihoods (eg, chemical control and biocontrol agents). Unfortunately, invasive alien species are widespread across all biomes and geographical regions. These species can be considered as an evolving global health threat and are changing the socio-ecological context in which billions of people live, lowering natural resilience to other perturbations and reshaping local ecology. Indeed, we can plausibly argue that invasive alien species are one of the main signposts of the Anthropocene era. Although they can also, in specific cases, be a source of societal benefits, the costs of invasive alien species are tremendous: massive losses in agricultural production and related threats to food security; direct and indirect effects on human health through the spread of pathogens, including newly emerging infectious diseases; and cultural loss, as invasive alien species destroy native flora and fauna that has shaped generations of local knowledge, contributing to the process of biocultural homogenisation. On the effect of invasive alien species on disease alone, our knowledge is vast and growing. For example, the invasion of dense stands of lantana (Lantana camara) in East Africa has provided new habitat for the tsetse fly (Glossina spp), which is a carrier of sleeping sickness. Another example is the introduction in New Zealand of the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), which transmits bovine tuberculosis to cattle and deer, posing a large economic threat that has led to millions of New Zealand dollars in control costs. Lastly, invasive mosquitoes have exacerbated the spread of yellow fever, dengue fever, and other infectious diseases throughout the Americas and Asia.3Pejchar L Mooney HA Invasive Species, ecosystem services and human well-being.Trends Ecol Evol. 2009; 24: 497-504Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar As one study concluded, the effects of invasive alien species on human health \"vary from psychological effects, discomfort, nuisance and phobias to skin irritations, allergies, poisoning, disease and even death.\"7Martinou A Roy H Introduction: from local strategy to global frameworks.in: Mazza G Tricarico E Invasive species and human health. CABI, Oxford2018: ix-xxiiGoogle Scholar Many invasive alien species are, in effect, opportunistic hitchhikers, taking advantage of global shipping and other forms of transit, whereas others were deliberately introduced for economic gain or recreational purposes. Global environmental change, including land use and climate change,6Hulme PE Climate change and biological invasions: evidence, expectations, and response options.Biol Rev. 2017; 92: 1297-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar can increase the rates of establishment and spread of invasive alien species. Illegal logging, fishing, and wildlife trade further exacerbates the problem, and even conservation efforts such as rewilding and assisted colonisation might in turn lead to the introduction of more invasive alien species. However, and despite the marked increase in our understanding of these species and their multitude of interactions at varying scales, a truly comprehensive, international, and interdisciplinary assessment on the drivers, effects, management, and future scenarios of invasive alien species has yet to be done. Therefore, the first IPBES assessment on invasive alien species, which kicked off in 2019 with a stimulating and productive inaugural authors' meeting in Tsukuba, Japan, is not only timely, but also directly relevance to global health policy and its practitioners and strategists. More than 70 experts—carefully selected to encompass all regions, expertise, and marine and terrestrial realms and to consider gender and equity factors—will be assessing the current status and trends of biological invasions and providing options to promote effective prioritisation, mitigation, surveillance,4Latombe G Pyšek P Jeschke JM et al.A vision for global monitoring of biological invasions.Biol Conser. 2017; 213: 295-308Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar and adaptation strategies. The completed assessment will be presented to the tenth session of the IPBES plenary, comprising representatives from more than 130 member states. This assessment will cover invasion pathways and drivers; effects5Essl F Hulme PE Jeschke JM et al.Scientific and normative foundations for the valuation of alien species impacts: twelve core principles.Bioscience. 2016; 67: 166-178Google Scholar on biodiversity, ecosystems, food supply, and human health; and future policy paths. As with all IPBES assessments, special attention will be paid to human dimensions, including the important role of indigenous and local knowledge8Ban NC Frid A Reid M Edgar B Shaw D Siwallace P Incorporate Indigenous perspectives for impactful research and effective management.Nat Ecol Evol. 2018; 2: 1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and of contemporary technology in our evolving understanding of biological invasions. A socio-ecological systems approach will give us a panoramic view that brings the natural and social sciences together with a range of other knowledge systems for this monumental task. As co-chairs, we are confident that this international assessment will not only make considerable strides towards more effective strategies, but also reveal conceptual and scientific areas in need of urgent attention. Indeed, we expect to identify many knowledge gaps to inspire the next generation of research and policy design. We have been encouraged by the support of governments and experts alike at this early stage of the assessment, and we believe that the global and planetary health community will also have much to contribute to this landmark study. We declare no competing interests.",

First, declare a timeframe for peak livestock—ie, livestock production from each species would not continue to increase from this point forward. Second, within the livestock sector, identify the largest emissions sources or the largest land occupiers, or both, and set appropriate reduction targets for production. This process would be repeated sequentially, to set reduction targets for the next largest emitter or land occupier. Third, within a reconfiguration of the agriculture sector, apply a best available food strategy to diversify food production by replacing livestock with foods that simultaneously minimise environmental burdens and maximise public health benefits—mainly pulses (including beans, peas, and lentils), grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.5Harwatt H Including animal to plant protein shifts in climate change mitigation policy: a proposed three-step strategy.Climate Policy. 2018; 19: 533-541Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Springmann M Wiebe K Mason-D'Croz D Sulser TB Rayner M Scarborough P Health and nutritional aspects of sustainable diet strategies and their association with environmental impacts: a global modelling analysis with country-level detail.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e451-e461Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar Fourth, when grazing land is not required or is unsuitable for horticulture or arable production, adopt a natural climate solutions approach where possible, to repurpose land as a carbon sink by restoring native vegetation cover to its maximum carbon sequestration potential,2Lewis SL Wheeler C Mitchard E Koch A Restoring natural forests is the best way to remove atmospheric carbon.Nature. 2019; 568: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar with additional benefits to biodiversity.9Diaz S Settele J Brondízio E et al.Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Summary for policymakers of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. IPBES secretariat, Bonn, Germany2019Google Scholar We propose that in creating Paris-compliant agriculture sectors, high-income and middle-income countries do not outsource their livestock production to other countries, and instead reduce demand for livestock products. Although our suggestions are not a full list of mitigation actions for the agriculture sector, they are necessary to adhere to the equity component of the Paris Agreement, and are considered part of a suite of measures that are needed across all sectors to reduce the risk of reaching temperature levels beyond the Paris goals. We will provide further scientific evidence about these important topics during the ongoing revision of Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement. We declare no competing interests. Signatories speak on their own behalf, and not on behalf of their affiliated institutions. The list of signatories supporting our call can be found in appendix 2.

It's not surprising then that 2020 is shaping up to be a critical year in establishing ambition for climate and biodiversity action. There is much optimism and anticipation that this year could be a turning point in our relationship with nature, leading to the notion of 2020 being a \"super year\" for the environment. But this will only happen through conscious effort, if we drift on as we are, it will be far from super for people or the planet. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "The need to apply a systems approach to planetary health is well recognised.1The Lancet Planetary HealthWelcome to The Lancet Planetary Health.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e1Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar Such an approach has enabled a better understanding of the links between factors such as climate change, ecosystem conditions, and marine conservation efforts on fisheries sustainability,2Lombard AT Dorrington RA Reed JR et al.Key challenges in advancing an ecosystem-based approach to marine spatial planning under economic growth imperatives.Front Mar Sci. 2019; 6: 1-11Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar and between heat stress, water shortages, food availability, and the health of people older than 65 years.3Stevenson M Thompson J Health and the compact city.in: Decarbonising the built environment. Palgrave Macmillan, Singapore2019: 245-258Crossref Google Scholar Fieldwork in India to investigate poultry practices that drive antibiotic resistance shows that by keeping a systems approach in mind one can get closer to the root cause of challenges. These challenges might run far deeper than initial observations and assumptions make visible. Across the world, high use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry production is most often attributed to low compliance with regulation and poor antimicrobial stewardship.4Laxminarayan R Chaudhury RR Antibiotic resistance in India: drivers and opportunities for action.PLoS Med. 2016; 13e1001974Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar The long-term harm from antibiotic resistance is often overlooked when compared with the benefits of antibiotic use, particularly as the costs associated with antimicrobial resistance in human health are an externality to the farming industry.5Giubilini A Birkl P Douglas T Savulescu J Maslen H Taxing meat: taking responsibility for one's contribution to antibiotic resistance.J Agric Environ Ethics. 2017; 30: 179-198Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar Changing use patterns requires system-wide adaptation, including acceptance of alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (APGs), increased vaccination, and improved natural immunity. The latter could in turn depend on better farm hygiene and welfare conditions to reduce infection and thus the need for treatment. The impact of higher temperatures on poultry growth rates and egg production is acknowledged,6Nyoni NM Grab S Archer ER Heat stress and chickens: climate risk effects on rural poultry farming in low-income countries.Clim Dev. 2019; 11: 83-90Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar but climate pressures on poultry farming can influence many of the aforementioned approaches to poultry health and disease control. In the rural areas around Bangalore, farmers are increasingly moving from crop production to poultry rearing as water shortages and higher temperatures hamper crop productivity and reduce the reliability of crops as a regular source of income.7Kattumuri R Ravindranath D Esteves T Local adaptation strategies in semi-arid regions: study of two villages in Karnataka, India.Clim Dev. 2017; 9: 36-49Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar Since 2018, this has been exacerbated by an epidemic of Spodoptera frugiperda (Fall armyworm), an invasive parasite that was brought into India with American maize that is resilient to hot, dry conditions and became a popular local crop. Fall armyworm has attacked other crops, including sugarcane and chickpea, as well as maize. Poultry production is less water-intensive than crop farming and provides a more reliable year-round income, but requires more antibiotic input to address disease challenges. An increase in poultry farming at a time of increasing local average temperature (predicted to rise between 1·8°C and 3·3°C in Karnataka by 2030 with respect to the baseline period 1961–908Murari KK Mahato S Jayaraman T Swaminathan M Extreme temperatures and crop yields in Karnataka, India.Rev Agrarian Stud. 2018; 8: 92-114Google Scholar) is likely to result in increasing incidences of heat stress-related morbidity. Heat stress drives antibiotic use not only by causing immune system compromise and leaving broiler chickens more susceptible to bacterial infection, but also by causing symptoms such as decreased appetite and diarrhoea that might be mistaken, particularly by less experienced farmers (as many of those moving into poultry farming are), as infections that can be treated with antibiotics. Commercial breeds, such as Ross, Arbor Acres, and Hubbard, which were selectively bred for production in the milder climes of North America and Europe, often lack resilience to local conditions. Vencobb, a locally bred variation of the Cobb breed, is better able to tolerate hotter conditions, but there has been little investigation into the potential introduction of indigenous Indian breeds, such as Chittagong and Aseel, as well as those from other heat and water-stressed regions that might be more tolerant to higher temperatures, into local commercial broiler production. Climate pressures also affect how biosecurity is enacted. Most birds are raised in open sheds from which disease-carrying rodents and wild birds are hard to keep out. Temperatures in closed sheds would be uncomfortably high without environmental control,9Pawar SS Sajjanar B Lonkar VD et al.Assessing and mitigating the impact of heat stress on poultry.Adv Animal Vet Sci. 2016; 4: 332-341Crossref Google Scholar but powering such sheds is challenged by pressures on the energy system: power cuts are common and in some rural areas, electricity from the national grid is rationed for agricultural use. Self-generation of energy cannot easily fill the gap as poultry waste produces insufficient energy to power biogas digesters and energy produced by solar panels is diverted to the national grid and is subject to the same challenges. Furthermore, there is a perception that birds raised in environmentally controlled, cooler temperatures could be more susceptible to heat-related mortality during transport to, and while on sale, at live markets. If correct, this will require a concurrent shift to near-farm processing plants, chilling plants, and cold chain storage, substantially increasing the carbon footprint of the farm-to-fork food chain and the cost of meat to consumers. The Indian consumer preference for buying live birds at market would also need to change. The poultry system thus faces a number of inter-related stressors from climate change. A planetary health lens, through which the entire system is approached, could offer potential solutions. Local building materials and traditional practices that could mitigate heat stress and spread of disease risk being overlooked if poultry systems are approached only from the perspective of modernising the Indian system to Global North standards. Energy policies might need to readdress how rural areas are able to use self-generated energy. The intensive production of chickens has been identified as one of the markers of the Anthropocene.10Bennett CE Thomas R Williams M et al.The broiler chicken as a signal of a human reconfigured biosphere.R Soc Open Sci. 2018; 5180325Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar Chickens sit at an intersection of food systems, environmental change, global health, and biodiversity. Understanding this intersection and the pressures on the systems to which it connects could suggest potential adaptations to other stressed systems as well as helping to preserve the efficacy of antibiotics into the future.

    "ab": "BackgroundHurricanes and other natural disasters produce public health and economic consequences that last well beyond their immediate aftermath. Resource loss is a core driver of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after large-scale traumatic events. We examined the effect of restoration of residential and housing-related financial resources on recovery from PTSD in post-disaster contexts.MethodsWe built an agent-based model, empiricised with observational and experimental data, to test the effects of differing health service approaches on PTSD recovery, measured by prevalence and persistence. We tested a social services case management (SSCM) approach similar to Psychological First Aid, featuring shelter-based social service provision and linkage to mental health treatment for people who were displaced and had income loss, by comparing the treatment effectiveness of usual care alone, usual care with SSCM, stepped care alone, and stepped care with SSCM.FindingsAn SSCM approach to restore housing and provide linkage to mental health services among people who were displaced and had income loss after a large-scale natural disaster resulted in between 1·56 (95% CI 1·55–1·57) and 5·73 (5·04–6·91) times as many remitted PTSD cases as non-SSCM conditions at the end of the first year, and between 1·16 (1·16–1·17) and 2·28 (2·25–2·32) times as many remitted cases at the end of the second year.InterpretationRestoring economic and housing resources to populations affected by a natural disaster would significantly reduce the mental health burden in populations, particularly those with resource loss, after a disaster.FundingUS Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "ab": "BackgroundDengue has become a major public health problem in Sri Lanka with a considerable economic burden. As a response, in June, 2014, the Ministry of Health initiated a proactive vector control programme in partnership with military and police forces, known as the Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC) programme, that was targeted at high-risk Medical Officer of Health (MOH) divisions in the country. Evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of population-level interventions is essential to guide public health planning and resource allocation decisions, particularly in resource-limited health-care settings.MethodsUsing an interrupted time series design with a non-linear extension, we evaluated the impact of vector control interventions from June 22, 2014, to Dec 29, 2016, in Panadura, a high-risk MOH division in Western Province, Sri Lanka. We used dengue notification and larval survey data to estimate the reduction in Breteau index and dengue incidence before and after the intervention using two separate models, adjusting for time-varying confounding variables (ie, rainfall, temperature, and the Oceanic Niño Index). We also assessed the cost and cost-effectiveness of the CIMIC programme from the perspective of the National Dengue Control Unit under the scenarios of different levels of hospitalisation of dengue cases (low [25%], medium [50%], and high [75%]) in terms of cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted (DALY).FindingsVector control interventions had a significant impact on combined Breteau index (relative risk reduction 0·43, 95% CI 0·26 to 0·70) and on dengue incidence (0·43, 0·28 to 0·67), the latter becoming prominent 2 months after the intervention onset. The mean number of averted dengue cases was estimated at 2192 (95% CI 1741 to 2643), and the total cost of the CIMIC programme at 2016 US$271 615. Personnel costs accounted for about 89% of the total cost. In the base-case scenario of moderate level of hospitalisation, the CIMIC programme was cost-saving with a probability of 70% under both the lowest ($453) and highest ($1686) cost-effectiveness thresholds, resulting in a net saving of $20 247 (95% CI −57 266 to 97 790) and averting 176 DALYs (133 to 226), leading to a cost of −$98 (−497 to 395) per DALY averted. This was also the case for the scenario with high hospitalisation levels (cost per DALY averted −$512, 95% CI −872 to −115) but with a higher probability of 99%. In the scenario with low hospitalisation levels (cost per DALY averted $690, 143 to 1379), although the CIMIC programme was cost-ineffective at the lowest threshold with a probability of 77%, it was cost-effective at the highest threshold with a probability of 99%.InterpretationThis study suggests that communities affected by dengue can benefit from investments in vector control if interventions are implemented rigorously and coordinated well across sectors. By doing so, it is possible to reduce the disease and economic burden of dengue in endemic settings.FundingNone.",

    "ab": "BackgroundTwo international Conventions from the International Labor Organization (ILO; C162 Asbestos Convention) and the UN (Basel Convention) offer governments guidelines for achieving a total asbestos ban policy, but the long-term effect of these Conventions on policy implementation, and the role of government effectiveness, remains unknown. We aimed to investigate associations between government ratification of the ILO and UN international Conventions, government effectiveness, and implementation of a national total asbestos ban.MethodsWe obtained data for year of a national asbestos ban, year of ratification of one or both international Conventions, and World Bank government effectiveness scores for 108 countries that ever used asbestos. We did a survival analysis for countries with data in the follow-up period (March 22, 1989, to Feb 2, 2018) to assess whether ratification of the international Conventions and greater government effectiveness were associated with time of implementation of a national total asbestos ban.FindingsOf 108 countries with data for asbestos consumption, nine were excluded because they implemented an asbestos ban before 1989. Therefore, 99 countries were included in the survival analysis. 26 countries ratified both international Conventions and 73 ratified either one or no Convention. Countries that ratified both Conventions had a shorter time to adoption of a total asbestos ban (mean 8·9 [SD 6·4] years) than did countries that ratified one or no Conventions (16·9 [6·1] years). After controlling for government effectiveness, countries that ratified both Conventions had a significantly higher conditional probability of banning asbestos than did those ratifying one or no Convention (hazard ratio [HR] 41·8, 95% CI 4·5–383·3; p=0·0010). For every 1 point increment in government effectiveness, the percentage change in HR for persistent asbestos consumption significantly increased by 127% (95% CI 13–354; p=0·021).InterpretationThis study confirms that adoption of both the C162 Asbestos Convention and the Basel Convention facilitates countries in moving towards a total asbestos ban. The effect was reinforced by government effectiveness. Both international programmes and new agreements towards total asbestos bans and government commitments are needed.FundingChina Medical University, and the Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan).",

    "ab": "Generally, health inequalities refer to disparities that are unnecessary, unjust, and avoidable.1WHO10 facts on health inequities and their causes. World Health Organization, Geneva2017https://www.who.int/features/factfiles/health_inequities/en/Date accessed: December 3, 2019Google Scholar Latin America has some of the most persistent health inequalities in the world, and a wide range of life expectancies at birth.2Cardona D Acosta LD Bertone CL [Inequities in health among Latin American and Caribbean countries (2005-2010)].Gac Sanit. 2013; 27: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar These inequalities are not only due to health disparities, but are also affected by the surrounding social dynamics. The Article by Usama Bilal and colleagues in The Lancet Planetary Health3Bilal U Alazraqui M Caiaffa WT et al.Inequalities in life expectancy in six large Latin American cities from the SALURBAL study: an ecological analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; (published online Dec 10)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(19)30235-9Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar contributes to the literature on health inequalities by analysing the spatial gaps in life expectancy at birth and their association with socioeconomic status at the subcity level in six Latin American cities. Using various statistical, demographic, and geospatial tools, they analysed data from Buenos Aires, Argentina; Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; San José, Costa Rica; Mexico City, Mexico; and Panama City, Panama; comprising 266 subcity units, from 2011 to 2016. They found large differences between the ninth and first decile of life expectancy at birth (P90–P10 gap), with the largest gaps in see in Panama City (15·0 years for men and 14·7 years for women), Santiago (8·9 years for men and 17·7 years for women), and Mexico City (10·9 years for men and 9·4 years for women), and the narrowest gaps in Buenos Aires (4·4 years for men and 5·8 years for women), Belo Horizonte (4·0 years for men and 6·5 years for women), and San José (3·9 years for men and 3·0 years for women). They also found that social disparities directly and indirectly affect people's health. Using P90–P10 change unit-level educational attainment as a proxy for socioeconomic status, they found higher area-level socioeconomic status to be associated with higher life expectancy, particularly in Santiago (change in life expectancy of 8·0 years [95% CI 5·8–10·3] for men and 11·8 years [7·1–16·4] for women) and Panama City (7·3 years [2·6–12·1] for men and 9·0 years [2·4–15·5] for women). Such disparities are known to restrict people's access to and use of health services.4Barros MB Francisco PM Zanchetta LM César CL [Trends in social and demographic inequalities in the prevalence of chronic diseases in Brazil. PNAD: 2003- 2008].Cien Saude Colet. 2011; 16 (in Portuguese).: 3755-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar In this sense, health disparities should be considered a by-product of a population's deficient living conditions.5Carvalho RA Santos VS Melo CM Gurgel RQ Oliveira CC Inequalities in health: living conditions and infant mortality in Northeastern Brazil.Rev Saude Publica. 2015; 49: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar This study's findings raise several questions, such as, what are the causes of death that most increase a population's years of life lost? What age groups are most affected by these health inequalities? How do these disparities change over time? Differences and changes in life expectancy among different age groups, owing to illness or injury, are calculated by breaking down the different life expectancies in a population or subpopulation.6Beltrán-Sánchez H Preston SH Canudas-Romo V An integrated approach to cause-of-death analysis: cause-deleted life tables and decompositions of life expectancy.Demogr Res. 2008; 19: 1323-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar This type of analysis provides a more detailed panorama of disparities in life expectancy and studying these differences over time shows which diseases and injuries increase or decrease a population's health inequalities. This information is very useful for those creating public policy and allocating health resources.7Bennett JE Pearson-Stuttard J Kontis V Capewell S Wolfe I Ezzati M Contributions of diseases and injuries to widening life expectancy inequalities in England from 2001 to 2016: a population-based analysis of vital registration data.Lancet Public Health. 2018; 3: e586-e597Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar Future research in this area should take other approaches to account for health inequalities and use a conceptual and multidimensional perspective. Several additional indicators could be used, such as measurements of disability, disease burden, or healthy life expectancy; these factors also directly or indirectly affect life expectancy at birth. Deeper exploration of health inequalities is needed. Most of the available relevant data are at a national scale, while little is known about health indicators in cities and at the subcity level. National-level or state-level data often hide the true dimensions of a problem and internal disparities. Thus, analysing these inequalities is fully appropriate to establish specific needs and priorities in each subarea, as a function of its social, economic, political, and cultural context. Such analysis is a powerful tool for policy and decision making. Evidence indicates that most of the causes of mortality that are decreasing life expectancy in Latin American are potentially avoidable.8Aburto JM Riffe T Canudas-Romo V Trends in avoidable mortality over the life course in Mexico, 1990–2015: a cross-sectional demographic analysis.BMJ Open. 2018; 8e022350Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9Dávila-Cervantes C Agudelo-Botero M Changes in life expectancy due to avoidable and non-avoidable deaths in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, 2000–2011.Cad Saude Publica. 2018; 34e00093417Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar Given the region's high health inequalities, work towards a life expectancy at birth level to which all individuals can aspire is crucial, independently of where they were born, grew up, or live today. In summary, the findings of Bilal and colleagues point towards specific geographical areas of the cities studied that require focused health promotion and disease prevention efforts via risk prediction and early diagnosis. Work in these areas must also focus on health-care access and quality, and the implementation of intersectoral public policies. Public health strategies should aim to reduce the life expectancy gap and consider the urban spatial segregation and socioeconomic factors that are connected with these disparities. We believe that these factors are essential for understanding health inequalities. Bilal and colleagues have laid the foundations for monitoring the benchmarks associated with the Sustainable Development Goals, the objective of which is to leave no one behind. We declare no competing interests.

    "ab": "The implementation of an effective collaboration between human and veterinary medicine, environmental protection, and public health is not a fully achieved goal, although several examples of integrated approaches have been documented in Europe. The concept of one world, one health has recently appeared, indicating that the world has suddenly woken up to the link between animal diseases, public health, and the environment. The need for collaboration between the human, animal, and environmental health sectors is due to the increase in emerging human infectious diseases with a zoonotic origin and in the resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobial drugs.1Sikkema R Koopmans M One Health training and research activities in western Europe.Infect Ecol Epidemiol. 2016; 6: 33703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar The main fields in which this new concept of collaboration has been applied are zoonosis and zooprophylaxis, vaccines, and antibiotic resistance, via the establishment of networks of professionals in the One Health area. The historical background of One Health laid the foundations for the realisation of concrete interventions or future perspectives of collaboration between human, veterinarian, and environmental institutions. In the late 19th century, German physician and pathologist Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902) coined the term zoonosis and stated that \"between animal and human medicine there are no dividing lines—nor should there be\".2Klauder J Interrelations of human and veterinary medicine.N Eng J Med. 1958; 258: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar The dimension of the zoonosis problem is a cause for alarm because zoonotic pathogens represent a clear threat to global health: these pathogens are globally present, accounting for about 75% of emerging infectious diseases affecting humans. Over the past year, zoonotic pathogens caused more than 2 million deaths and over 2 billion cases of human illness.3Corning S World Organisation for Animal Health: strengthening Veterinary Services for effective One Health collaboration.Rev Sci Tech. 2014; 33: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar Zoonotic diseases are a growing concern: approximately 60% of existing human pathogens and over 75% of those appeared during the past two decades can be traced back to animals.4Dehove A One world, one health.Transbound Emerg Dis. 2010; 57: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar Only since the 1990s has the relationship between human and veterinary medicine started receiving substantial attention from the scientific community. Many examples of successfully realised integrated approaches have shown how human health is related to the health of animals and the environment (eg, in the spreading of diseases such as rabies, salmonellosis, west Nile virus fever, Q fever, bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy). Some collaborations between human and veterinary medicine were proposed for the future, but have not been realised yet. Among these projects are those for the elimination of neurocysticercosis and the control of its public health impact in endemic areas, by proposing operational interventions based on oriented chemotherapy, using existing healthcare facilities, and improving collaboration between medical and veterinary services; 5Pawlowski ZS Control of neurocysticercosis by routine medical and veterinary services.Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2008; 102: 228-232Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar the organisation of international meetings involving specialists in different areas; and the implementation of veterinary urban hygiene, a cultural revolution in the zoonosis approach, defined as the activities that deal with health aspects associated with human–animal–environment connections in urban areas. 6Mantovani A Notes on the development of the concept of zoonoses.Hist Med Vet. 2001; 26: 41-52Google Scholar As concerns vaccines, they have a key role within One Health since they can control disease transmission between humans and animals, and have a concrete impact on their shared environments. The best-known example of a vaccine contribution in terms of One Health is provided by the discovery of the vaccination against smallpox. This discovery was based on the close resemblance of smallpox, a human disease, to cowpox, a zoonotic disease affecting animals: the observation that dairy farmers were immune to smallpox inspired the production of the first smallpox vaccine, which was the first step towards eradication of this disease. Other examples are the campaign to develop the canine-distemper vaccine in the UK between 1922 and 1933, which was based on collaborations between veterinary professionals, government scientists, the UK Medical Research Council, and a commercial pharmaceutical house,7Bresalier M Worboys M 'Saving the lives of our dogs': the development of canine distemper vaccine in interwar Britain.Br J Hist Sci. 2014; 47: 305-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and the development of the diphtheria antitoxin in the late 19th century, which played a significant role in the history of public health and vaccinology. Furthermore, a new generation of cost-effective and efficient poultry vaccines could be applied in the future with mass immunisation methods that would induce local immunity to control the spread of the H5 and H7 avian influenza virus subtypes.8van den Berg T Lambrecht B Marché S Steensels M Van Borm S Bublot M Influenza vaccines and vaccination strategies in birds.Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis. 2008; 31: 121-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar Interprofessional collaboration has been promoted worldwide by the creation of networks of professionals in the fields of health and environment, tasked with bridging the communication gap between science and society: the Med-Vet-Net network, the HENVINET project, ArboZoonet, Disease Bioportal, GLEWS, Global Food Safety Portal, NBIC, and EpiSPIDER represent some of the most important examples.9Busani L Caprioli A Macrì A Mantovani A Scavia G Seimenis A Multidisciplinary collaboration in veterinary public health.Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2006; 42: 397-496PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bartonova A How can scientists bring research to use: the HENVINET experience.Environ Health. 2012; 11: S2Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar Although increasing attention has been given towards One Health programmes, many European countries show little cooperation among different areas. Many countries have merged the One Health approach with their policies against zoonosis and antimicrobial resistance, and veterinarians seem to show a greater awareness of the importance of cooperation activities and continuous cross-sectoral formation than do medical doctors. The institution of a specific founding system for One Health initiatives could help to break down barriers with the aim of promoting a multidisciplinary attitude. We declare no competing interest. Introducing One Health to medical and veterinary studentsWe read with interest the Comment by Maria De Giusti and colleagues,1 in which they highlight the benefits of using a One Health approach in human and veterinary medicine. As the authors aptly describe, human and veterinary medicine share common issues and challenges, such as zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance. An interdisciplinary approach might be effective in overcoming the challenges common to both human and animal health. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "BackgroundClimate change threatens to undermine recent progress in reducing global deaths from diarrhoeal disease in children. However, the scarcity of evidence about how individual environmental factors affect transmission of specific pathogens makes prediction of trends under different climate scenarios challenging. We aimed to model associations between daily estimates of a suite of hydrometeorological variables and rotavirus infection status ascertained through community-based surveillance.MethodsFor this analysis of multisite cohort data, rotavirus infection status was ascertained through community-based surveillance of infants in the eight-site MAL-ED cohort study, and matched by date with earth observation estimates of nine hydrometeorological variables from the Global Land Data Assimilation System: daily total precipitation volume (mm), daily total surface runoff (mm), surface pressure (mbar), wind speed (m/s), relative humidity (%), soil moisture (%), solar radiation (W/m2), specific humidity (kg/kg), and average daily temperatures (°C). Lag relationships, independent effects, and interactions were characterised by use of modified Poisson models and compared with and without adjustment for seasonality and between-site variation. Final models were created with stepwise selection of main effects and interactions and their validity assessed by excluding each site in turn and calculating Tjur's Coefficients of Determination.FindingsAll nine hydrometeorological variables were significantly associated with rotavirus infection after adjusting for seasonality and between-site variation over multiple consecutive or non-consecutive lags, showing complex, often non-linear associations that differed by symptom status and showed considerable mutual interaction. The final models explained 5·9% to 6·2% of the variability in rotavirus infection in the pooled data and their predictions explained between 0·0% and 14·1% of the variability at individual study sites.InterpretationThese results suggest that the effect of climate on rotavirus transmission was mediated by four independent mechanisms: waterborne dispersal, airborne dispersal, virus survival on soil and surfaces, and host factors. Earth observation data products available at a global scale and at subdaily resolution can be combined with longitudinal surveillance data to test hypotheses about routes and drivers of transmission but showed little potential for making predictions in this setting.FundingBill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Health, Fogarty International Center; Sherrilyn and Ken Fisher Center for Environmental Infectious Diseases, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; and NASA's Group on Earth Observations Work Programme.",

    "ab": "BackgroundTo date, the effects of extreme weather events on nutrient supply within the population have not been quantified. In this study, we investigated micronutrient, macronutrient, and fibre supply changes during 175 extreme weather events within 87 countries in the year that a major extreme weather event occurred, with a targeted focus on low-income settings.MethodsWe collected data from the International Disasters Database and the Global Expanded Nutrient Supply model for the period 1961–2010, and applied superposed epoch analysis to calculate the percentage change in nutrient supply during the year of an extreme weather event relative to its historical context. We composited globally and by subgroup (EU, landlocked developing countries, least developed countries, low-income food deficit countries, and net food-importing developing countries). Lastly, we reported nutrient supply changes in terms of recommended dietary allowance for children aged 1–3 years.FindingsGlobally, all micronutrient supplies had a modest negative percentage change during the year of an extreme weather event; of these effects, those that reached an α=0·05 significance level included calcium, folate, thiamin, vitamin B6, and vitamin C, with nutrient supply changes ranging from −0·40 to −1·73% of the average supply. The effect of an extreme weather event was especially magnified among landlocked developing countries and low-income food deficit countries, with significant nutrient supply changes ranging from −1·61 to −7·57% of the average supply. Furthermore, the observed nutrient supply deficits in landlocked developing countries constituted a large percentage (ranging from 1·95 to 39·19%) of what a healthy child's sufficient average dietary intake should be.InterpretationThe global effects of extreme weather events on nutrient supply found in this study are modest in isolation; however, in the context of nutrient needs for healthy child development in low-income settings, the effects observed are substantial.FundingAustralian-American Fulbright Commission.",

    "ab": "16-year-old Greta Thunberg's insurgence on the world stage has startled us all. Her School Strike For Climate movement is mobilising a generation of young people to challenge their governments' failure to deliver meaningful climate action. It is no longer possible to view the victims of climate change as abstract future generations: their disillusioned faces line our streets every Friday. This month the UN will be holding its first Youth Climate Summit in New York (NY, USA). The day before, a global youth climate strike is set to be the largest mass climate protest the world has ever seen. These historic occasions demand reflection by those working in planetary health about how they can be agents for meaningful youth engagement. As a field with a strong focus on the health and wellbeing of future generations, we call on the planetary health community to champion youth leadership. Thunberg has begun to mobilise millions of youth whose talents, creativity, and passions are ready to be harnessed for action. Young people have unique skills and attributes that might help overcome the impasses and incrementalism that have plagued sustainability efforts in recent years. As David Attenborough has stated \"we cannot be radical enough\" in tackling the climate crisis.1Vaughan A David Attenborough on climate change: \"We cannot be radical enough\".https://www.newscientist.com/article/2209126-david-attenborough-on-climate-change-we-cannot-be-radical-enough/Date: July 9, 2019Date accessed: September 11, 2019Google Scholar To achieve such transformative action, society needs young people's open mindedness, their willingness to take risks, and their ability to innovate. Given their minimal vested interest in existing power structures, youth can question the status quo and speak truth to authority figures if given a place at the decision-making table. Those in positions of power might question the capacity of youth to effectively make decisions of such importance. However, the Lancet Commission on adolescent health and wellbeing identified that most youth are developmentally ready to make choices about their health and vote at age 16 years.2Patton GC Sawyer SM Santelli JS et al.Our future: a Lancet commission on adolescent health and wellbeing.Lancet. 2016; 387: 2423-2478Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar To realise planetary health's goal of ensuring that the decisions made by today's society protect the health and wellbeing of those who will inherit the world tomorrow, young people must not only be heard but listened to. Youth engagement is an investment in young people's abilities and ingrains longevity into the planetary health vision, by ensuring it is the vision held by those who will lead tomorrow. Fortunately, planetary health, as a nascent discipline, is perfectly situated to take the lead on meaningful youth engagement. Where other fields have struggled to retrofit youth into existing governance structures, planetary health can include youth into all tiers of its agenda from the outset.3Lal A Bulc B Bewa MJ et al.Changing the narrative: responsibility for youth engagement is a two-way street.Lancet Child Adolesc Health. 2019; (published online Aug 9.)http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2352-4642(19)30247-0Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar How, then, can the planetary health community realise this vision? And how can it avoid falling into the twin traps of tokenism and exploitation that have undermined well intentioned efforts at youth engagement in global health, more broadly? Herein, we propose a set of practice points (consultation, facilitation, accountability, and evidence) for championing youth leadership in planetary health and present four case studies that exemplify them in action (panel). These practice points are based on the growing body of literature describing effective youth engagement that has emerged over the past two decades, and thus present those working in planetary health with the opportunity to learn from these experiences. 4WHOEngaging young people for health and sustainable development: strategic opportunities for the World Health Organization and partners.

First, structured, systematic consultation with young people must guide work in planetary health. Leaders in planetary health need to establish clear, consistent, and safe opportunities for young people in agenda setting and decision making and provide support and resources for translating youth input into tangible outcomes. Dedicated youth ambassadors and advisory bodies are a potentially useful starting point. However, consulting select groups of young people is not an adequate substitute for engagement with a broad spectrum of youth perspectives. Planetary health leaders must therefore develop comprehensive youth consultation and engagement strategies to maximise the diversity of available youth expertise. These strategies should include deliberate effort to seek out marginalised groups, whose voices are often not heard. Second, as well as providing opportunities for young people to participate in planetary health, leaders must facilitate youth participation by identifying and removing barriers. Many of these barriers are inherent to the adult-centric nature of institutions and decision-making processes, and without necessary orientation and support young people can be left disempowered. The accessibility of opportunities across diverse groups of young people should be a key priority. Funding is another notable barrier to equitable youth participation. Planetary health organisations must, therefore, allocate funding for youth engagement, including adequately remunerating young people for the time and expertise they contribute. Third, the planetary health sector must hold itself accountable for the adequacy and efficacy of its youth engagement and strive for consistent improvement. To this end, young people should be involved in the design and implementation of appropriate monitoring and evaluation frameworks. The sector would benefit from developing a common set of indicators of youth engagement. Monitoring and evaluation should occur systematically and consistently and provide a basis for young people to both provide and receive regular feedback on their participation in planetary health initiatives. Finally, the planetary health sector should work to enhance the evidence base supporting youth participation in public health programs, governance, and resource management. Doing so would help to provide a mandate for youth leadership in a variety of sectors and help counter misguided assumptions about the efficacy of youth input in shaping health priorities and action in local, national, and international arenas. Planetary health journals should seek out and publish evidence on the efficacy of youth-driven initiatives. Youth have spoken over recent years and their voices only grow louder. It is no longer enough to pursue sustainable development for them, it must be done with them. Their unique perspectives, attributes, and experiences must be sincerely valued. Planetary health has the opportunity to exemplify what it means to meaningfully engage youth. In this Comment, we detail principles essential for shifting from tokenistic to meaningful youth engagement. By focusing on broad consultation, facilitation, accountability, and building an evidence base, we can achieve this essential goal. We call on the planetary health community to reflect on its values and framework and realise that empowerment, mobilisation, and partnership with youth lies at the core of the discipline, and should be placed at the forefront of all of its work.

    "ab": "According to the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study of 195 countries,1Afshin A Sur PJ Fay KA et al.Health effects of dietary risks in 195 countries, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.Lancet. 2019; 393: 1958-1972Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar dietary factors are the single leading cause of death, exacting an even greater health burden than smoking. For that reason, if medical education were to be based solely on the needs of patient and population health, nutrition would surely be meaningfully addressed. But, in defiance of the obvious need for physicians to possess, at minimum, solid foundational skills in clinical nutrition, medical education in nutrition across the globe is decidedly lacking. That is the conclusion of the study by Jennifer Crowley and colleagues in The Lancet Planetary Health.2Crowley JJ Ball L Hiddink GJ Nutrition in medical education: a systematic review.Lancet Plan Health. 2019; 3: e379-e389Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar The report summarised findings from 24 studies of nutrition education in medical schools throughout USA, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The studies examined several facets of the nutrition-related experience of medical students, including attitudes, knowledge, and confidence in recommending nutritional interventions. Although the methods and survey tools varied among the studies evaluated, the findings worldwide were remarkably similar. Nutrition knowledge and confidence in counselling among medical students were uniformly low, as was the students' perception of both the quality and quantity of their nutrition education. Despite the paucity of nutrition curriculum in medical school, the study found that interest among medical students in nutrition is uniformly high. Previous research has shown that keen interest in nutrition among incoming medical students typically wanes by the time of graduation.3Weinsier RL Boker JR Morgan SL et al.Cross-sectional study of nutrition knowledge and attitudes of medical students at three points in their medical training at 11 southeastern medical schools.Am J Clin Nutr. 1988; 48: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar It is easy to imagine why. When medical students do not see nutrition substantively incorporated into their curriculum and do not observe clinical mentors incorporating nutritional interventions into their care plans, what else can they conclude but that nutrition is not as important as they had once believed? The review by Crowley and colleagues2Crowley JJ Ball L Hiddink GJ Nutrition in medical education: a systematic review.Lancet Plan Health. 2019; 3: e379-e389Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar adds to the existing medical literature4Aggarwal M Devries S Freeman AM et al.The deficit of nutrition education of physicians.Am J Med. 2018; 131: 339-345Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar in framing the gap in nutrition education in medical school as a global phenomenon as well as providing a glimpse of a blueprint for moving forward. The obstacles to delivering meaningful nutrition education are well described in this study and appear to be similar on every continent studied—a perceived lack of interest and expertise among faculty members in nutrition, low-quality nutrition curriculum that did not appear to be prioritised, and few examples of nutritional counselling during clinical years to serve as models for emerging physicians. Each geographic region has a unique set of predominant nutritional challenges and opportunities, nevertheless, a global need exists for physicians to understand the strong connection between nutrition and health. For example, in the past 30 years, the global prevalence of diabetes has nearly doubled.5WHOGlobal report on diabetes. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2016Google Scholar Beyond the lost opportunities for improving patient health, this study correctly frames the global lack of nutrition education in medicine as an issue that impacts planetary health, as described in the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems.6Willett W Rockström J Loken B et al.Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT–Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems.Lancet. 2019; 393: 447-492Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar This Commission emphasises the importance of a global tilt toward a more plant-based diet both for individual as well as environmental health. But if physicians are not adequately trained in nutrition, how can they take a meaningful role in aiding this dietary shift toward a plant sourced diet so necessary for both personal and planetary health? There is no question that dietary intake, both on an individual and population basis, is a function of a great many inputs including food access, economics, cultural traditions, marketing, and more. Nevertheless, patients generally rely on their physicians for guidance and there is ample evidence that physician discussions of diet make a positive impact on patient dietary choices.7International Food Information Council2018 Food & Health Survey.https://www.foodinsight.org/2018-FHS-Report-FINAL.pdfDate: 2018Date accessed: September 3, 2019Google Scholar As aptly described in the review by Crowley and colleagues \"a poorly trained medical workforce can be viewed in and of itself as one structural contributor to diet-related disease.\"2Crowley JJ Ball L Hiddink GJ Nutrition in medical education: a systematic review.Lancet Plan Health. 2019; 3: e379-e389Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar Also noted in the study, nutritional interventions in medicine are best considered a team effort delivered by a group of health professionals skilled in nutritional care. But without a solid foundation of clinical nutrition knowledge and skills, physicians worldwide are generally not equipped to even begin to have an informed nutrition conversation with their patients and to fully identify opportunities for referral. There is much to learn about the most effective strategies to incorporate nutrition curriculum into medical training. Promising approaches to enhance nutrition education in medical education include integration of nutrition-related topics in lectures on disease pathogenesis and treatment, self-paced online curriculum, teaching kitchens, and greater utilisation of interprofessional education. Identification and training of clinical mentors in nutrition is a key challenge. But what is already crystal clear, is that the worldwide state of nutrition education in medicine is inadequate. Our patients deserve much better. And so does our planet.

Nutrition in medical education: a systematic reviewDespite the centrality of nutrition to healthy lifestyle, medical students are not supported to provide high-quality, effective nutrition care. Medical education can be enhanced by institutional commitment to make nutrition education compulsory in medical training, establishment of nutrition competencies to provide a benchmark for nutrition knowledge and skills to be included in curricula, and supported by funding for innovative curriculum initiatives. These initiatives will improve nutrition in medical training to support future doctors for the 21st century. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "BackgroundIn August, 2017, Myanmar security forces initiated a widespread response against the Rohingya ethnic minority in Northern Rakhine State, displacing thousands of people to Bangladesh. This attack was purportedly in response to attacks committed by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, a non-state insurgent group, on Myanmar police, Border Guard Police, and military posts, killing 12 security personnel on Aug 25, 2017. This study aimed to capture the experiences of the population from all Rohingya hamlets in the Northern Rakhine State who have been displaced to Bangladesh.MethodsA quantitative survey was done among Rohingya leaders displaced to refugee camps in Bangladesh. Community leaders from 590 Rohingya hamlets and eight urban wards provided hamlet-level data on the extent, nature, and perpetrators of the violence in Northern Rakhine State in August, 2017, and the resulting morbidity and mortality.ResultsFrom May 28 to July 25, 2018, 462 (77%) of 604 hamlet leaders reported that the primary reason they and their community members fled was because of violence in their hamlet or in a neighbouring hamlet. 568 (94%) respondents reported that they had experienced destruction in their hamlets, including burning or destruction of fields or farms, homes, and mosques; 531 (89%) of 599 respondents reported violence in their hamlets before flight and 373 (64%) of 586 reported violence against civilians in flight. The main perpetrators of violence included but were not limited to Border Guard Police, Myanmar military, and Rakhine extremists. Of the 531 respondents who reported violence in their hamlets, 408 (77%) reported that military forces used helicopters, 372 (70%) reported military vehicles, and 113 (21%) reported tanks in these assaults on civilian communities. We estimate that 7803 Rohingya died from violent and non-violent causes associated with the August, 2017, attacks and subsequent displacement.InterpretationIn 2017, the Rohingya ethnic minority population of Northern Rakhine State were the targets of a campaign of widespread and systematic violence, including violence by state forces.FundingAn anonymous grant to Physicians for Human Rights.",

    "ab": "The progression of climate change is increasingly recognised as a climate emergency by international advisory bodies and governments worldwide, and there are growing warnings that it will be accompanied by severe health consequences.1European Academies' Science Advisory CouncilThe imperative of climate action to protect human health in Europe.https://easac.eu/publications/details/the-imperative-of-climate-action-to-protect-human-health-in-europe/Date: 2019Date accessed: July 1, 2019Google Scholar, 2Haines A Ebi K The imperative for climate action to protect health.N Engl J Med. 2019; 380: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 3Solomon CG LaRocque RC Climate change – a health emergency.N Engl J Med. 2019; 380: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar During the UN Climate Conference in June, 2019 the UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, called for more ambitious and immediate climate action to meet Paris Agreement targets. The World Conference on Health and Climate Change, organised by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in conjunction with WHO in April, 2019, was an important step in bringing stakeholders together to discuss preparedness and adaptation measures. A combination of mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation measures to adjust to the unavoidable is needed to meet global health needs, particularly given that many mitigation measures also have substantial health co-benefits. The growing attention of decision-makers to the health aspects of climate change is welcome and needed, but the increasing political visibility requires robust evidence to inform urgently needed, meaningful, and sustainable policies without inadvertent consequences. There is mounting evidence of negative consequences of climate change on human health, from both direct and indirect effects, mediated by ecosystems and socioeconomic systems. Direct risks arise from increases in temperature and in the severity and frequency of heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods, and other extreme weather events. Ecosystem-mediated risks are a result of changes in air pollution, allergen exposures, water availability and quality, food and nutrition security, and altered distributions of pathogens, vectors,1European Academies' Science Advisory CouncilThe imperative of climate action to protect human health in Europe.https://easac.eu/publications/details/the-imperative-of-climate-action-to-protect-human-health-in-europe/Date: 2019Date accessed: July 1, 2019Google Scholar, 4Ryan SJ Carlson CJ Mordecai EA Johnson LR Global expansion and redistribution of Aedes-borne virus transmission risk with climate change.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2019; 13e0007213Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar and hosts of infectious diseases. Risks mediated by socioeconomic systems come from forced migration, damage to infrastructure and health services, the economic effects of declining labour productivity (eg, due to rising temperatures), and conflict. In addition to hazard-related injuries, the resultant health effects include diseases communicated by vectors, water, and food; non-communicable diseases, especially cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory illnesses; undernutrition; and violent injuries (arising, for example, from indirect effects of climate change on civil conflict or criminal activity) and death. In addition, there is increasing recognition of mental health consequences of climate change.5Hayes K Bleshki G Wiseman J Burke S Reifals L Climate change and mental health: risks, impacts and priority actions.Int J Ment Health Syst. 2018; 12: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar The groups most vulnerable to climate change related health effects are children, older people, those who are sick, and migrating and marginalised populations. The health effects of climate change are detectable now and risks will increase over time, linked to the magnitude of climate change. However, solutions are attainable, and there are major opportunities to improve public health. A compelling example illustrating the health co-benefits of mitigation is shown by Lelieveld and colleagues,6Lelieveld J Klingmuller K Burnett RT et al.Effects of fossil fuel and total anthropogenic emission removal on public health and climate.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2019; 9: 7192-7197Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar who state that a phase out of fossil fuels would avoid approximately 3·6 million premature deaths per year globally from ambient air pollution at today's population. The global benefit could be up to 5·6 million fewer deaths per year from air pollution if emissions from agriculture and households were also controlled. The health co-benefits of reducing combustion of fossil fuels and agricultural emissions to mitigate climate change were also emphasised in recent statements by national academies of science and medicine.7German National Academy of Sciences LeopoldinaSaubere luft – stickstoffoxide und feinstaub in der atemluft: grundlagen und empfehlungen.https://www.leopoldina.org/publikationen/detailansicht/publication/saubere-luft-stickstoffoxide-und-feinstaub-in-der-atemluft-grundlagen-und-empfehlungen-2019/Date: 2019Date accessed: July 1, 2019Google Scholar, 8Academy of Science of South AfricaBrazilian Academy of SciencesGerman National Academy of Sciences LeopoldinaU.S. National Academy of MedicineU.S. National Academy of SciencesAir pollution and health.

The health risks from climate change originate from a wide range of interconnected causes and consequences, and therefore require broad policy consideration. For example, prolonged heatwaves might result not only in heat-related illnesses and deaths, but also in droughts affecting food and nutrition security, and wildfires causing air pollution. Therefore, there must be explicit consideration of health effects in all policies, ranging from climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies to the development of climate-smart food systems, urban planning, and new options for energy production and transport, and must be linked with the EU's and other (eg, G7 and G20) global policies (panel).PanelThe European Academies' Science Advisory Council (EASAC) policy recommendations for climate change in relation to human healthOn the basis of detailed evaluation of a broad range of scientific evidence with a focus on Europe, the EASAC policy advisory report1European Academies' Science Advisory CouncilThe imperative of climate action to protect human health in Europe.https://easac.eu/publications/details/the-imperative-of-climate-action-to-protect-human-health-in-europe/Date: 2019Date accessed: July 1, 2019Google Scholar reaffirms as an overarching recommendation that the top priority is to urgently stabilise the climate and to increase efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of achieving a zero-carbon economy before 2050. EASAC's recommendations relating to human health can be summarised as follows.Health in all policiesMake the best use of current evidence to develop coherent and coordinated EU policy frameworks that include benefits to health as a major consideration in adaptation and mitigation actions, including the following:•Reform of the EU Adaptation Strategy to increase focus on health consequences of climate change•Health impact assessment to be integrated into all climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies•Development of healthy, climate-smart food systems, with corresponding modifications of the Common Agricultural Policy•Development and promotion of dietary guidelines for sustainable healthy diets, including consideration of when and, if so, how the EU and Member States should use health or environmental criteria, or both, to influence food system policies•Linkage of climate change and health objectives into all key EU domestic policies—eg, for reducing air pollution, and neighbouring country and international development policy initiatives•Strengthen links between EU climate and health policies together with promoting similar policy links with global organisations including WHO, G7 and G20, and with collective action on the Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Health considerations should be integrated into the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Climate Agreement.Fill knowledge gaps through research and integration of data setsAlongside continued commitment to basic research, further research is needed to characterise alternative scenarios, tipping points, and effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, in addition to improved surveillance and linkage between environmental, socioeconomic, and health data.Health-risk communicationRaise awareness of current and potential effects of climate change on health.

Fill knowledge gaps through research and integration of data sets Alongside continued commitment to basic research, further research is needed to characterise alternative scenarios, tipping points, and effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, in addition to improved surveillance and linkage between environmental, socioeconomic, and health data. Health-risk communication Raise awareness of current and potential effects of climate change on health. The scientific community must do more to understand individual and institutional behaviour, counter misinformation and polarisation, and strengthen the response of health services and EU agencies. The necessary policy changes need to be informed by research that integrates environmental, socioeconomic, and health data. A major priority for future research should be the quantification of the evidence for effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation actions, including health-impact assessments, to inform necessary policy changes. For example, cities will be affected more than rural areas by some aspects of climate change (eg, high temperatures due to the heat-island effect, spread of diseases due to high population densities, and threatened water supplies) and must increasingly implement reforms (eg, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and energy and water demand). However, the efficacy of such strategies, why they work, and under what conditions remain poorly understood and require systematic analysis, capitalising on the availability of new evaluation methods.9Lamb WF Creutzig F Callaghan MW Minx JC Learning about urban climate solutions from case studies.Nat Clim Chang. 2019; 9: 279-287Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar We note also the importance of instituting early warning systems—eg, for the spread of infectious disease, extreme weather events, heat, cold, and air pollution, but how effective these systems are in adaptation to climate change is unclear. Early warning systems have high intersectoral relevance, because they not only improve public health but also lower the costs caused by reductions in travel and work performance, and therefore economic output, during pandemics or heatwaves. There is a need to make better use of the evidence already available and to fill knowledge gaps. Transdisciplinary integration of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies in system design and data evaluation is required to identify synergies, unintended consequences, and trade-offs, and to achieve the multifactorial strategies necessary to respond to, and prepare for, climate change. Bringing evidence together will reveal new opportunities to inform action at national and regional levels, to reduce the risks to health, and to gain multiple benefits to health from zero-carbon policies to ensure the wellbeing of current populations without compromising the health of future generations. The recommended rapid and decisive actions described in the EASAC report1European Academies' Science Advisory CouncilThe imperative of climate action to protect human health in Europe.https://easac.eu/publications/details/the-imperative-of-climate-action-to-protect-human-health-in-europe/Date: 2019Date accessed: July 1, 2019Google Scholar (panel) are of core value in tackling multiple Sustainable Development Goals. Until now, the effects of climate change on human health have been relatively neglected in EU policy. The EASAC report welcomes the growing commitment by the European Commission to raise the visibility of problems caused by climate change. But there are still policy disconnects to resolve. We particularly emphasise that a continuing uncertainty on what is an EU-level or what is country-level responsibility on health must not be an obstacle to the urgent action required by all. The scientific community must do more to raise awareness of current and potential effects of climate change on health, to understand individual and institutional behaviour, to counter misinformation and polarisation, and to strengthen the response of health services and EU agencies. EASAC will support action to extend assessment of climate change effects on health to particularly vulnerable territories such as the Arctic region and the Mediterranean. In addition, through the work of the InterAcademy Partnership, the global network of academies of science, medicine, and engineering, EASAC will stimulate further assessment and action worldwide. We declare no competing interests.

    "ab": "On March 22, 2019, the world will celebrate World Water Day, which this year has the theme of leaving no one behind. We argue that an intersectional feminist approach is needed to recognise and mitigate the disproportionate effects of climate change and water scarcity on women, especially marginalised and vulnerable women. Leaving no one behind requires explicitly mainstreaming gender equality within water resources management and climate change adaptation programmes and collection of gender data on their effects to enable evidence-based responses. Water scarcity is a serious and growing problem. 71% of the world's population, or 4·3 billion people, experience moderate to severe water scarcity for at least some part of each year.1Mekonnen MM Hoekstra AY Four billion people facing severe water scarcity.Sci Adv. 2016; 2: e1500323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar This percentage is expected to grow due to climate change, and the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 20192World Economic ForumThe global risks report 2019. World Economic Forum, Geneva2019Google Scholar lists water crises among the top ten risks in terms of both likelihood and effects. Women, especially the poorest women in low-income and middle-income countries, already bear disproportionate responsibility for water-related tasks, including water carrying, cooking, and washing.3Graham JP Hirai M Kim SS An analysis of water collection labor among women and children in 24 sub-saharan african countries.PLoS One. 2016; 11: e0155981Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar The longer water fetching takes, the less likely the carrier is to be male.4Sorenson SB Morssink C Campos PA Safe access to safe water in low income countries: water fetching in current times.Soc Sci Med. 2011; 72: 1522-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar Accompanying these tasks are physical, economic, and psychosocial stresses, which will be exacerbated in situations of increasing water scarcity resulting from climate change.5Bisung E Elliott SJ Psychosocial impacts of the lack of access to water and sanitation in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review.J Water Health. 2017; 15: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Sorensen C Murray V Lemery J Balbus J Climate change and women's health: impacts and policy directions.PLoS Med. 2018; 15: e1002603Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar The water sector has historically been gender-blind, meaning that it has not always considered gender differences. In 2007, Ray7Ray I Women, water, and development.Annu Rev Environ Resour. 2007; 32: 421-449Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar aimed to combine evidence on water and women but found research to be scarce, prompting a call for sex-disaggregated data to enable consideration of women and girls in water-related policies and programmes. Studies have increasingly identified gendered needs and health effects related to water and climate change, but these studies have yet to result in widespread action.5Bisung E Elliott SJ Psychosocial impacts of the lack of access to water and sanitation in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review.J Water Health. 2017; 15: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Sorensen C Murray V Lemery J Balbus J Climate change and women's health: impacts and policy directions.PLoS Med. 2018; 15: e1002603Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar Programmes and initiatives focused on the integration of water resources management and climate change adaptation now have an opportunity to mainstream gender, such that their interventions will not only address water scarcity but will promote gender equality and empowerment. What would promotion of gender equality and empowerment in relation to water look like? At a minimum, it would necessitate a recognition of gender differences, as opposed to gender blindness. This requires collection of improved gender data. At the global level, an opportunity exists to enable sex-disaggregated data collection through the WHO and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, which is revising core questions for monitoring household water, sanitation, and hygiene.8WHO, UNICEFCore questions. Joint Monitoring Programme.https://washdata.org/monitoring/methods/core-questionsDate: 2018Date accessed: February 7, 2019Google Scholar This effort should include questions to assess differences in responsibilities for water-related tasks—including but not limited to drinking water—based on gender as well as on age, socioeconomic status, and other characteristics, such as caste, as part of an intersectional approach. Researchers similarly can contribute to improved gender data in studies of water resource management and climate change adaptation. This work should be grounded in recognition of the intrinsic importance of women and girls. In other words, quantifying the gendered effects of climate change in relation to water is important because women and girls are intrinsically important. Too often, past research has instead been grounded in a view of women as instruments for the wellbeing of children and other family members.9Pickering AJ Davis J Freshwater availability and water fetching distance affect child health in sub-Saharan Africa.Environ Sci Tech. 2012; 46: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar Research into the effects of climate change and water scarcity on the health and wellbeing of women, not only on their children, is desperately needed. Programmes that integrate water resource management and climate change adaptation can adopt a mainstreaming approach, in which gender differences are considered in all aspects of the programme. Gender mainstreaming needs to be done from the design phase, so gender differences and gender equality goals can be incorporated from the beginning. Women must be actively involved in this process. As Yadav and Lal10Yadav SS Lal R Vulnerability of women to climate change in arid and semi-arid regions: the case of India and South Asia.J Arid Environ. 2018; 149: 4-17Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar note, women and girls are not passive victims of climate change, but rather proactive and experienced agents with expertise in adaptation and mitigation in the face of climate change. They must also be included in the creation of indicators to monitor and evaluate the effects of such programmes. To this end, a pressing need exists for validated tools to measure gender equality and empowerment in programmes focused on water and climate change. As the world works to address the water-related effects of climate change, leaving no one behind is indeed important. A special focus is therefore needed on the most marginalised and vulnerable populations, starting with women and girls. These efforts can then be a vehicle for not only improving human health and protecting the environment but for transforming lives. Gender equality can be a focus now, and programmes can and should adopt a gender mainstreaming approach immediately. We declare no competing interests.",

    "ab": "BackgroundLittle data exist to describe the use and medical consequences of drone strikes on civilian populations in war and conflict zones. Gaza is a landstrip within the Palestinian territories and the home of 2 million people. The median age in Gaza is 17·2 years and almost half of the population is below the age of 14 years. We studied the prevalence and severity of extremity amputation injuries caused by drone strikes compared with those caused by other explosive weapons among patients with amputations attending the main physical prosthesis and rehabilitation centre in Gaza.MethodsIn this retrospective cross-sectional study, we recruited patients from the Artificial Limb and Polio Centre (ALPC) in Gaza city in the Gaza strip with conflict-related traumatic extremity amputations. Patients were eligible if they had one or more amputations sustained during a military incursion in Gaza during 2006–16 and had an available patient record. Each patient completed a self-reporting questionnaire of the time and mechanism of injury, subsequent surgeries, comorbidities, and their socioeconomic status, and we collected each patient's medical history, recorded the anatomical location of their amputation or amputations, and interviewed each patient to obtain a detailed description of the incursion or incursions that led to their amputation injury. We classified the severity of amputations and number of subsequent surgeries on ordinal scales and then we determined the associations between these outcomes and the mechanism of explosive weapon delivery (drone strike vs other) using ordinal logistical regression.FindingsWe collected data on 254 patients from APLC who had sustained an amputation injury. Of these patients, 234 (92%) were male and 43 (17%) were aged 18 years or younger at the time of injury. The age of participants was representative of the Gaza population, with a median age at inclusion was 28 years (IQR 23–33), and the median age at the time of injury was 23 years (IQR 20–29). 136 (54%) amputation injuries were caused by explosive weapons delivered by drone strikes, with explosives delivered by tanks being the next most common source of amputation injury (28 [11%]). Adjusted for age and sex, drone-delivered weapons caused significantly more severe injuries than explosives delivered by other mechanisms (eg, military jet airplanes, helicopters, tank shelling, and naval artillery; odds ratio [OR] 2·50, 95% CI 1·52–4·11; p=0·0003). Compared with all other types of weapons, the patients whose injuries were caused by drone strikes needed significantly more subsequent surgical operations to treat their amputation injuries than those injured by other weapons (OR 1·93, 1·19–3·14; p=0·008).InterpretationDrone strikes were the most commonly reported cause of amputation injury in our study population and were associated with more severe injuries and more additional surgeries than injuries caused by other explosive weapons. Limitations of our study include the self-reported nature of the mechanism of injury and number of subsequent surgeries and selection bias from not incorporating amputation injuries from individuals who died immediately or due to complications. The increasing use of drones needs to be addressed, rather than passively accepted, by the international community. This study fills a gap in our knowledge of the civilian consequences of modern warfare and we believe it is also relevant to the growing populations that are being exposed to drone warfare and for health-care personnel treating these people.FundingNone.",

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2015Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar Experts7Wright C Nyberg D Climate change, capitalism, and corporations. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2015Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar have exposed the limitations of such initiatives, which lie in the fundamental tension between the profit-maximising drive of corporations and the need for a profound decarbonisation of commercial and economic sectors (eg, energy, transportation, manufacturing) that would advance human health. Believing that a life-threatening paradigm can be reversed by the same system, means, and actors that caused it in the first place—ie, relying on business and market logic to reorient the course of climate change—is naive, ineffectual, and irresponsible. Such crucial conditions call, rather, for radical measures. To improve planetary health and produce healthy livelihoods around the world, solutions must be sought outside the wealth logic mechanisms of corporations. We aim to spark discussion on creative thinking and effective action to protect and promote our most important collective good: planetary health. We propose a framework for countering the effects of corporate power and commercial determinants of health (appendix). This framework is based on the current state of scientific knowledge, inspired by the frameworks of the Canadian Association of Public Health on ecological determinants of health9Canadian Public Health AssociationGlobal change and public health: addressing the ecological determinants of health.https://www.cpha.ca/sites/default/files/assets/policy/edh-discussion_e.pdfDate: May, 2015Date accessed: November 25, 2015Google Scholar and of the commercial determinants of health defined by Kickbusch and colleagues.4Kickbusch I Allen L Franz C The commercial determinants of health.Lancet Glob Health. 2016; 4: e895-e896Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar Here we provide strategies for transitioning societies towards a socioecological economic model. First, regulatory restrictions on carbon emissions and pollution should be established and enforced.7Wright C Nyberg D Climate change, capitalism, and corporations. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2015Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar Furthermore, new economic and social development models should be implemented that reflect the importance of sustainable environments.10Brousselle A Butzbach C Redesigning public health for planetary health.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e188-e189Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar Degrowth, among others, could be considered. Regulatory and transparent funding mechanisms should be established for elections and political campaigns; politicians should engage in a politics of climate change that offers a future for their constituents, undeterred by corporate influence, and common interests for planetary health should take precedence. Additionally, a series of concerted intersectoral and interdisciplinary efforts and collaborations mobilising researchers, politicians, health practitioners, and others who have an effect on health outcomes through their actions should be encouraged and brought into the mainstream. The political role of the public health sector should be reclaimed and strengthened.10Brousselle A Butzbach C Redesigning public health for planetary health.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e188-e189Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar Health institutions must reclaim their political role in protecting and promoting planetary health. The case against tobacco corporations illustrates the positive influence of such a political role. Similarly, carbon exit success stories could be used as precedents to counterbalance commercial determinants of health. These levers should be considered seriously when challenging one of the most important determinants of health—commercial and corporate power—to preserve and promote human and planetary health.

    "ab": "The global food system is causing unsustainable pressures on the environment, leading to widespread land use change, increased greenhouse gas emissions, disruption of the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, biodiversity loss, and freshwater depletion and pollution.1Steffen W Richardson K Rockström J et al.Planetary boundaries: guiding human development on a changing planet.Science. 2015; 347: 1259855Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar, 2Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar Environmental pressures are mounting as populations grow and diets change, escalating the need to make food production and consumption more sustainable. Yet, there are limitations in the current analysis of global food system sustainability. We believe there are four main areas that could be improved to make such analysis more comprehensive and insightful. These improvements could have important repercussions on the development of effective evidence-based policy that ultimately promotes production efficiencies and sustainable diets. One set of opportunities for improvement in the analysis of food system sustainability relates to the robustness of the dietary scenarios that are modelled. First, these scenarios need to be made more plausible. Although assessment of radical shifts in human diets might be useful in highlighting the effects of animal-based versus plant-based foods, we question the benefit of emphasising the most extreme of scenarios (ie, a complete switch from omnivore to vegetarian or vegan diets), when the foreseeable global trend is heading strongly in the opposite direction.2Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar In addition, analyses of these extreme diet substitution scenarios tend to focus on greenhouse gas emissions, but in such scenarios, trade-offs between sustainability indicators are highly likely—aptly highlighted by the increased use of water in scenarios that model shifts from grass-fed livestock towards water-intensive crops.3Muller A Schader C Efficiency, sufficiency, and consistency for sustainable healthy food.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e13-e14Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar We argue that it is more insightful to model ambitious yet achievable, context-specific reductions in animal products, overconsumption (particularly of discretionary foods), and food waste, in line with those recently recommended by the EAT-Lancet Commission on sustainable food systems for overall planetary health.4Willett W Rockström J Loken B et al.Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT–Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems.Lancet. 2019; (published online Jan 16.)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31788-4Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3424) Google Scholar Secondly, more granular and dynamic analyses are needed. Estimates of environmental effects underpinning global food system analyses are typically based on life cycle assessment, an environmental accounting framework that captures effects from farm-to-fork. While the rigour and comprehensiveness of available life cycle assessment data and associated meta-analyses are improving and encompassing important trade-offs between sustainability objectives,5Poore J Nemecek T Reducing food's environmental impacts through producers and consumers.Science. 2018; 360: 987-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar significant shortcomings remain, notably in terms of low commodity-level detail and the use of global averages to infer region-specific or nation-specific environmental intensities (defined in life cycle assessments as the impact per functional unit of production). In addition, most life cycle assessments are static, and therefore do not represent system feedbacks that incorporate changes in demand because of production efficiency enhancements, or marginal changes in environmental effects involved in large-scale dietary shifts—such as when animal-based products are completely eliminated. The quantification of these dynamics and their system-wide environmental impacts is an opportunity to greatly improve sustainability assessments of different food products and proposed substitutions. Thirdly, protein sources beyond conventional livestock need greater consideration. In many parts of the world, alternative animal protein sources such as abundant native species that are better adapted to local conditions (eg, kangaroo in Australia and deer in the northern hemisphere) can contribute to human nutrition, with such sourcing having considerably lower environmental effects than farming of conventional livestock.6Machovina B Feeley KJ Ripple WJ Biodiversity conservation: the key is reducing meat consumption.Sci Total Environ. 2015; 536: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar Many countries are also host to introduced feral animal populations that could serve as alternative protein sources—for example, Australia has substantial feral deer, goat, rabbit, pig, horse, and camel populations. Partly replacing existing mainstream protein sources with wild harvests of these alternative sources could achieve co-benefits for the environment (eg, through reducing emissions, land degradation, and the effects on native biodiversity), and improve human health, since game meat is typically leaner than lamb and beef.7Wilson GR Edwards MJ Native wildlife on rangelands to minimize methane and produce lower-emission meat: kangaroos versus livestock.Conserv Lett. 2008; 1: 119-128Crossref Google Scholar Conventional analyses also fail to account for other transformative shifts in animal-sourced protein, such as those towards laboratory-grown meat, insect-derived protein, and feeding animals on ecological leftovers such as food waste or grass from pastures.8Röös E Bajželj B Smith P Patel M Little D Garnett T Greedy or needy? Land use and climate impacts of food in 2050 under different livestock futures.Glob Environ Change. 2017; 47: 1-12Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar Including potential shifts to novel low-impact protein sources would ensure more comprehensive modelling of the associated environmental effects. Finally, analyses should better quantify the diverse effects of food production on biodiversity and ecosystems. Food production contributes considerably to species extinction, which has detrimental effects on many ecosystems and plant and animal communities that are essential for supporting human life.2Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar Yet, there is an overreliance on proxy indicators such as land use when assessing terrestrial food systems.5Poore J Nemecek T Reducing food's environmental impacts through producers and consumers.Science. 2018; 360: 987-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar Previous research has highlighted how the extent of agricultural land area is not a good proxy for biodiversity impact, because of differences in production intensity and heterogeneity in biodiversity values.9Chaudhary A Gustafson D Mathys A Multi-indicator sustainability assessment of global food systems.Nat Commun. 2018; 9: 848Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar This limited analysis also extends to marine and freshwater food production. Stock depletion, bycatch, and habitat modification or loss, resulting from intensive aquaculture and fishing practices such as trawling, have substantial effects on the biodiversity of coastal and oceanic ecosystems. However, although some studies have considered the environmental intensities of aggregate categories such as farmed fish and crustaceans,6Machovina B Feeley KJ Ripple WJ Biodiversity conservation: the key is reducing meat consumption.Sci Total Environ. 2015; 536: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar the effect of fishing on wild stocks is typically not encompassed in life cycle assessments, despite appropriate data being available.10Woods JS Veltman K Huijbregts MAJ Verones F Hertwich EG Towards a meaningful assessment of marine ecological impacts in life cycle assessment (LCA).Environ Int. 2016; 89–90: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar Integration of a more diverse range of biodiversity indicators into the assessment of food system sustainability would allow for more meaningful analyses. Taking advantage of the opportunities outlined here could facilitate a more complete understanding of the environmental effects of food production and consumption. Embracing these advances is a key prerequisite for developing effective policy recommendations. Our recommendations aim to foster a more comprehensive and nuanced debate on sustainable diets and the food system within the context of global environmental limits.

The question from the former group is simple enough, as people are naturally going to be curious about a term that has yet to enter everyday speech, while the latter is slightly less obvious, although still understandable with a little more thought. Put simply, people like to know what they are doing, and by expounding their own views on the nature of planetary health, researchers have been able to make this clear to themselves and their peers.",

Nature lovers admire its vibrant effect on colourful sunsets, and environmental physicists appreciate its protective effect from solar radiation and its marine biogeochemical cycling. Nevertheless, its intrusions have been a cause of global concern in recent times, owing to air pollution and its associated health risks. Besides minerals, it also transports hydrocarbons, allergens, and microbial compounds from Africa. Airborne microorganisms can increase ten-fold in the Caribbean atmosphere on days with a lot of Saharan dust.4Griffin DW Garrison VH Herman JR Shinn EA African desert dust in the Caribbean atmosphere: microbiology and public health.Aerobiologia. 2001; 17: 203-213Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar The existence and health effects of Sahara dust are well known in nearby European countries.

Dust transportation from the Sahara desert is not restricted to adjacent countries. Between 2007 and 2013, NASA's Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation satellite collected data showing that wind and weather pick up, on average, 182 million tonnes of dust each year and carry it past the western edge of the Sahara, from where it travels 1600 miles across the Atlantic Ocean,7Gray E NASA satellite reveals how much Saharan dust feeds Amazon's plants.https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-satellite-reveals-how-much-saharan-dust-feeds-amazon-s-plantsDate: Feb 22, 2015Date accessed: March 28, 2019Google Scholar leading to annual PM10 concentrations exceeding the US national ambient air quality standards of 150 μg/m3 near the eastern coast of South America, over the Amazon basin and over the Caribbean Sea.8Ozer P Laghdaf MBOM Lemine SOM et al.Estimation of air quality degradation due to Saharan dust at Nouakchott, Mauritania, from horizontal visibility data.Water Air Soil Pollut. 2007; 178: 79-87Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar Such increased trans-Atlantic intrusions were also seen in the 1910s to 1940s and the 1970s to 1980s,9Evan AT Flamant C Gaetani M Guichard F The past, present and future of African dust.Nature. 2016; 531: 493-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar especially during warmer months with increased atmospheric temperatures and low humidity levels. Increasing exposure to Saharan dust plumes has been reported in the southern Caribbean region. A meandering polar jet stream transporting Sahara Desert dust from the North African cyclonic events to the Arctic circle has also been noted by researchers. According to UNEP, the increase in the frequency and severity of dust storms is due to climate change, drought, land degradation, and unsustainable management of land and water resources.3More action needed on sand and dust stormsUnited Nations Environment Programme.https://www.unenvironment.org/es/node/331Date: 2016Date accessed: March 27, 2019Google Scholar Professor Kerry Cook from The University of Texas states that the increased surface temperature (two to four times greater than that of the tropical mean temperature for 1979–2012) and decreasing wintertime cold air surge activity of the Sahara desert are the likely causes of the increased Sahara dust intrusion pattern.10Cook KH Vizy EK Detection and analysis of an amplified warming of the Sahara Desert.J Clim. 2015; 28: 6560-6580Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar In addition to increased asthma attacks in children in the Caribbean linked to Sahara dust, studies from western Atlantic countries have also claimed associations with increased incidence of meningococcal meningitis and cancer. Evidence on the deleterious effects of Sahara dust on plants and animals, especially birds, and erosive effects on the aviation industry are scarce. Findings on its influence on the climate are imprecise, particularly on tropical cyclone activity. The overall economic impact of long-distance Saharan dust ride is unknown. One thing that remains certain is that Sahara dust diminishes air quality and has been linked to increased mortality and morbidity at higher concentrations. Satellite monitoring, trans-Atlantic air quality surveillance and early warnings, and reforestation can reduce its effect on human health. If efforts are made to reduce the human-made sources of particulate matter concentrations, the adverse effects of natural causes might be diminished, if not eliminated.

    "ab": "BackgroundWhile many studies suggest there are health benefits of urban green space, relatively few have explored potential for prevention of major non-communicable diseases. Those which have tend to rely on cross-sectional data that is vulnerable to reverse causation and also typically focus on total green space, rather than attempt to tease out which type of green space matters most; a key question among urban planners. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine whether urban green space in total, and tree canopy specifically, plays a protective role in prevention of heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes.MethodsIncident doctor diagnosed heart disease, hypertension and diabetes were measured in a residentially stable sample of 46 786 city-dwellers in the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study (baseline 2006–09; follow-up 2012–15). The odds of incident outcomes were measured in association with total green space and tree canopy within 1·6 km road network buffers using multilevel models adjusted for confounding. These analyses were replicated to check for associations with prevalent outcomes.FindingsThe odds of incident heart disease (odds ratio 0·78, 95% CI 0·65–0·93), hypertension (0·83, 0·72–0·96), and diabetes (0·69, 0·54–0·85) were lower among people with ≥30% tree canopy, compared to 0–9% tree canopy. Evidence was also found to suggest lower odds of prevalent heart disease (0·85, 0·75–0·95), hypertension (0·87, 0·78–0·96), and diabetes (0·62, 0·52–0·75) with ≥30% tree canopy compared with 0–9% tree canopy. Total green space ≥30% compared to 0–4% was associated with lower odds of prevalent diabetes only (0·72, 0·52–0·98).InterpretationThis longitudinal study adds further support for urban greening, and restoration and conservation of urban tree canopy in particular, to be considered as a non-health sector-led strategy for non-communicable disease prevention.FundingThe Hort Frontiers Green Cities Fund and the National Health and Medical Research Council.",

Other nutrition targets are also being missed and the review notes that climate extremes and variability are threatening to reduce and reverse previous gains made in food security. Poor diet is a factor in a fifth of deaths around the world.2GBD 2016 Causes of Death CollaboratorsGlobal, regional, and national age-sex specific mortality for 264 causes of death, 1980–2016: a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016.Lancet. 2017; 390: 1151-1210Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar In a previous Comment,3Fears R ter Meulen V von Braun J Scientific opportunities for food and nutrition security.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e2-e3Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar we introduced a project done by the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP)—a global network of science academies—that sought to bring together four regional academy networks from Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe, so as to provide new impetus to the analysis of shared opportunities and challenges in food and nutrition security and agriculture. This project covers malnutrition in all of its forms: undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight and obesity. Our global focus derived from three key perspectives framing the overall scope: (1) the role of science in strengthening and safeguarding international public goods, that is, those goods and services that have to be provided on a scale that is beyond the effort of individual countries; (2) the need to clarify and tackle international environmental and institutional risks, and prevent transmission of these risks; and (3) the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which provide an essential policy framework, but need underpinning by scientific endeavour to elucidate their complexities and interactions. Scientific research has already contributed greatly to the efficiency of agriculture and food systems,4Beachy RN Building political and financial support for science and technology for agriculture.Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2014; 369: 20120274Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar but much more is needed from across the scientific disciplines. Technical and social understanding of the opportunities and risks should be concurrent. Since the publication of the previous Comment, the four regional academy network reports have been completed. These reports, together with feedback from the wider scientific community on our progress—documented in The Lancet Planetary Health3Fears R ter Meulen V von Braun J Scientific opportunities for food and nutrition security.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e2-e3Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar and elsewhere—have served as a rich resource for our completion of a fifth global analysis and synthesis report. This report was published in November, 2018, and advises on those matters that should be addressed in collaborative and interconnected ways. The objectives for global sharing and coherence bring challenges for the science and innovation communities, but also mandate a reform of policy making to enable food systems to deliver sustainable healthy diets for all. We are aware, of course, that many other fine reports are available on the issues that IAP covers. Why, then, despite advances in the natural and social sciences, do the risks for food and nutrition security continue to increase? The challenges for the functioning of food systems are complex and require transformative solutions that systematically use the knowledge that is already available, together with filling knowledge gaps by new research. We see that the potential power of the IAP contribution in providing added value to the large body of work already undertaken by others—both in terms of scholarship and in translating precepts to practice—resides in the distinctive features of the project, in multiple respects. These novel project attributes include: (1) representing the combined global resources of more than 130 academies of science and medicine to provide evidence-based advice; (2) being inclusive, based on regional expertise across multiple scientific disciplines, together with its emphasis on the central importance of basic research; (3) capitalising on core values of academies in their being free of vested interests, having open processes, and being accountable; (4) use of a common starting point on priority themes, to bring order to a wide diversity of evidence, and then integrating conclusions to link national, regional, and global perspectives; (5) taking a food systems approach to encompass all of the steps involved from growing food through to its processing, trading, and consumption; (6) recognising that setting priorities for increasing agricultural production should take account of the pressures on other vital natural resources, particularly water, soil, and energy;5von Braun J Gulati A Kharas H Key policy actions for sustainable land use and water use to serve people.Economics. 2017; 11: 1-14Google Scholar and (7) identifying when consensus on controversial issues arises, or when further work is required to clarify and resolve differing views, while embracing diversities in agriculture and food systems and in political systems. Our fifth report's detailed global recommendations are summarised briefly in the panel: in our set of reports we also discuss the essential interactions required between regional and global policy makers. The core global priorities for generating and using scientific opportunities cover: sustainable food and nutrition systems; transformation to healthy diets; food production and usage issues; interconnections between food, energy, water, and health; and augmenting effective interaction at the science–policy interfaces, including through international science advisory mechanisms. In addition to the specific priorities listed in the panel, cross-cutting priorities are evident for capacity building and collaboration in science. Agriculture and food systems are vital for achieving the SDGs, and any engagement between the scientific community, policy makers, and other stakeholders needs to inspire, coordinate, and scale-up commitment to regional and transregional research and innovation, and to mobilise resources generally needed for such research and innovation. Academies understand that there is a collective imperative among the scientific community to be more ambitious in identifying and using the scientific opportunities for systems in transition in an uncertain and increasingly connected world.PanelRecommendations from the InterAcademy Partnership on international scientific priorities for food and nutrition securityDeveloping sustainable diets by taking an integrative food systems perspective to deliver health and wellbeing, linked to transformation towards the circular economy and bioeconomyResearch priorities include new opportunities in food processing and reduction of food losses, and for ensuring international market resilience.Enabling transformation to a healthy diet and good nutritionResearch priorities include how to influence consumer behaviour and private sector actions towards healthy food choices, and delineating and quantifying health co-benefits of climate change mitigation.Understanding food production and utilisation issues, covering considerations of efficacy, sustainability, climate risks, and diversity of resourcesResearch priorities include assessment of new farming structures, and options for neglected and new food and feed sources.Capitalising on opportunities coming within range in the biosciences and other rapidly advancing sciencesResearch priorities include improving plant and animal breeding techniques, and clarifying how technology can augment precision agriculture.Addressing the linkages between food, nutrition, energy, water, and healthResearch priorities include assessments of trade-offs between different ecosystem services, and the management of transboundary risks.Promoting activity at the science–policy interfaces and reconciling policy disconnectsFor example, in relation to the transregional challenges for capacity building in the generation and sharing of research, the promotion of public–private partnerships, and the introduction of flexible and proportionate regulation of innovation.Consolidating and coordinating international science advisory mechanismsForming an international panel for food and nutrition security and agriculture could support international governance mechanisms and evidence-based policy formulation within a coherent strategic framework.

Consolidating and coordinating international science advisory mechanisms Forming an international panel for food and nutrition security and agriculture could support international governance mechanisms and evidence-based policy formulation within a coherent strategic framework. For example, increasing forecasts are being made of the various negative effects of climate change on food systems, necessitating the introduction of climate-smart agriculture. However, agriculture itself contributes substantially to negative environmental effects and climate change.6Poore J Nemecek T Reducing food's environmental impacts through producers and consumers.Science. 2018; 360: 987-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar Mitigating this contribution depends on the introduction of climate-smart food systems but also on efforts to influence consumer behaviour associated with excessive greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, and to reduce food waste. Changing dietary patterns that are problematic, particularly in terms of overconsumption of calories and excess intake of meat products, could bring co-benefits to health and well-being, the climate, and other ecosystem-dependent services. Giving these issues higher prominence is essential in international discussions of the SDGs—eg, in the 2019 UN High-Level Political Forum on SDG 13 (climate action). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, also forthcoming in 2019, on climate change and land, which includes discussions on food security and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems, is anticipated to be an important milestone in attracting political attention. What's next? Our aim has been to make our recommendations policy-relevant but not overly policy-prescriptive. Academies and their networks remain highly committed to using the outputs from our work in debates with the wider science and policy communities, in exploring how to identify, characterise, and provide sustainable healthy diets. Recently, the project regional outputs were communicated to a meeting organised by the Science 20 (also known as S20) group as part of the G20 discussion hosted by Argentina, the G20 president for 2018. We are currently active in capitalising on additional opportunities (for example in the 2018 World Health Summit to stimulate discussion and action across sectors and we welcome feedback on the issues covered and on new directions that could be pursued.

    "ab": "BackgroundBuruli ulcer is the third most common mycobacterial disease worldwide. The public health burden of this neglected tropical disease is large, particularly in poor areas of west and central Africa. The development of appropriate preventive strategies is hampered by an incomplete understanding of the epidemiology and transmission of the disease. We investigated the effect of the drilling of wells on Buruli ulcer incidence.MethodsIn this case-control, quantitative survey, we obtained field data for Buruli ulcer incidence over a 10-year period from a specialised centre that collected data for the Ouémé and Plateau departments in Benin, and data for well drilling from the Ministry of Energy, Water and Mines in Benin. The coordinates of the wells drilled were obtained during site visits. A case-control study was then done to investigate the role of well water use in protecting against Buruli ulcer.FindingsWe found a strong inverse correlation between the incidence of Buruli ulcer and the number of new wells drilled in the Bonou municipality (r2=0·8818). A case-control study (106 cases and 212 controls) showed that regular use of the water from the wells for washing, bathing, drinking, or cooking was protective against Buruli ulcer (adjusted odds ratio 0·1, 95% CI 0·04–0·44; p=0·0012).InterpretationThis study opens up new possibilities for developing an effective yet affordable policy to fight the disease on a substantial geographical scale. Our study shows that providing access to protected water is an efficient and feasable way to reduce the incidence of Buruli ulcer.FundingFondation Francaise Raoul Follereau, French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, and Région Pays de Loire.",

    "ab": "India is once again at the centre of heated discussions due to its toxic air and the disproportionately high mortality and disease burden this is causing. In November, the air in Delhi, India's capital, was so noxious that authorities declared a public health emergency and ordered the closure of schools in the city and surrounding suburbs for several days. All dirty fuel-based industries—ie, those powered by coal and diesel—were also ordered to be closed by the Supreme Court mandated Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority. Delhi's toxic air, choked with smoke, partly from farm fires in neighbouring states, industrial and vehicular pollution, and road dust, is familiar to all those who live in the city. The toxicity shoots up every winter due to several factors, including lower wind speeds, festival fireworks and crop residue burning by farmers in neighbouring states. Despite the well-documented health impacts, the situation has not improved. A recent study showed that India's toxic air—particulate matter and household air pollution—claimed 1·24 million lives in 2017. That is 12·5% of the deaths recorded that year in India. Delhi was shown to have the highest level of annual population-weighted mean PM2·5 (particulate matter of diameter <2·5 μm) pollution in 2017, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Haryana in north India, all with mean values greater than 125 μg/m3. Delhi's toxic air regularly makes front page news, but the problem is much more widespread. For example, a 2018 report on the worlds most polluted cities noted that “of the cities included in South Asia… although Delhi typically receives most media coverage as one of the world's ‘pollution capitals’… [it] ‘only’ ranks 10th for annual PM2·5 concentration. Other cities across Northern India and Pakistan have a higher recorded annual PM2·5 level, with nearby Gurugram narrowly resulting in the highest annual concentration of any global city recorded during 2018.” In 2018, the average air pollution level in Gurugram was over 13 times the WHO guidelines. Polluted air does not impact everyone equally; the poor and those forced to work outdoors suffer more. A 2011 paper which investigated the human health impacts from urban air pollution in India concluded that such pollution is especially harmful to poor people. “About 74% of the population with low income is exposed to annual 24-hourly average PM10 concentration levels above 150 μg/m3, compared to about 58% each for those with medium or high income. The safe level standards for residential areas are up to 60 μg/m3”, the paper noted. More affluent Indians are now seeking to protect themselves by installing air purifiers, remaining indoors in more “protected air” and venturing outdoors with masks on. In contrast, a cycle-rickshaw ride through the Rajendra Nagar Industrial area in Ghaziabad, adjacent to Delhi, gave a glimpse of the risks faced by extremely poor Indians, working outdoors, with few other work choices and no protection. Vijay Singh, around 40, knows it is a tough life pedalling a rickshaw through some of the most polluted patches of the city. “Yes, I have breathing problems. It is getting worse. I cough a lot. I don't go to a doctor unless I feel really bad. I can't afford to take time off. I don't feel comfortable wearing a mask when I cycle. I know the air is very polluted here, but what can I do?” Singh told The Lancet Planetary Health. Dr Arvind Kumar, a chest surgeon at Delhi's Ganga Ram Hospital and chairperson of the NGO the Lung Care Foundation, explains that “Air pollution affects anyone and everyone who breathes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a sweeper on the street, both breathe about 25 000 times a day. However, the economic difference allows one to control the quality of air that goes into one's lungs. An economically deprived person living in a shack or by the roadside has no access to any technology device which can in any way influence the quality of air.” “Air purifiers can help some people, to some extent but at a heavy cost and no one can remain locked up in air purified rooms 24/7. Air purifiers have mechanical filters which need to be replaced if the ambient air is too dirty. This is expensive and furthermore, domestic air purifiers can't deal with noxious gases, only particulate matter”, says Kumar. In cities with clean air, cycling is healthy. But not so in polluted cities. Rahul Goel, lead author of a 2015 study concerned with on-road PM2·5 pollution exposure in Delhi, says “We found that a person who is cycling or in an auto rickshaw is exposed to 2·5 times more particulate matter (PM2·5) pollution than someone who is in an air conditioned car with the windows rolled up or someone who is travelling in an air conditioned train. It gets worse if you factor in the physical exertion involved in cycling, for example. When you are cycling, you inhale up to three times more air. So, for the same distance travelled, a cyclist inhales a total dose of polluted air eight times more than someone in an air conditioned car.” “Location of residence also plays an important role” explains Giridhar Babu, Professor of Lifecourse Epidemiology, at the Indian Institute of Public Health, Pubic Health Foundation (PHFI). Urban dwelling poor communities usually live in close proximity to highly industrialised or commercial locations resulting in greater exposure to industrial pollution at home as well as at work. “Air pollution in India is restricted neither to Delhi, nor winters, nor even cities. Over 99% of the population lives in regions above the WHO recommended annual level of 10 μg/m3 of PM2·5. This figure drops to 83% when seen from the Indian national standards of 40 μg/m3. The Indo Gangetic plain in Northern India is particularly badly affected, with 98% of the population living in areas above the national standard”, according to Dr Santosh Harish, a Research Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research. “Protective approaches are put into use only during spikes and when pollution becomes visible. We are now exposed to bad air almost throughout the year and hence exposure levels across the society tend to be the same. The middle class and the rich may be able to delay the impact but cannot prevent it”, added Dr Gunjan Taneja, National Technical Lead in the USAID-supported VRIDDHI programme which addresses Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A). There are multiple sources of air pollution: household combustion of polluting fuels (for cooking primarily, but also for space and water heating and lamps), power plants and industry, vehicles, waste burning, road and construction dust and episodic sources like crop residue burning. From satellite data and chemical transport modelling-derived estimates of pollutant concentrations, it is known that rural areas also experience high levels of pollution. However, there is negligible monitoring of air quality levels in rural areas. Unequal exposure to polluted air happens at various levels, both indoors and outdoors. “Household air pollution is a complex interplay of gender, poverty, energy access and traditional preferences”, points out CPR's Harish. “The end result is that rural women and young children face particularly high levels of exposure indoors, especially those from poor households. Then there is occupational exposure: labourers on construction sites, in industries, drivers, road cleaners. The homeless population is especially badly affected.” Gunjan Taneja adds “Children and older adults, individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, or genetic polymorphisms are at increased risk of air pollution-related health effects. The differential impact is also due to the type of pollutant one is exposed to. For instance, exposure to particulate matter and ground level ozone is more dangerous. Children are at greatest risk from exposure to ozone because their lungs are still developing and they are more likely to be active outdoors when ozone levels are high.” Biomass combustion, fugitive emissions from unpaved roads, agriculture crop residue burning (ACRB), and brick kilns are the main causes of air pollution in rural India. During ACRB periods, diurnal averaged ambient PM2·5 levels in rural India were reported to go up to around 125 μg/m3, which is more than twice the 60 μg/m3 limit prescribed by India's Central Pollution Control Board. India's Supreme Court stepped in to tackle air pollution and set up a committee of experts with the power to order the closure of factories, schools and so on, in a graded manner. That is an emergency response, like state governments imposing fines on a few farms caught burning rice straw. While everyone talks of the need for more systemic solutions, coal-fired power plants—mostly state-owned—keep telling the Supreme Court that they need more time to install pollution control equipment. Central and state governments have tried to introduce and educate farmers about best practices in agricultural waste management. “Particularly in the states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab, stringent measures have been taken by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to limit the crop residue burning”, says Babu. But the burning goes on. The Supreme Court is now looking at a government proposal to install large air purifiers in Delhi—the so-called smog towers—though they have been found to be of very limited use in cities such as Beijing. Many environmentalists are against the proposal. Rahul Goel of the University of Cambridge said, “What we need is strict vehicle emission norms like the Bharat Stage VI-fuel (BS-VI) which has been rolled out in the National Capital Region recently. But this is not a transport problem alone. To reduce high levels of exposure to pollution on the roads, we need multi-sectoral reductions in emissions. Introduction of stricter emission norms brings more sustained reductions in emissions than knee-jerk decisions of banning certain types of vehicles.”",

Exploring this heterogeneity, in The Lancet Planetary Health, the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Air Pollution Collaborators,5India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Air Pollution CollaboratorsThe impact of air pollution on deaths, disease burden, and life expectancy across the states of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e26-e39Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar present a comprehensive analysis of exposure to air pollution, covering 31 geographical units of India, as part of the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017. They show that ambient air pollution and ambient ozone air pollution concentrations have escalated, whereas household air pollution has declined in most but not all states. Furthermore, death and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to air pollution and the potential gain in life expectancy if global and national limits were adhered to were estimated. Most states, particularly those in the north of India, and 77% of the population of India were exposed to an annual population-weighted mean PM2·5 greater than the 40 μg/m3 stipulated limits set by the Central Pollution Control Board of India. In addition to providing evidence on the state-level variation of exposure to air pollution, the study reports that if the air pollution exposure levels were lower than the minimum threshold associated with health loss, average life expectancy would increase by 1·7 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1·6–1·9) at the country level, with the smallest increase of 1·0 (0·9–1·1) in Kerala and Goa and the largest increase of 2·5 years (2·0–2·8) in Rajasthan. These estimates give cause for optimism but also urgency for crafting the policies mitigating air pollution by the central and state Governments in India. However, the authors found no single state in India that complied to either WHO-stipulated guidelines (ie, PM2·5 ≤10 μg/m3), or the guideline of India's top pollution regulator, the Central Pollution Control Board (≤40 μg/m3). The state-specific findings of the study help to develop state-specific policies, plans, and interventions to address the challenges of air pollution, particularly in the northern states of India where the exposure and risks of air pollution are much higher.

For example, stubble burning from Punjab and Haryana contributes to nearly 30% of pollution in Delhi. To mitigate air pollution in India, the authors recommended multisectoral engagement across the states and in the country as a whole. However, such engagement tends to be in silos within and outside of the Governments. Health is a state-level matter in India—ie, the primary responsibility of public health decision making lies with the state Governments that are often run by different political parties.

Cosmopolitan moments are short points in time in which the global community join and act together to create new institutions and mechanisms that they have individually not been willing to introduce. At such a point, there is a brief window of opportunity that supports the collective management of global public goods in new ways.

    "ab": "In 2015, the UN adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aiming to \"protect the planet from degradation…so that it can support the needs of the present and future generations\".1UNTransforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. United Nations, New York2015Google Scholar Through the SDGs, the UN recognises that conservation directly supports human health and wellbeing by providing goods like water and fibre, and global public goods like habitat for species and mitigation of climate change.1UNTransforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. United Nations, New York2015Google Scholar, 2Myers SS Gaffikin L Golden CD et al.Human health impacts of ecosystem alteration.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2013; 110: 18753-18760Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar Although trade-offs can indeed arise between conservation and economic development, the Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on planetary health3Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar states unequivocally that \"the environment has been the foundation of human flourishing\", suggesting that if environmental degradation persists then ongoing improvements in human health are likely to be reversed. The increasing availability of data and improved analytical techniques now enable better understanding of where environmental conditions and human health are tightly linked, and where investing in nature can deliver net benefits for people—especially with respect to the most vulnerable populations in developing countries. These advances bring more opportunities for interventions that can advance multiple SDGs at once. We have harmonised a suite of global datasets to explore the essential nexus of forests, poverty, and human health, an overlap of SDG numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, and 15. Our study combined demographic and health surveys for 297 112 children in 35 developing countries with data describing the local environmental conditions for each child (appendix).4Herrera D Ellis A Fisher B et al.Upstream watershed condition predicts rural children's health across 35 developing countries.Nat Commun. 2017; 8: 811Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar This allowed us to estimate the effect forests might have in supporting human health, while controlling for the influence of important socio-economic differences.4Herrera D Ellis A Fisher B et al.Upstream watershed condition predicts rural children's health across 35 developing countries.Nat Commun. 2017; 8: 811Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar We extended this work to look at how forests affect three childhood health concerns of global significance for the world's poorest people: stunting, anaemia, and diarrhoeal disease. We found that, for the poorest households in these 35 countries, forest cover is associated with reduced prevalence of all three childhood maladies, after controlling for potential confounding variables (eg, education, and rainfall; figure). Among children in the two lowest wealth quintiles, those who live in areas with more forest cover were significantly less likely to have these diseases than those living in areas with less forest cover. For children in the two highest wealth quintiles, in contrast, we found no relation between forest cover and any of these health outcomes. We also found that as the amount of upstream forest cover increases, the benefits for the poor increase, particularly for those poor households without access to improved water sources (appendix). These findings suggest that the poorest populations are least capable of replacing natural capital with technology or infrastructure, and are therefore disproportionately affected by the degradation of natural ecosystems. The particular mechanisms through which forest cover can positively affect health outcomes appear to vary among contexts and diseases,5Pattanayak S Wendland K Nature's Care: diarrhea, watershed protection, and biodiversity conservation in Flores, Indonesia.Biodivers Conservation. 2007; 16: 2801-2819Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6Trask JR Kalita PK Kuhlenschmidt MS Smith RD Funk TL Overland and near-surface transport of Cryptosporidium parvum from vegetated and nonvegetated surfaces.J Environ Qual. 2004; 33: 984-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bauch SC Birkenbach AM Pattanayak SK Sills EO Public health impacts of ecosystem change in the Brazilian Amazon.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2015; 112: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and gaining a deeper understanding of these causal mechanisms will be critical in making effective environmental or health interventions.2Myers SS Gaffikin L Golden CD et al.Human health impacts of ecosystem alteration.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2013; 110: 18753-18760Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 3Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar Nonetheless, the positive signal we get from forests in these analyses is notable, given that the combined global effects of diarrhoea, anaemia, and stunting on the world's children are devastating and the world's forests are steadily disappearing. Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of childhood mortality globally, killing more children than malaria, AIDS, and measles combined.8WHOThe Countdown to 2015: maternal, newborn, and child survival. World Health Organization, Geneva2010Google Scholar Iron-deficiency anaemia, the most common form of anaemia, has a role in 20% of maternal deaths.7Bauch SC Birkenbach AM Pattanayak SK Sills EO Public health impacts of ecosystem change in the Brazilian Amazon.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2015; 112: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar Childhood stunting affects over 160 million children worldwide, often limiting physical and cognitive growth for life.8WHOThe Countdown to 2015: maternal, newborn, and child survival. World Health Organization, Geneva2010Google Scholar Investing in ecosystem conservation, restoration, or both, might not only improve childhood health outcomes across much of the developing world where forests are in decline, but also help to weaken the poverty-health trap in which many of the world's poorest people find themselves. The forest–human health connection described here is only one example of the relation among nature, poverty, and human health. Other empirical studies have quantified relations between fisheries decline and nutrient deficiencies,9Golden CD Allison EH Cheung WW et al.Fall in fish catch threatens human health.Nature. 2016; 534: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar between deforestation and malaria,9Golden CD Allison EH Cheung WW et al.Fall in fish catch threatens human health.Nature. 2016; 534: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar and between bushmeat availability and anaemia.10Golden CD Fernald LCH Brashares JS Rasolofoniaina BJR Kremen C Benefits of wildlife consumption to child nutrition in a biodiversity hotspot.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2011; 108: 19653-19656Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar Given the strong associations among well-functioning ecological systems, poverty, and human health, a critical area of research is understanding how natural resource management and conservation can advance multiple SDGs. Clearly understanding these relations is not an easy task. The database we built took over 3 years to build, clean, and operationalise. The complexity of the nature–human health relationship necessitated deep thinking around our theoretical models to control for factors that confound these relations and reflect the differentiated effects of local versus regional environmental processes. Nonetheless, it must become a routine for governments, aid agencies, and other organisations investing in economic development to use the data now available to minimise trade-offs, and to seek co-benefits among environmental health, human health, and equity outcomes.

    "ab": "As humanity enters the Anthropocene epoch, fundamental disruptions to our way of living, including serious effects on human health, have become increasingly likely due to severe global environmental changes. Several planetary boundaries have already been transgressed (eg, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle).1Steffen W Richardson K Rockström J et al.Planetary boundaries: guiding human development on a changing planet.Science. 2015; 347: 1259855Crossref PubMed Scopus (5170) Google Scholar Stabilising Earth in a habitable state requires transformational changes—ie, changing systemic structures causing the problems,2Heikkinen M Ylä-Anttila T Juhola S Incremental, reformistic or transformational: what kind of change do C40 cities advocate to deal with climate change?.J Environ Policy Plan. 2018; 21: 1-14Google Scholar at multiple levels (eg, local, national, and global) and in virtually all sectors of society (eg, decarbonisation of economies, and improved governance).3Steffen W Rockström J Richardson K et al.Trajectories of the Earth system in the Anthropocene.Proc Natl Acad Sci. 2018; 115: 8252-8259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar Borrowing from Martin Luther King Jr's words, there is a “fierce urgency of now. This is no time…to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.”4King ML I have a dream: writings and speeches that changed the world.1st edn. HarperCollins Publishers, New York1963Google Scholar However, the sustainability discourse is often centred around incremental changes to our present way of living. An analysis of policy documents of cities belonging to the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a network promoting the idea of cities as leaders in climate change mitigation and adaptation, showed that most of the proposed measures would only incrementally change the status quo.2Heikkinen M Ylä-Anttila T Juhola S Incremental, reformistic or transformational: what kind of change do C40 cities advocate to deal with climate change?.J Environ Policy Plan. 2018; 21: 1-14Google Scholar Transformational measures were only rarely proposed. Metaphorically, the foundation of our existence is built on quicksand, but we are completely immersed in making our unstable home more cosy by hauling in slightly refurbished furniture. To promote transformational changes and orient these in a common direction, all sectors of society (ie, communities, non-governmental organisations, governments at various levels, and academia) have to find common ground on several fundamental issues: the distributional dimension of environmental degradation and transformational changes, identifying which challenges require high-tech versus low-tech solutions, and an inspiring and mobilising sustainability narrative. First, the degradation of natural systems and its negative effects on human health have important distributional dimensions. Consider climate change: many countries with low to moderate levels of greenhouse gas emissions, including most African countries and small island states, are highly susceptible to the negative effects of climate change. This inequality is expected to increase further by 2030.5Althor G Watson JEM Fuller RA Global mismatch between greenhouse gas emissions and the burden of climate change.Sci Rep. 2016; 6: 20281Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar In addition to cross-country inequalities, pronounced within-country inequalities in carbon emissions exist.6Moser S Kleinhückelkotten S Good intents, but low impacts: diverging importance of motivational and socioeconomic determinants explaining pro-environmental behavior, energy use, and carbon footprint.Environ Behav. 2018; 50: 626-656Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar For society-wide transformational change to happen, a shared commitment to differentiated responsibilities is needed and the far-reaching consequences of this commitment have to be made explicit. Populations and countries contributing the most to the degradation of natural systems have to change their way of living substantially, decrease their resource consumption, and pay for adaptation, whereas countries and individuals contributing the least to natural resource degradation will be allowed to use more natural resources than they are using today. Second, proposed solutions to sustainability challenges, such as climate change, are often dominated by technological fixes. Solutions in the political and social domains involving less technological input are considered less frequently.2Heikkinen M Ylä-Anttila T Juhola S Incremental, reformistic or transformational: what kind of change do C40 cities advocate to deal with climate change?.J Environ Policy Plan. 2018; 21: 1-14Google Scholar A subset of the sustainability challenges will require technological solutions. However, the need for substantial reductions in the use of natural resources will favour low-tech sociopolitical solutions because technological fixes usually require natural resources as input. Separating sustainability challenges amenable to low-tech solutions, such as replacing short distance car rides with walking or biking, from those requiring high-tech solutions, such as the decarbonisation of essential industries, should be the focus of intensive discussion. In short, it is not a pro-technology versus anti-technology question, it is rather a question of finding the right level of technological input for each sustainability challenge while satisfying overall resource constraints and minimising risks. Third, an inspiring sustainability narrative is needed to serve as a guide for practical action in overwhelmingly complex systems.7Jerneck A Searching for a mobilizing narrative on climate change.J Environ Dev. 2014; 23: 15-40Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar This narrative should be characterised by at least three features. It should be mobilising in a way that frames the challenge of sustainability as an issue requiring the involvement of all parts of society. It has to be transformational by conveying that transformational rather than incremental changes will be needed in all sectors of society and from all individuals. And it should be integrative by providing an umbrella for specific narratives of change with meanings at differing organisational levels (eg, local communities). Putting effort into finding common ground on these fundamental issues is essential because broad consensus might reduce resistance to single transformational change initiatives. Returning to the metaphor described earlier: the task of building a house of transformational change on quicksand is substantially less daunting once several stable pillars have been laid as a foundation. And what is the role of planetary health in this endeavour? For planetary health to be transformational as an emerging field, providing solutions for specific sustainability challenges will be necessary but not sufficient. All parts of society, including planetary health as a scientific discipline and movement, have to get involved in finding common ground on these fundamental issues together. Ideally, this involvement would also be reflected by more numerous scientific contributions on these fundamental issues to leading journals and conferences. I declare no competing interests.",

    "ab": "It was an image that stunned the world. In August, 2019, the skies over Sau Paulo gradually turned black. The cause: smoke from the raging Amazon fires. For weeks, the blazes continued. The fires quickly became the worst in more than a decade. Fingers of blame started pointing as one of the world's most important carbon stores went up in flames. For many, Brazil's populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, was most at fault. Why? Because Bolsonaro had run his presidential campaign explicitly in the interests of small ranchers, big agribusinesses, and against Indigenous Amazonian communities. The fires were seen as a result of his dichotomous agenda, which pitched economic development against the preservation of the forest and the protection of the peoples that inhabit it. The National Institute for Space Research (INPE) recorded more than 74 000 Amazon fires between January and August, 2019. An area larger than Ireland was affected. There were worse fires in the mid-2000s, but not since 2009 had the Amazon experienced destruction on this scale. This season's fires were the largest since measurements began in 2012, and an 80% increase in 2019 compared with 2018, INPE's data shows. The fires released the equivalent of 228 megatonnes of carbon dioxide, driving climate change. They also released carbon monoxide and dangerous particulate matter, both of which have significant implications for human health. The fires were a major global problem because the Amazon's trees are extremely old and absorb a lot of carbon dioxide, helping to limit climate change. The Amazon rainforest is also home to a mind-boggling number of species making it a global hotspot for biodiversity which is undergoing rapid decline. Species with low mobility, such as insects and vertebrates including turtles, lizards, and amphibians were unlikely to escape the fires. More mobile species like Jaguars, capybara, freshwater dolphins, sloths, armadillos, tapirs, and more than 1000 species of birds also rely on the forest for food and shelter. No wonder Cristiana Paşca Palmer, the executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, called the fires “extraordinarily concerning” for natural systems. Nonetheless, on Sept 24, 2019, President Bolsonaro told the UN General Assembly that it was a “fallacy” to suggest that “the Amazon is the heritage of humankind”. The disaster had “aroused” Brazil's “patriotic sentiment”, Bolsonaro said, accusing those that tried to claim the fires were anything other than a domestic problem were questioning “what is most sacred to us: our sovereignty!” For Christian Poirier, a campaigner with US-based Amazon Watch, Bolsonaro's speech deliberately misrepresented the international response, however. “Brazil is a sovereign country. Of course it is. No one's questioning that. But the fact that Brazil is not doing its duty to protect one of the most important biomes for the climate is definitely cause for legitimate global concern and action”, he said. Why was Bolsonaro's response so robust? In a word: development. Professor Anthony Pereira, Director of the Brazil Institute at King's College London, explains how the president has a very simple logic when it comes to Amazonian conservation: “Bolsonaro himself seems to have a strongly dichotomous view that you either develop the Amazon and destroy a lot of the forest or you preserve.” With such an approach, the president and his Partido Social Liberal party are hoping to appeal to a specific subset of voters, Pereira explains: “One of the constituencies that Bolsonaro and his administration is appealing to are fairly small scale loggers, miners and ranchers in the Amazon itself.” “There's also some appeal to bigger companies, including multinationals, who know that there's a lot of mineral wealth in the Amazon region, and they want to open things up to them. Some of it is big agriculture businesses.” “Brazilian politics is very much about creating a confederation across the 26 states and the federal district. And most of the governors in the Amazon, in what is called the legal Amazon, are in parties allied to Bolsonaro in Congress. And most of them like the deforestation message because it is a vote winner for them in their local areas.” Dr Andreza A De Souza Santo, Lecturer and Director of the Brazilian Studies Programme at the Latin American Centre, University of Oxford, agrees that Bolsonaro's approach is deliberately simplistic, but argues that it could also be effective in the short-term. “Of course, things have changed and it is possible to have a very different model of development—but the way Bolsonaro's approach delivers is different in terms of timing, profits, and distribution. So it's a choice, because this model of development that is extractivist and aggressive delivers really quickly, but it benefits very few people and it leaves a big environmental impact.” The Amazon fires weren't just a consequence of Bolsonaro's old fashioned development rhetoric, however. For many, Bolsonaro is using deforestation as a means to implement a much more sinister agenda, attacking the rights of Indigenous peoples. Bolsonaro has previously said that protecting indigenous lands was a “nonsense”. In his speech to the UN in September, 2019, he claimed NGOs seeking to protect indigenous lands were “treating and keeping our natives as cavemen”. As well as opening the region up for development, deforesting the Amazon destroys swathes of Indigenous land. That those agendas go hand in hand is not a coincidence, Pereira says. “You can't really get away from the Indigenous question when you think about deforestation of the Amazon because so much of the rainforest has been set aside in Indigenous reserves and environmental reserves.” “Bolsonaro thinks that the reserves are way too big; bigger than they need. He seems to think that Indigenous people want to assimilate and that they don't want to live the way they've been living. And that you have to diminish the size of these reserves and turn parts of them over to developments like mining and ranching”, he said. The attacks on Indigenous lands are particularly problematic as the communities are very effective conservationists. An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report, released in August, 2019, acknowledged the vital role Indigenous communities play in understanding how to tackle climate change's impact on soils, forests, and food security. Alain Frechette, a director of Rights and Resources, a coalition of over 200 groups representing Indigenous communities, said in a statement that the report was “a critical reminder from the world's top scientists that there is already an effective solution to this crisis in place: recognizing the rights of the indigenous peoples and local communities who have cared for the world's forests for generations.” Despite this, no one should be surprised by Bolsonaro unapologetic reaction to the Amazon fires, given the tone of his campaign, according to Amazon Watch's Poirier. “Indigenous peoples in their territories are a clear impediment to the aggressive expansion of Brazilian agribusiness today. They represent lands off the market,” he said. “During his election campaign he ran on a platform that was entirely anti-human rights and anti-environmental. So he's basically doing what he said he would do.” Despite the international community's condemnation, Bolsonaro and his government didn't actually start the fires. Many of the fires were sparked not by large agribusinesses, but small freeholders. However, it's unfair to blame those individuals for a global failure to properly protect such an important carbon stock and hub of biodiversity, argues Associate Professor Jeffrey Hoelle, a cultural anthropologist based at the University of California, Santa Barbra. “There are illegal activities, there are big guys, but there are also these smallholders who—when you add it all up—add a lot of burning and deforestation. But they're usually doing it to provide for their family. They don't have any sort of technological alternative to these very basic rudimentary technologies of burning and cutting,” he points out. “There's a lot of really admirable pioneers who left poverty or tenement farming situations in the south or left the slums in an attempt to get their own piece of land. And they start with a small little clearing and they are not living the life of luxury by any means. We would consider them heroes in a previous century, and they still see themselves in that way.” So how can this be stopped? By properly pricing the value of the Amazon, Hoelle says: “There are ways to keep this in check. A lot of it boils down to money. Either not having a market for a product because it's classified as illegally deforested, or we need the stick but also the carrot—let's try to finally figure out a way to create value for these forests.” That way, Bolsonaro's anti-Indigenous community rhetoric and pro-development pro-destruction policy agenda will be blunted, as his core constituency will no longer be open to appeals to destroy the Amazon in the name of development. This is not a new idea, but it has so far proved very difficult to implement—not least when governments such as Bolsonaro's have an ideological objection to forest conservation. Some argue that the Amazon fires show current international efforts falling under the umbrella of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation policies (known as REDD) have failed. Others argue the fires show the market-led efforts are more vital than ever. Ultimately, perhaps the only way to address the issue is to try and change the perspective of those tasked with preserving the world's increasingly valuable carbon stores. “You have to question, is this really a good strategy?” De Souza Santos says. “Politically, internationally—for the image of Brazil—and economically, it is all very costly,” she argues. But until Bolsonaro and others accept that, the Amazon will remain a treasure with scarce protection.

The complex relationship between A darlingi and deforestation has led the intense debate regarding the factors underlying malaria emergence in the Amazon. Most theories about this relationship seem plausible, but because it is non-linear these theories have been based on evidence that only partially shows what is happening. Here we propose that deforestation can increase or decrease malaria incidence depending of the amount of forest cover. Amazonian biodiversity is under threat because of the widespread depletion of the habitats for native species,10Alroy J Effects of habitat disturbance on tropical forest biodiversity.PNAS. 2017; 114: 6056-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar including the larval habitats of A darlingi. Therefore, a win-lose scenario for planetary health is presented. We could be facing a much-wanted era of malaria elimination in Brazil, but and at the same time ruining the last remnants of tropical rainforests in the Amazon. I declare no competing interests.",

    "ab": "In the past decade, studies and statements from international agencies on the relationship between ambient air pollution and human health have raised the call for action. An analysis1Cohen AJ Brauer M Burnett R et al.Estimates and 25-year trends of the global burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution: an analysis of data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1907-1918Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar of the data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015 indicated that approximately 4·2 million deaths and 103 million disability-adjusted life-years were attributable to exposure to particulates, with similar data available from WHO.2WHOAmbient air pollution: a global assessment of exposure and burden of disease.https://www.who.int/phe/publications/air-pollution-global-assessment/en/Date: 2016Date accessed: March 26, 2019Google Scholar The Lancet Commission on Air Pollution and Health3Landrigan PJ Fuller R Acosta NJR et al.The Lancet Commission on pollution and health.Lancet. 2018; 391: 462-512Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar stated that 16% of all premature deaths in 2015 were attributable to pollution. Among these alarming statistics, adverse respiratory health assumes a priority position, particularly among children. Childhood asthma has reached global epidemic proportions4Asher I Pearce N Global burden of asthma among children.Int J Tuberc Lung Dis. 2014; 18: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar and, although the evidence for a causal relationship with ambient pollution is still emerging, studies have repeatedly shown associations of pollution with various asthma phenotypes and proxy markers, such as emergency room visits, school absenteeism, and steroid dependency. However, a level of inconsistency exists across various pollutants for these outcomes. For example, a 2017 meta-analysis5Khreis H Kelly C Tate J Parslow R Lucas K Nieuwenhuijsen M Exposure to traffic related air pollution and risk of development of childhood asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Environ Int. 2017; 100: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar reported the varying risk for asthma incidence across studies, with odds ratios ranges of 0·93–1·25 for each 4 μg/m3 increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and 0·84–1·32 for each 1 μg/m3 increase in fine particulate matter (PM2·5) concentrations. Despite these inconsistencies, meta-analyses5Khreis H Kelly C Tate J Parslow R Lucas K Nieuwenhuijsen M Exposure to traffic related air pollution and risk of development of childhood asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Environ Int. 2017; 100: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 6Bowatte G Lodge C Lowe AJ et al.The influence of childhood traffic-related air pollution exposure on asthma, allergy and sensitization: a systematic review and a meta-analysis of birth cohort studies.Allergy. 2014; 70: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar of traffic-related air pollution and childhood asthma incidence provide convincing evidence for increased risk of exposure, particularly for NO2. These effects are seen at concentrations below the ambient air quality guidelines recommended by WHO7WHOWHO air quality guidelines for particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide: global update 2005—summary of risk assessment.http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/69477Date: 2006Date accessed: March 30, 2019Google Scholar of 40 μg/m3 (21 ppb) annual average NO2 concentrations. A better understanding of the pollutant-related effects on childhood asthma incidence at a global level is crucial to addressing interventions and policy initiatives. In The Lancet Planetary Health, Pattanun Achakulwisut and colleagues8Achakulwisut P Brauer M Hystad P Anenberg SC Global, national, and urban burdens of paediatric asthma incidence attributable to ambient NO2 pollution: estimates from global datasets.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; (published online April 10.)http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(19)30046-4Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar provide a novel approach to this challenge. By use of well validated global datasets for both exposure and outcome and with estimates of risk derived from the scientific literature, the authors modelled childhood asthma incidence attributable to NO2. Concentration-response functions were derived from a meta-analysis that reported a relative risk of 1·26 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 1·10–1·37) for every 10 ppb increase in NO2 concentrations. Global NO2 surface concentrations were derived from a land use regression model that extracted data from over 5000 ground-level monitors in 58 countries, as well as satellite-available pollution data.9Larkin A Geddes JA Martin R V et al.Global land use regression model for nitrogen dioxide air pollution.Environ Sci Technol. 2017; 51: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar The 2015 Global Human Settlement population grid provided population distribution and density information, and country-specific and age-group-specific asthma incidence rates were obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation for 194 countries. The major advance of Achakulwisut and colleagues' study, compared with previous works, was the ability to estimate this incidence at very fine spatial resolution of 250 × 250 m across 21 regions, 194 countries, and 125 major cities globally. The advantage of this resolution allowed for determining within-city variation, differentiating between urban risk zones. On the basis of their analysis, the authors reported that 4·0 million (95% UI 1·8–5·2) new childhood asthma cases could be attributable to NO2 pollution annually, accounting for 13% (6–16) of the incidence worldwide. Attributable burden varied across regions, ranging from 340 cases per year per 100 000 children (95% UI 150–440) in Andean Latin America to 76 cases (33–100) in eastern sub-Saharan Africa. Large-city variation was also evident, ranging from 690 cases per year per 100 000 children (330–870) in Lima, Peru, to 83 cases (36–110) in Orlu, Nigeria, with Chinese cities mostly in the 400–650 range. A substantial percentage of childhood asthma incidence was attributed to NO2 exposure, globally, but this was most striking for the Chinese cities: Shanghai (48%, 95% UI 25–57), Tianjin (43%, 16–42); Beijing (42%, 21–51) and Shenyang (41%, 21–50). Despite providing a novel approach to understanding the relationship between traffic-related air pollution and childhood asthma, Achakulwisut and colleagues' study brings forth important epidemiological challenges. The lower estimates of risk seen in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, compared with those in other regions, are largely driven by data availability. Exposure data is sparse for these regions, influencing the development of exposure models from these countries.9Larkin A Geddes JA Martin R V et al.Global land use regression model for nitrogen dioxide air pollution.Environ Sci Technol. 2017; 51: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar Additionally, asthma incidence data are likely to be very scarce, particularly with the use of so-called doctor-diagnosed asthma outcome definition in countries with poor health-care access, resulting in caregivers and children not being aware that their, or their children's, symptoms might be typical of asthma. These issues are likely to bias the findings from these regions. A better understanding of the risk in such regions is necessary, because research findings might have policy implications for interventions in these low-middle-income countries. An important outcome from this study is the further evidence that the existing WHO standards are not protective against childhood asthma. Achakulwisut and colleagues estimated that approximately 92% of the childhood asthma incidence attributable to NO2 exposure was in areas with NO2 concentrations below the values of the WHO annual average guidelines. This strengthens the case for the downward revision of these global standards and for stronger national policy initiatives in countries without air quality standards. Furthermore, these findings not only support the association of NO2 exposure with childhood asthma incidence, but also, because this pollutant serves as an important proxy for broader traffic related air pollutants, highlight that urgent intervention is necessary to protect the health of those most vulnerable in society: children, particularly those with pre-existing respiratory disease. I declare no competing interests. Global, national, and urban burdens of paediatric asthma incidence attributable to ambient NO2 pollution: estimates from global datasetsEfforts to reduce NO2 exposure could help prevent a substantial portion of new paediatric asthma cases in both developed and developing countries, and especially in urban areas. Traffic emissions should be a target for exposure-mitigation strategies. The adequacy of the WHO guideline for ambient NO2 concentrations might need to be revisited. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "BackgroundWe constructed measures of an individual's gendered behaviour and their gendered environment to investigate the salience of gender norms during adolescence for social mobility during the next decade of life.MethodsIn this nationally representative observational study, we collected individual-level data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which enrolled a cohort of nationally representative school students aged 11–19 years from across the USA and followed them up for 14 years (ie, to age 25–33 years). We characterised gendered behaviour for adolescents in a performative sense via self-reports of behaviours and beliefs. We aggregated this individual-level measure to create a proxy measure of an individual's social context by taking averages for an individual's peers of the same sex and school year.FindingsBetween Jan 5, 1994, and Dec 26, 1995, Add Health collected data on a cohort of 20 745 students. 14 540 respondents were followed-up 14 years later between April 3, 2007, and Feb 1, 2009, of whom 7722 (53·1%) were female. More masculine male respondents were downwardly mobile; they were enrolled in school for fewer years and were more likely to have lower status jobs than their less masculine same-sex school peers. More masculine male respondents were also more likely to have jobs in occupational categories with larger proportions of males than their same-sex school peers. Gendered behaviour was not predictive of future educational and occupational attainment for female respondents. Male adolescents in school years with more masculine same-sex peers than male adolescents in other school years also tended to have lower educational and occupational attainment than their male peers. Educational and occupational attainment in early midlife for female respondents was not affected by their gendered environment.InterpretationGender, when measured as a set of gender-distinct behaviours in adolescence, was associated with differential patterns of social mobility from adolescence to young adulthood. Moreover, variation in an individual's local gender norms has implications for subsequent socioeconomic attainment, especially for male adolescents. These findings have potential implications for observed health disparities.FundingBill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

    "ab": "BackgroundDeclining proportions of male births have been reported in several industrialised countries. Previous reports have shown that exposure to certain chemical substances might influence the secondary sex ratio (SSR). We assessed the associations between paternal occupational exposure to chemicals and the SSR of their children using the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS), a large-scale birth cohort study.MethodsData on paternal occupational exposure to various agents and other covariates were collected using a self-administered questionnaire to partners of pregnant female participants enrolled in the JECS. After adjusting for potential confounders, multivariable modified Poisson regression models were used to evaluate associations between paternal occupational exposures and the SSR of their children. This study was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number UMIN000030786.FindingsThe JECS study gathered data on 103 062 pregnancies, 104 065 fetuses, and 51 898 partners of pregnant women. Among 50 283 children with data on paternal occupational exposures, 25 657 were male and 24 626 were female. The proportion of boys whose fathers were regularly occupationally exposed to insecticides was 0·445 (males, n=293; females, n=366; 95% CI 0·406–0·483), which was lower than the proportion of boys whose fathers were not exposed to insecticides. After adjusting for confounding factors, regular paternal occupational exposure to insecticides (adjusted relative risk 0·86, 95% CI 0·78–0·96) and medical disinfectants (0·95, 0·90–1·00) were significantly associated with lower SSRs among their offspring compared with the offspring of fathers not exposed to these substances.InterpretationA declining proportion of boys could potentially be due to fathers working in environments in which they are exposed to chemicals. The associations between poorer semen quality and levels of reproductive and thyroid hormones require investigation.FundingMinistry of the Environment of Japan.",

    "ab": "Decision-making on antimicrobial use relies on an interdependent mix of economic, behavioural, ethical, and cultural factors. In animal agriculture, antimicrobials are used to achieve: economic objectives, via optimisation of farm benefits related to sale of animal derived foodstuffs; animal welfare objectives, by ensuring good health at individual and herd levels; and public health objectives, via limiting risk of zoonotic diseases. There is evidence showing the effect of antimicrobial use in animal agriculture on antimicrobial resistance in humans.1Tang KL Caffrey NP Nóbrega DB et al.Restricting the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals and its associations with antibiotic resistance in food-producing animals and human beings: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: 316-327Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar The growing magnitude of this public health issue is encouraging the development and implementation of policies such as voluntary agreements, taxes, or permits, to decrease antimicrobial use in food-producing animals.2Van Boeckel TP Glennon EE Chen D et al.Reducing antimicrobial use in food animals.Science. 2017; 357: 1350-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar The growing scientific literature spanning from microbiology, agricultural and environmental sciences, medicine and public health, pharmaceutical development, and ethics and law, to behaviour and economics, provides evidence for the public commitment dedicated to tackle antimicrobial resistance. Additionally, other research stresses the importance of understanding anthropological and socioeconomic factors contributing to antimicrobial resistance,3Collignon P Beggs JJ Walsh TR Gandra S Laxminarayan R Anthropological and socioeconomic factors contributing to global antimicrobial resistance: a univariate and multivariable analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e398-e405Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar and pinpoints that there are gaps in the global governance of this issue.4Wernli D Jørgensen PS Harbarth S et al.Antimicrobial resistance: The complex challenge of measurement to inform policy and the public.PLoS Med. 2017; 14: 1-9Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar An appropriate and functional scientific framework can help to integrate different strategies to curb antimicrobial resistance. As with many unsustainable production and consumption practices, the responses to address the challenge caused by the rise of antimicrobial resistance have been formulated after the event, and scarcely consider the complexity of social-ecological systems (SES), overlooking unexpected consequences of potential policies.5Merrett GLB Bloom G Wilkinson A MacGregor H Towards the just and sustainable use of antibiotics.J Pharm Policy Pract. 2016; 9: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar We advocate that evaluating antimicrobial use in animal agriculture as a sustainability issue under an SES perspective, in which human and nature are deeply entangled,6McGinnis MD Ostrom E Social-ecological system framework: initial changes and continuing challenges.Ecol Soc. 2014; 19: 30Crossref Scopus (741) Google Scholar can help to decompartmentalise national and international traditionally sector-based decision making, which affects stakeholders with opposing interests. We propose to determine optimal antimicrobial use in animal agriculture using a SES framework and multi-criteria decision analysis, beyond the classic cost–benefit or risk analysis perspectives. This scheme requires determining which indicators at the frontier of biological and social domains would be able to capture the social, environmental, and economic implications of a specific SES scaled to time and space. The Public Health-Economic-Environmental-Social-Political model shows a set of public health, economic, environmental, social, and policy response indicators (appendix). Public health indicators commonly used in health economics, such as value of a statistical life or quality-adjusted life year, allow all for the presentation of different outcomes of the sustainability assessment in the common metric of monetary units. A challenge is to determine the extent of these metrics as a function of antimicrobial use in agriculture. Economic indicators consist of a set of indicators capturing the viability of the farming system.7Food and Agriculture OrganizationSustainability assessment of food and agriculture systems. Guidelines version 3.0.http://www.fao.org/nr/sustainability/sustainability-assessments-safa/en/Date: 2013Date accessed: February 14, 2019Google Scholar One ideal environmental indicator consists of measuring the evolution of bacterial susceptibility over space, time, and among animal and human communities and in the environment. Given the technical feasibility and availability of such data, a set of indicators of susceptibility to be included in our model should be identified per animal production category. However, the complexity of collecting harmonised data for bacterial susceptibility trends among countries requires the addition of complementary indicators, such as antimicrobial consumption, as the most simple and easy way to monitor and compare across the food systems of countries. Social indicators are related to the wellbeing of farm communities, consumers, and animals. They integrate the dimensions of food safety, food security, and animal welfare. Policy response indicators measure qualitatively and quantitatively the implementation of national policies. They encompass the feasibility of the response, depending on the time horizon of the policy planning and on available resources. These indicators also consider the progression of the policies from the framing to implementation, and the deadlines specified (if any) to observe an improvement in the SES, because of the expected delays between enactment and the effects on the other indicators.8Hoffman SJ Outterson K What will it take to address the global threat of antibiotic resistance?.J Law Med Ethics. 2015; 43: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar To achieve a sustainability assessment on antimicrobial use, combining methods developed for environmental systems analysis with tools used in public health and economics is of particular relevance. A simultaneous assessment of the associations and indicators presented here should be completed by the use of a system dynamics modelling approach. A multi-criteria objective function with trade-offs between animal and human welfare would produce a single index social welfare function to be assessed by simulation, or optimised with specified controls, such as antimicrobial use by an animal group over time. Functional relations would be estimated with data collected or generated by various techniques, including expert judgements and experiments, as well as primary and secondary data collection.

    "ab": "A key challenge in the Anthropocene is to adequately understand future risks to the health of human and natural systems and to design solutions that successfully avoid, prepare for, or manage the identified risks.1Sterner T Barbier EB Bateman I et al.Policy design for the Anthropocene.Nat Sustain. 2019; 2: 14-21Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 2O'Neill DW Fanning AL Lamb WF Steinberger JK A good life for all within planetary boundaries.Nat Sustain. 2018; 1: 88-95Crossref Scopus (639) Google Scholar This process of learning needs to be swift and rooted in the best-available evidence—ie, in formal evidence synthesis. Both the health and the global environmental change communities have developed into flagships of scientific policy advice with distinct approaches. Global environmental assessments—particularly those done by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—synthesise the knowledge required to advance international negotiations. These syntheses were crucial. Without the robust evidence provided by the IPCC and the institutionalised dialogue between scientists and climate diplomats, neither the Kyoto Protocol nor the Paris Agreement would have been possible. Similarly, evidence synthesis in the health sciences have dramatically improved our understanding of the exposures that harm health and the efficacy of various interventions to improve patient treatment and accelerate progress through enhanced efficiency and information flow. Method development and standardisation of systematic reviews of evidence routinely inform health-care policies. The success of this approach is catalysing uptake in other disciplines, such as the social and environmental sciences.3Minx JC Callaghan M Lamb WF Garard J Edenhofer O Learning about climate change solutions in the IPCC and beyond.Environ Sci Policy. 2017; 77: 252-259Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar Evidence synthesis in health science is primarily an ex-post, bottom-up exploration of risks and interventions. The basic framework is that population health problems can be compartmentalised into specific questions regarding, for example, the effects associated with a particular exposure and the effective everyday treatment of patients, with each concept organised as an individual evidence pyramid (from primary studies to guidelines and decision support tools; figure). Learning emerges almost exclusively from a rigorous understanding of what works on the basis of an experimental exploration of the effectiveness of interventions.4Institute of Medicine Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Comparative Effectiveness ResearchFinding what works in health care: standards for systematic reviews. The National Academies Press, Washington DC, USA2011Google Scholar Systematic reviews are the central building blocks of evidence synthesis. Learning is mainly facilitated by aggregating results from similar experiments across the literature and understanding the drivers of variations. Such evidence syntheses follow rigorous standards established by organisations such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer, Cochrane, the Campbell Collaboration, or the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence to inform decision making with the best available evidence rooted in the principles of transparency, repeatability, objectiveness, and comprehensiveness.5Higgins J Thomas J Chandler J et al.Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions version 6.0 (updated July 2019). Cochrane, 2019www.training.cochrane.org/handbookDate accessed: July 11, 2019Crossref Scopus (26960) Google Scholar Policy demands can be met by moving up an evidence pyramid from primary studies to systematic reviews—ultimately to clinical guidelines and decision support tools.6Alper BS Haynes RB EBHC pyramid 5.0 for accessing preappraised evidence and guidance.Evid Based Med. 2016; 21: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar Therefore, no overview assessment across health domains exist as they do in the global environmental change community. Evidence synthesis traditions in the global environmental change community emerged to answer broad, multidisciplinary, and mainly forward-looking policy questions through comprehensive assessment reports that synthesise multiple lines and types of evidence. Such grand scientific assessments of future risks are required because climate change is a wicked policy problem that could severely, pervasively, and irreversibly affect human and natural systems in the absence of an adequate human response. In such a world of foresight, there is a broad perception that relevant evidence includes mechanistic understanding, theory, data, models, and expert judgment, because there is no observed data for projected future events.7Mastrandrea MD Mach KJ Plattner GK et al.The IPCC AR5 guidance note on consistent treatment of uncertainties: A common approach across the working groups.Clim Change. 2011; 108: 675Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Ebi KL Differentiating theory from evidence in determining confidence in an assessment finding.Clim Change. 2011; 108: 693Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar Model ensembles exploring alternative futures function as important synthetic hubs, where knowledge from different disciplinary domains are combined. The evidence synthesis pyramid is organised from the top down, where the middle layer focusing on evidence synthesis is expected to emerge, driven by knowledge demands from IPCC and other global environmental assessments. This demand is currently met primarily by the modelling community that has institutionalised scenario development and synthesis platforms such as Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, the Integrated Assessment Modelling Consortium, or the International Committee On New Integrated Climate change assessment Scenarios.9Eyring V Bony S Meehl GA et al.Overview of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) experimental design and organization.Geosci Model Dev. 2016; 9: 1937-1958Crossref Scopus (3418) Google Scholar Despite their strengths, both the health and global environmental change approaches have weaknesses that limit enhanced learning. The narrow, disciplinary-focused approach in health might be appropriate to understand the effectiveness of different interventions, but does not lend itself to understanding the grand challenge of securing human and planetary health. Some of the biggest public health risks are projected to be ahead of us, but scenario approaches that evaluate alternative futures remain largely foreign to the health community. The framework for systematic reviews—the only commonly accepted tool for evidence synthesis in the field—cannot be directly applied when synthesising studies of the future risks of climate change. For example, setting a priori criteria for evaluating the quality and results of models does not lend itself to assessing global environmental change with its deep uncertainty on how certain outcomes unfold in a particular time and space. Moreover, wicked policy problems around the health of natural and human systems often raise much broader questions that do not follow an intervention-focused systematic review logic. Instead, integrating multiple lines of evidence from different disciplines is crucial to developing actionable policy-relevant information, but the field of health has been slow in developing adequate methods for its toolkit. The global environmental change community successfully established model intercomparisons as a rigorous, synthetic tool that has been instrumental for understanding global environmental change.9Eyring V Bony S Meehl GA et al.Overview of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) experimental design and organization.Geosci Model Dev. 2016; 9: 1937-1958Crossref Scopus (3418) Google Scholar However, little progress has been made outside the modelling community in understanding climate solutions because of a noticeable absence of systematic review methods and their communities of practice. In most of the agricultural, social, and engineering sciences of global environmental change, reviews are generally personal, non-transparent synopses of selections of the scientific literature. As a result, there is little learning on what policy interventions and governance structures work under what conditions and why. Similarly, the absence of common practices to critically appraise study validity leaves untouched any potential to increase the quality of future primary research by identifying best practices and deficiencies in study design.3Minx JC Callaghan M Lamb WF Garard J Edenhofer O Learning about climate change solutions in the IPCC and beyond.Environ Sci Policy. 2017; 77: 252-259Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar Because evidence synthesis traditions in the health and global environmental change communities are highly complementary, bringing them together would facilitate shared learning and enhanced evidence synthesis practices. This merge would require a fundamental cultural shift in two matured and siloed scientific communities that would ultimately require changes to research practices, university curricula, academic incentive systems, and funding schemes. A pragmatic start could focus on establishing a dialogue and scientific exchange between these communities. We suggest four entry points. First, raising awareness and education: knowledge sharing and education of researchers and decision makers regarding evidence synthesis methods and traditions could increase capacity for and understanding of both systems, and facilitate integration and cross-fertilisation. Second, collect synthetic evidence: low-hanging fruit for strengthening the evidence of global environmental assessments and connecting them with medical research communities is packaging systematic review evidence and channelling it into IPCC and similar assessment processes during the review of drafts or by providing it to chapter leads or authors. Similarly, public health assessments can be strengthened by considering how global environmental and other changes could affect the magnitude and pattern of future health burdens.10Ebi KL Health in the new scenarios for climate change research.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2013; 11: 30-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar Third, engage the communities: a broader involvement of systematic review scholars with appropriate expertise to be coauthors on global environmental assessments (we recognise that evidence synthesists are already engaged in health-related chapters to some degree). On the other hand, working groups on key global environmental change topics such as climate change or biodiversity could be founded within Cochrane, the Campbell Collaboration, and the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence. Fourth, institutionalise communication and collaboration: it will be important to establish sustained communication between lead institutions in evidence synthesis communities such as the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, Cochrane, the Campbell Collaboration, or the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence. Collaborations could be institutionalised by founding working groups on climate and global environmental change in these institutions, and by electing health and systematic review scholars into governing bodies of global environmental assessments. These starting points are modest given the challenges, but developing collaborations across these communities is an effective approach to raising awareness of the societal need for them to join forces. Comprehensive solution-oriented assessments of the grand challenges of our time require merging both evidence synthesis traditions—ie, rigorous systematic review of policy interventions that tell us what works under which conditions and why, and model-based explorations of the future through IPCC and the large model-intercomparison exercises. Merging both evidence synthesis approaches will provide more comprehensive and rigorous synthetic evidence. A new, enhanced evidence synthesis system that entails both traditions can create formal interfaces between ex-ante and ex-post, qualitative and quantitative, as well as modelling and empirical evidence. Such a system will provide increased efficiency, better evidence-informed policy on issues that matter, reduce research waste, and higher quality research and assessment. It could enable, for the first time, an evidence synthesis pyramid that really works. The planetary health community is in a sweet spot between the health and global environmental change community. As such, it could become a major catalyst of change towards enhanced evidence synthesis that will unleash desperately needed progress in both communities and lift actionable scientific policy advice to the next level.

In the past, it has been suggested that natural and man-made disasters could worsen air pollution in both the short and long term. In the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, intense dust exposure led to a long-term increase in asthma attacks.4Brackbill RM Hadler JL DiGrande L et al.Asthma and posttraumatic stress symptoms 5 to 6 years following exposure to the World Trade Center terrorist attack.JAMA. 2009; 302: 502-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar After the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, dust and sludge contributed to short-term impairment of respiratory health.5Yamanda S Hanagama M Kobayashi S et al.The impact of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake on hospitalisation for respiratory disease in a rapidly aging society: a retrospective descriptive and cross-sectional study at the disaster base hospital in Ishinomaki.BMJ open. 2013; 3: e000865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar The notable difference with such disasters in developed countries is that in Nepal scraps and collapsed buildings still remain around residential areas due to delayed clean-up and restoration work under the logistics and insufficient resources of the Nepali Government. Given these conditions, there is a great potential for severe health effects, although little has been studied regarding possible associations between the earthquakes and the health implications due to worsened air quality. The health burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Nepal is a particularly important area of research regarding both the earthquake and increasing air pollution. An article published in 2015 suggested that NCDs constitute 44% of the deaths and 80% of the outpatient burden in Nepal.7Mishra SR Neupane D Bhandari PM Khanal V Kallestrup P Burgeoning burden of non-communicable diseases in Nepal: a scoping review.Global Health. 2015; 11: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar The burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases was particularly large, representing 43% of hospital visits, followed by cardiovascular diseases (40%), and diabetes (12%).7Mishra SR Neupane D Bhandari PM Khanal V Kallestrup P Burgeoning burden of non-communicable diseases in Nepal: a scoping review.Global Health. 2015; 11: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar Because air pollution can increase the risk of diabetes and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,2Ministry of Population and EnvironmentAir quality management action plan for Kathmandu Valley.http://doenv.gov.np/files/download/Report%20on%20AQM%20Action%20Plan%202017.pdfDate: June, 2017Date accessed: April 29, 2018Google Scholar, 6Yang BY Qian ZM Li S et al.Ambient air pollution in relation to diabetes and glucose-homoeostasis markers in China: a cross-sectional study with findings from the 33 Communities Chinese Health Study.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e64-e73Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar the health burden of NCDs could have been accelerated by the earthquake. A unique point of the recovery work in Nepal is that, despite challenges for population health after the earthquake, some positive signs have been observed, and could pave the way for improvements in air quality.8Parajuly K Pollution: clean up the air in Kathmandu.Nature. 2016; 533: 321Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar For example, a large number of brick kilns in Kathmandu Valley were damaged after the earthquake; it is estimated that approximately 95% of them required repairs.9weADAPTBrick kilns in Nepal: building back better after the 2015 Earthquake.https://www.weadapt.org/knowledge-base/sdc-climate-change-environment-network/building-back-better-after-the-2015-earthquakeDate: June, 2017Date accessed: April 29, 2018Google Scholar Because kilns are a major source of sulphur dioxide, multiple organisations have used this opportunity to upgrade the standard of the brick kilns that were damaged. These improvements have led to a reduction in pollutant emissions—mainly sulphur dioxide but also carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.9weADAPTBrick kilns in Nepal: building back better after the 2015 Earthquake.https://www.weadapt.org/knowledge-base/sdc-climate-change-environment-network/building-back-better-after-the-2015-earthquakeDate: June, 2017Date accessed: April 29, 2018Google Scholar This example shows one of the many avenues that the post-earthquake phase has opened for building back better: a government initiative that focuses on making safer and earthquake resilient structures by helping people build houses that adhere to the country's house building codes.9weADAPTBrick kilns in Nepal: building back better after the 2015 Earthquake.https://www.weadapt.org/knowledge-base/sdc-climate-change-environment-network/building-back-better-after-the-2015-earthquakeDate: June, 2017Date accessed: April 29, 2018Google Scholar The government of Nepal set a target to reduce premature deaths caused by NCDs by a third by 2030 as a part of chieving the Sustainable Development Goals.10Kurmi O Regmi PR Pant PR Implication of air pollution on health effects in Nepal: lessons from global research.Nepal J Epidemiol. 2016; 6: 525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar It is imperative for the government to take meaningful steps to combat the ongoing problem of air pollution through comprehensive assessment and timely responses, with the 2015 constitution of Nepal guaranteeing people's right to live in a clean and healthy environment.10Kurmi O Regmi PR Pant PR Implication of air pollution on health effects in Nepal: lessons from global research.Nepal J Epidemiol. 2016; 6: 525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Now is the time to not only prioritise air pollution as a public health issue, but also to act effectively and use this opportunity to build back better following the earthquake.

A recent systematic review including 565 studies primarily reporting patient-level data found that antibiotic exposure, underlying disease, and invasive procedures had the greatest evidence of being antibiotic resistance drivers.2Chatterjee A Modarai M Naylor NR et al.Quantifying drivers of antibiotic resistance in humans: a systematic review.Lancet Infect Dis. 2018; 18: e368-e378Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar Given the small evidence base for the role of community factors,2Chatterjee A Modarai M Naylor NR et al.Quantifying drivers of antibiotic resistance in humans: a systematic review.Lancet Infect Dis. 2018; 18: e368-e378Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar we fully concur with Collignon and colleagues about the importance of considering such factors in the spread of antibiotic resistance.1Collignon P Beggs JJ Walsh TR Gandra S Laxminarayan R Anthropological and socioeconomic factors contributing to global antimicrobial resistance: a univariate and multivariable analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e398-e405Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar However, as the authors recognise, correlation does not imply causation—indeed, national meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus rates strongly correlate with unfair play of national football teams.3Meyer E Gastmeier P Schwab F National MRSA rates run along with fair play of national football teams: a cross-sectional data analysis of the European Football Championship, 2008.Infection. 2013; 41: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar Conversely, it would be a mistake to conclude that weak (or even inverse) correlation between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance at the national level implies an absence of a strong causal relationship (appendix). There are several limitations to using current global data. First, important between-country differences in the quality and representativeness of data are likely to exist. For example, blood cultures are less frequently taken in resource-poor settings than in resource-rich settings, and often only when patients do not respond to empirical therapy, leading to inflated estimates of resistance.4De Kraker ME Stewardson AJ Harbarth S Will 10 million people die a year due to antimicrobial resistance by 2050?.PLoS Med. 2016; 13: e1002184Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar Moreover, in lower income countries, a substantial proportion of antibiotics used might come from informal providers and not appear in consumption data. Both factors would be expected to weaken associations between reported antibiotic use and resistance, and could lead to positive associations between governance and infrastructure and antibiotic resistance, even if these factors have no effect on antibiotic resistance. Additionally, comparisons based on national-level data can be problematic, particularly when many countries have a sharp divide between subpopulations that overuse antibiotics and those that are without access. Patients lacking access to antibiotics are also less likely to have access to health-care facilities where blood samples are taken. Considering antibiotic consumption only on a national per capita basis could therefore considerably underestimate antibiotic consumption in subpopulations where resistance is being measured. Using a multivariable model will unfortunately not overcome such biases. Finally, the analysis simplifies antibiotic use such that the matter of which antibiotic is consumed is not considered, which will have importance in terms of resistance development.5Pouwels KB Freeman R Muller-Pebody B et al.Association between use of different antibiotics and trimethoprim resistance: going beyond the obvious crude association.J Antimicrob Chemother. 2018; 73: 1700-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar Combined antibiotic consumption measures might therefore not be optimal for determining the contribution of antibiotic consumption to resistance. While we welcome the central conclusion of the study about the need for efforts to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance in the community, we are concerned that fundamental limitations of the data could have led to an undervaluing of the role of antibiotic stewardship. We declare no competing interests. Download .pdf (.43 MB) Help with pdf files Supplementary appendix Antibiotic resistance, stewardship, and consumptionWe read with interest the work of Peter Collignon and colleagues,1 in which the authors studied the effect of cofactors on the prevalence of precise antibiotic resistance profiles. Amongst their discoveries, the authors identified inverse relationships between global antibiotic consumption and the antibiotic resistance profiles that they studied. Full-Text PDF Open AccessAntibiotic resistance, stewardship, and consumption – Authors' replyWe agree with Koen B Pouwels and colleagues, that association does not mean cause and effect. In our paper, we acknowledged limitations in using national-level data on antibiotic usage and resistance patterns, and that antibiotic use is an important factor in antibiotic resistance. We note that our results, which show that the spread of resistant bacteria by anthropological factors is at least as important as antibiotic use, are supported by other studies.1 Full-Text PDF Open AccessAnthropological and socioeconomic factors contributing to global antimicrobial resistance: a univariate and multivariable analysisReduction of antibiotic consumption will not be sufficient to control antimicrobial resistance because contagion—the spread of resistant strains and resistance genes—seems to be the dominant contributing factor. Improving sanitation, increasing access to clean water, and ensuring good governance, as well as increasing public health-care expenditure and better regulating the private health sector are all necessary to reduce global antimicrobial resistance.

    "ab": "BackgroundDeforestation and other forms of land use change are among the most pressing anthropogenic environmental impacts. In Brazil, a recent resurgence of malaria paralleled rapid deforestation and settlement in the Amazon basin, yet empirical evidence of a deforestation-driven increase in malaria remains surprisingly equivocal. We hypothesise that an underlying cause of this ambiguity is that deforestation and malaria influence each other in bidirectional causal relationships, where deforestation increases malaria through ecological mechanisms and malaria simultaneously reduces deforestation through socioeconomic mechanisms.MethodsWe tested our hypotheses with a large and robust geospatial dataset encompassing 807 municipalities across 13 years and show that deforestation has a strong positive effect on human malaria incidence, controlling for variation over space and time and across gradients of land use intensification.FindingsOur results suggest that a 10% increase in deforestation leads to a 3·7% increase in Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases (about 1730 additional cases in 2008). The effect is larger in the interior and absent on the fringe of the Amazon where little forest remains. However, this strong effect is only detectable after controlling for a feedback of malaria burden on forest loss, whereby increased malaria burden significantly reduces forest clearing, possibly mediated by human behaviour or economic development. We estimated that for a 1% increase in P falciparum malaria, we would expect a 1·5% decrease in forest area cleared (about 235 fewer km2 lost in 2008).InterpretationThis bidirectional socioecological feedback between deforestation and malaria, which attenuates as land use intensifies, shows the intimate ties between environmental change and human health.FundingUS National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology (#1611767).",

This central injustice puts the financial sector into focus because investment strategies can preserve the status quo or be a key factor for reaching the zero-emission-goal of the Paris Agreement. 5Millar RJ Hepburn C Beddington J Allen MR Principles to guide investment towards a stable climate.Nat Clim Change. 2018; 8: 2-4Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar In Germany, physicians' pension funds are controlled by democratically elected boards of the medical authorisations associations in each federal state, of which every physician is compulsorily a member. Hence, German physicians democratically control the investment strategies of their 18 pension funds. We are a group of German scientists interested in the role of physicians in mitigating the effects of climate change on health who joined efforts in an interdisciplinary project aimed at analysing the investment strategies of the German Physicians' pension funds. The primary goal was to investigate whether and how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria of sustainability are applied in investment decisions. A secondary goal was to quantify how much of the capital is invested according to ESG criteria. Supported by the GLS Bank (Bochum, Germany), an 18-item questionnaire was developed (appendix). We aimed to understand the standards and principles that are applied when selecting an investment and whether specific business sectors (eg, oil extraction) or practices (eg, exploitative child labour) are excluded in part or totally. Other items aimed to evaluate how quality is assured with respect to the application of ESG criteria (eg, which data sources are used for the analysis, how frequently sources are updated, and which control mechanisms are applied). Additionally, we screened the most recent business reports of the pension funds to quantify the investments with respect to asset classes. In April, 2019, we invited all advisory and supervisory boards of the 18 German physicians' pension funds to complete our questionnaire, ensuring anonymity for any data they would provide. 2 months later, 13 pension funds had responded to the invitation. However, none filled out the questionnaire. The most recent business reports of 12 pension funds showed capital investments of €75·4 billions (55% stocks, 19% fixed-interest-bearing securities, 5% real estates, and 21% other). Based thereupon, we estimated that the pension funds combined, including those that did not respond to our request, possess capital reserves of approximately €100 billions. The pension funds' individual responses to our invitation varied considerably. Nearly all provided explanations for not answering the questionnaire (four generally do not participate in studies, one refused because of the administrative burden, and the others claimed the questionnaire was not applicable to their situation) and stated that they consider aspects of sustainability, with many anticipating an increase in their investments in renewable energies in the coming years. Three pension funds defined yield as an aspect of sustainability and stated that, according to their investment guidelines, yield is prioritised over ESG criteria. Most pension funds noted that they consider ESG criteria in general, but did not provide details about how such criteria are defined or specify how much of the capital investments they are applied to. Many funds mentioned the UN Principles of Responsible Investment (PRI), which have to be signed by either asset managers or the institution itself (one fund signed). However, on the basis of available evidence2Watts N Amann M Arnell N et al.The 2018 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: shaping the health of nations for centuries to come.Lancet. 2018; 392: 2479-2514Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar and of current recommendations for actions to be taken by physicians against climate change,4German Medical Association (Model) Professional Code for Physicians in Germany.https://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/pdf-Ordner/MBO/MBO-AE_EN_2018.pdfDate: 2018Google Scholar, 6World Medical Association WMA declaration of Delhi on health and climate change.https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-delhi-on-health-and-climate-changeDate: 2017Google Scholar, 7US call to action on climate, health, and equity: a policy action agenda. 2019.https://climatehealthaction.org/cta/climate-health-equity-policyGoogle Scholar respecting the PRI is a minimal effort with respect to the implementation, application, and compliance with ESG criteria. One pension fund stated not to consider any ESG criteria and that, at the time of their response, their administration was waiting for suggestions from the umbrella organisation (ie, the association of German professional pension funds). Few pension funds provided more detailed data. One fund specified that the UN recommendations for sustainable development are respected in 83·0% of its investments with less than 0·5% of the capital invested in fossil fuels. Another fund mentioned that 5·3% of the capital is placed in infrastructure, of which three quarters are invested in the generation of renewable energies (which equals less than 4% of the fund's capital reserves). Since 2017, all the buildings the fund invests in are exclusively supplied with renewable energies. For new investments in buildings, a seal of approval from the German Sustainable Building Council is required. One fund claimed not to use paper for meetings any more, whereas another reported the construction of 120-megawatt renewable-energy power plants and that the buildings they invested in were awarded an ecological certification. Finally, two pension funds do not invest in cluster munition and one of them provided a list of 17 countries whose government bonds must not be bought or sold at short notice. It was disappointing that, despite assurance of anonymity for the data, none of the pension funds allowed us to gain a deeper insight into their investment strategies. Many managing boards appear to think that the consideration of ESG criteria might compromise the yield, although it has been evident for many years that considering ESG criteria would not affect economic interests and that, on the contrary, it is a prerequisite for an economically sustainable investment.8UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative A legal framework for the integration of environmental, social and governance issues into institutional investment.https://www.unepfi.org/fileadmin/documents/freshfields_legal_resp_20051123.pdfDate: 2005Google Scholar, 9Clark GL Feiner A Viehs M From the stockholder to the stakeholder: how sustainability can drive financial outperformance.https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2508281Date: 2015Google Scholar Millar and colleagues have published a set of principles of investment that can contribute to mitigate climate change.5Millar RJ Hepburn C Beddington J Allen MR Principles to guide investment towards a stable climate.Nat Clim Change. 2018; 8: 2-4Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar Their deliberations are founded on two facts: first, to stop global warming (at 1·5°C, 2°C, or even 4°C), carbon dioxide emissions must fall to zero and, second, the goal of the Paris Agreement is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero before reaching a 2°C temperature increase compared with preindustrial levels. Accordingly, organisations and companies are requested to develop a strategy to accomplish the zero-emission goal within a certain time span, to define intermediate steps, and to present a model of a zero-emission business that remains profitable.5Millar RJ Hepburn C Beddington J Allen MR Principles to guide investment towards a stable climate.Nat Clim Change. 2018; 8: 2-4Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar In conclusion, the elected boards of the German physicians' pension funds significantly underestimate how much respecting actual medical ethics is linked to sustainable investment strategies in the Anthropocene. The funds do not systematically apply and control ESG criteria in their investments. If any, only a small part of their huge capital reserves is invested according to ESG criteria. These choices do not correspond to a modern capital investment strategy and do not comply with the code of conduct of professional medical associations.4German Medical Association (Model) Professional Code for Physicians in Germany.https://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/pdf-Ordner/MBO/MBO-AE_EN_2018.pdfDate: 2018Google Scholar, 6World Medical Association WMA declaration of Delhi on health and climate change.https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-delhi-on-health-and-climate-changeDate: 2017Google Scholar, 7US call to action on climate, health, and equity: a policy action agenda. 2019.https://climatehealthaction.org/cta/climate-health-equity-policyGoogle Scholar, 10Law A Duff D Saunders P Middleton J McCoy D Medical organisations must divest from fossil fuels.BMJ. 2018; 363: k5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar Furthermore, ethical values seem negotiable when estimating the yield of an investment. Finally, physicians are an important voice in any society. Therefore, they should promote sustainable investment strategies according to ESG criteria as a matter of course in the health sector, in policies, and with patients for the conservation of natural resources, keeping in mind that such strategies do not preclude economic gains.

Some assessments have found a net benefit of climate change due to reduced cold temperature deaths offsetting increases in heat-related deaths.1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e367Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 2Guo Y Li S Li Liu D Chen D Williams G Tong S Projecting future temperature-related mortality in three largest Australian cities.Environ Pollut. 2016; 208: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Vicedo-Cabrera AM Guo Y Sera F et al.Temperature-related mortality impacts under and beyond Paris Agreement climate change scenarios.Clim Change. 2018; 150: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar Antonio Gasparrini and colleagues1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e367Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar and Vicedo-Cabrera and colleagues3Vicedo-Cabrera AM Guo Y Sera F et al.Temperature-related mortality impacts under and beyond Paris Agreement climate change scenarios.Clim Change. 2018; 150: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar found a net benefit of climate change for Australia, a surprising outcome given that other regions that experience cooler weather were associated with a net cost of climate change. Examples of the regions that were associated with a net cost of climate change in Gasparrini and colleagues'1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e367Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar and Vicedo-Cabrera and colleagues'3Vicedo-Cabrera AM Guo Y Sera F et al.Temperature-related mortality impacts under and beyond Paris Agreement climate change scenarios.Clim Change. 2018; 150: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar reports include North America, Central America, central Europe, southeast Asia, South America and southern Europe. In comparison to these regions, why Australia would have a net benefit from climate change is unclear, as it is a country associated with extreme heat rather than extreme cold. In 2018, I reported that Australian cities were adversely impacted by heat and had little cold-temperature mortality in an article published in Climatic Change.4Longden T Measuring temperature-related mortality using endogenously determined thresholds.Clim Change. 2018; 150: 343-375Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar The corresponding temperature-mortality relationship is a J-shaped curve, rather than the U-shaped curves reported by Gasparrini and colleagues.5Gasparrini A Guo Y Hashizume M et al.Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: a multicountry observational study.Lancet. 2015; 386: 369-375Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar This J-curve relationship implies that climate change is likely to increase the number of deaths in Australian cities in the future. A J-shaped curve has been reported before6Dang TN Seposo XT Duc NHC et al.Characterizing the relationship between temperature and mortality in tropical and subtropical cities: a distributed lag non-linear model analysis in Hue, Viet Nam, 2009–2013.Glob Health Action. 2016; 9: 28738Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Lee W Kim H Hwang S Zanobetti A Schwartz JD Chung Y Monte Carlo simulation-based estimation for the minimum mortality temperature in temperature-mortality association study.BMC Med Res Methodol. 2017; 17: 137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Egondi T Kyobutungi C Kovats S Muindi K Ettarh R Rocklöv J Time-series analysis of weather and mortality patterns in Nairobi's informal settlements.Glob Health Action. 2012; 5: 19065Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Cui Y Yin F Deng Y et al.Heat or cold: which one exerts greater deleterious effects on health in a basin climate city?

Although Gasparrini and colleagues1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e367Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar used a statistically determined minimum mortality temperature to distinguish between heat-related and cold-related mortality, this reference temperature can be quite warm. For example, the minimum mortality temperature for Melbourne was very high and equal to the 90th percentile (ie, an average daily temperature of 22·4°C compared with the mean average daily temperature of 18·1°C reported for Australia).1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e367Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar A high minimum mortality temperature could mean that deaths during average temperatures are associated with cold-related mortality rather than being treated as deaths during moderate (usual) temperatures. By contrast, in my article4Longden T Measuring temperature-related mortality using endogenously determined thresholds.Clim Change. 2018; 150: 343-375Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar I used endogenous threshold regressions and a temperature measure that accounts for acclimatisation to distinguish between heat-related and cold-related mortality. This Excess Heat Index that accounts for acclimatisation (EHI_A) is part of the Excess Heat Factor produced by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. It is the 3-day average temperature minus the 30-day average temperature. The measure has a mean of 0°C, which is a useful reference temperature that can be compared with 3-day periods that are hotter or colder than the previous 30 days. To distinguish between heat-related and cold-related mortality, I used the thresholds determined by this estimation technique to classify the estimated mortality into the number of deaths during cold temperatures (EHI_A at <−3·51°C), moderate temperatures (EHI_A at ≥−3·51°C and <1·95°C), hot temperatures (EHI_A at ≥1·95°C and <7·26°C), and extreme heat (EHI_A at ≥7·26°C). Consistent with the thresholds estimated, most temperature-related deaths in Australia were associated with high and extremely high temperature events. In some regressions a negative relationship with cold temperatures was apparent, which is plausible given that winters in Australia are quite mild. My article indicated that the risk from future temperature events in Australian capital cities will be associated with extreme heat and hot temperature events rather than cold temperature events, in contrast to the previous results.1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e367Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 3Vicedo-Cabrera AM Guo Y Sera F et al.Temperature-related mortality impacts under and beyond Paris Agreement climate change scenarios.Clim Change. 2018; 150: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Gasparrini A Guo Y Hashizume M et al.Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: a multicountry observational study.Lancet. 2015; 386: 369-375Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar I believe that further analysis is warranted to confirm whether the reference temperatures used to distinguish between heat-related and cold-related mortality are appropriate given the prevailing climate in Australia. I declare no competing interests. Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenariosThis study shows the negative health impacts of climate change that, under high-emission scenarios, would disproportionately affect warmer and poorer regions of the world. Comparison with lower emission scenarios emphasises the importance of mitigation policies for limiting global warming and reducing the associated health risks.

    "ab": "BackgroundIn 2016, 23% of children younger than 5 years were stunted. Global-level modelling has consistently found that climate change impacts on food production are likely to impair progress on reducing undernutrition. We adopt a new perspective, assessing how climate change may affect child stunting via its impacts on two interacting socioeconomic drivers: incomes of the poorest 20% of populations and food prices.MethodsWe developed a statistical model, driven by upstream poverty and food price models, to project moderate and severe stunting in children younger than 5 years in rural and urban areas in 2030 under low and high climate change scenarios combined with poverty and prosperity scenarios in 44 countries.FindingsWe estimated that, in the absence of climate change, 110 million children younger than 5 years would be stunted in 2030 under the poverty scenario in comparison with 83 million under the prosperity scenario. Estimates of climate change-attributable stunting ranged from 570 000 under the prosperity/low climate change scenario to more than 1 million under the poverty/high climate change scenario. The projected impact of climate change on stunting was greater in rural versus urban areas under both socioeconomic scenarios. Patterns in the results showed that, in countries where incomes remain low and food prices are relatively high (compared with incomes), further price rises tend to increase stunting. In contrast, in countries where incomes rise and food prices are relatively low, slowly rising prices tend to decrease stunting.InterpretationShifting the focus from food production to interactions between incomes and food price has provided new insights. The patterns in the results suggest that food prices that provide decent incomes to farmers alongside high employment with living wages will reduce undernutrition and vulnerability to climate change. Futures that protect health should consider not just availability, accessibility, and quality of food, but also the incomes generated by those producing the food.FundingThe research was partially funded by the Office of the Chief Economist of the Climate Change Group and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery of the World Bank, and the NIHR Health Research Health Protection Research Unit in Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in partnership with Public Health England (PHE), and in collaboration with the University of Exeter, University College London, and the Met Office. The views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the World Bank, NHS, the NIHR, the Department of Health, or Public Health England.",

The framework's goal is to help achieve a sustainable future for humanity3Steffen W, Richardson K, Rockstrom J, et al. Planetary boundaries: guiding human development on a changing planet. Science 201; 47: 1259855.Google Scholar by suggesting safe limits to the nine dimensions. This framework allows to measure such limits by using a combination of warning sign, threshold, and regime shift indicators. The transgression of the framework's boundaries through the misuse and misallocation of resources has undesired consequences to global functions and cycles of Earth's life-supporting systems and is leading to the disturbance of complex ecological and physicochemical equilibria to a degree beyond their natural resilience. The framework and its use has sparked interest within the scientific, societal, and political communities.3Steffen W, Richardson K, Rockstrom J, et al.

More specifically, agriculture entangles the key biogeophysical building blocks of the biosphere—biomass, soil, and water—which need protection from environmental and management related risks through policy decision making. This is important because the geopolitics of biomass, water, and land are driving the new resource scarcities,7Mathijs E Brunori G Carus M et al.Sustainable agriculture, forestry and fisheries in the Bioeconomy—a challenge for Europe.https://ec.europa.eu/research/scar/pdf/feg4_final.pdf#view=fit&pagemode=noneDate: 2015Date accessed: April 28, 2018Google Scholar, 8Gabriel-Oyhamburu K Le retour d'une géopolitique des ressources?.L'Espace Politique. 2011; 12: 1-15Google Scholar which are causing conflict between national security and international order mechanisms.

It is generated through ocean acidification; more general atmospheric, land, and water pollutions; waste accumulation; and climate change. The corresponding chemical intensification affects societies daily on a large scale: 144 000 types of chemicals are manufactured, with a 500-fold increase in volume over the last several decades.9UN Environment ProgrammeGlobal chemicals outlook: synthesis report for decision-makers.http://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/8264Date: 2012Date accessed: September 15, 2018Google Scholar The result is a so-called mega-pollution system consisting of complex chemical cocktails in the environment (eg, pesticides, endocrine disruptors, antibiotics, and microplastics) that interact with the natural chemical world1Lomborg B The skeptical environmentalist: measuring the real state of the world. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2001Crossref Google Scholar and change over space and time. This makes it hard, and sometimes impossible, to measure, understand, and control the exposure to a mixture of chemicals for which safe limits for polluting factors have to be estimated with regard to exposure to any single chemical.1Lomborg B The skeptical environmentalist: measuring the real state of the world. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2001Crossref Google Scholar Current standards are based on studies that have been done on one chemical at a time. Mixing different chemicals can result in additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects. For example, simple chemical mixtures that consist of five pesticides found in food commodities showed additive to synergistic genotoxic effects in cultured cells.10Graillot V Takakura N Le Hegarat L et al.Genotoxicity mixtures present in the diet of the French population.Environ Mol Mutagen. 2012; 53: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar Consequently, a detailed knowledge of the response to all possible combinations of chemical risk factors implies dividing the limit value for an individual factor by the square root of the number of factors under consideration. Although this calculation would be unrealistic in practice, it suggests that the adoption of limit values two or three orders of magnitude smaller than those estimated by single factor impact studies1Lomborg B The skeptical environmentalist: measuring the real state of the world. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2001Crossref Google Scholar is relevant to legislation. However, this is a problem: prevention protocols, standards, and legislation are not well adapted to the scale of risks operating in constantly evolving environments. Agriculture and physicochemical deregulation act in synergy, are first order systemic risks to planetary health2Acunzo D Escher G Ottersen OP et al.Framing planetary health: arguing for research centred science.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e101-e102Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar with long-term effects on the society. For example, the health and economic burden of conventional food systems and global pollution is estimated to cost trillions of US dollars annually and contribute to millions of deaths globally.11International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food SystemsUnravelling the food-health nexus.http://www.ipesfood.org/images/Reports/Health_FullReport.pdfDate: 2017Date accessed: April 15, 2018Google Scholar, 12Ghebreyesus TA Acting on NCDs: counting the cost.Lancet. 2018; 391: 1973-1974Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar Low-income countries are the most affected. We argue that the health and economic burden constitutes a systemic challenge (so-called health bubble), which government and society will have to address over the next decade. Therefore, we call for, first, coordinated measures that target planetary health through coherent chemical simplification (effectively reduce, redesign, and recycle to make better use of a smaller number of different chemicals) in transitions to societies that decrease their use of resources and are resource efficient.2Acunzo D Escher G Ottersen OP et al.Framing planetary health: arguing for research centred science.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e101-e102Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 13Haines A Hanson C Ranganathan J Planetary Health Watch: integrated monitoring in the Anthropocene epoch.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e141-e143Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar This measure could also help to slow down climate change.

The earthquakes in Nepal in 2015 had a tectonic origin; however, the huge losses it caused (9000 deaths, 18 000 injuries, and >500 000 households and 1000 health facilities damaged) could have been mitigated if there had been a rapid response.2Adhikari B Mishra SR Babu Marahatta S et al.Earthquakes, fuel crisis, power outages, and health care in Nepal: implications for the future.Disaster Med Public Health Prep. 2017; 11: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar Environmental losses from the earthquakes have been overlooked. Ongoing rampant urban development coupled with unsystematic recovery efforts after the earthquake has had the greatest toll on lives. Overlooking the planetary health agendas that arose from these earthquakes will continue to threaten the existence of one of the oldest civilisations of southern Asia. In this Comment, we identify and discuss key challenges that need to be addressed immediately and could be part of local advocacy. The National Reconstruction Authority (NRA)—a legally mandated agency for leading the earthquake recovery and reconstruction efforts in Nepal—estimated that US$7 billion are required for rebuilding, of which $2·9 billion were to be sourced internally.3Adhikari N Nepal's earthquake disaster: two years and $4·1bn later.https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/04/nepal-earthquake-disaster-years-41bn-170412110550808.htmlDate: 2017Date accessed: April 1, 2018Google Scholar Still, 3 years after the earthquakes, the NRA has only managed to disburse 16% of the total 4.1 billion USD pledged by donors. The owners of only 544 996 of 900 000 damaged houses have received their first payment, which accounts for only 17% of the total reconstruction grants.3Adhikari N Nepal's earthquake disaster: two years and $4·1bn later.https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/04/nepal-earthquake-disaster-years-41bn-170412110550808.htmlDate: 2017Date accessed: April 1, 2018Google Scholar People from impoverished communities, who are at high health risk, are the most heavily affected by this lumbering distribution of funds. The impact of the earthquakes on the economically vulnerable population has been rising steadily, and has caused an increase in the illegal sale of organs (such as kidneys) to pay for costs of living.4Cousins S Nepal: organ trafficking after the earthquake.Lancet. 2016; 387: 833Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 5Adhikari B Organ and human trafficking in Nepal.Lancet. 2016; 387: 1907Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar The increase in employment abroad has caused a huge proportion of male labour to migrate to Gulf nations, leaving thousands of families split.

The momentum for building back better has dampened, particularly as conventional construction methods without retrofits have been used in rebuilding the houses. The extensive extraction of clay soil for bricks, deforestation to supply wood to kilns and construction, and extraction of sand from quarries are causing concern. In a community-based study in Nepal, more than half of the respondents felt the impacts of climate change, such as a rise in temperature and episodes of droughts.7Mishra SR Bhandari PM Issa R Neupane D Gurung S Khanal V Climate change and adverse health events: community perceptions from the Tanahu district of Nepal.Environl Res Lett. 2015; 10: 034007Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar Indiscriminate sand and gravel extraction and deforestation in Nepal's southern plains have failed to draw the government's attention or to prompt it to take action. Increased overexploitation of ecosystem resources causes deepening and widening of river beds, which in turn affect the flow of surface water. Unsurprisingly, the consequences of deepening and widening of river beds have been evident in the flooding patterns in past years. In 2017, 160 people were killed and 26 went missing in a major flood that inundated the southern planes of Nepal, stretching over an area of 1355 km2 that borders India.8Uprety A Ozaki A Senoo Y et al.Flood damage in Nepal exacerbated by underlying conflict with India.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e351-e352Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar The unsystematic reconstruction continues to affect air quality in Kathmandu.

Heavy-duty trucks carrying construction materials in the narrow and winding roads of the capital, coupled with high-speed driving practices have increased the number of road-traffic accidents. More than 2385 deaths were attributed to road traffic accidents in 2016–17, a 16% increase compared with the previous year.9Times THRoad accident fatalities continue unabated.https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/road-accident-fatalities-continue-unabated/Date: 2017Date accessed: April 2, 2018Google Scholar Air pollution in Kathmandu is worsened by CO2 emissions from vehicles and brick-kilns located in and outside the valley. An ongoing potable-water pipeline project has further added to the amount of dust in Kathmandu. The air quality index in Kathmandu exceeds the threshold established by WHO (the air quality index was reported to be >200, which indicates poor air quality), during all days of the week.10US Embassy K, Nepal Air PollutionUS Embassy, Kathmandu air pollution: real-time air quality index (AQI).http://Aqicn.Org/City/Nepal/Kathmandu/Us-Embassy/Date: 2018Date accessed: April 1, 2018Google Scholar Concern for the situation has been repeatedly raised by WHO, other health agencies, and civil society, but it has yet to be addressed. Uncoordinated and inappropriate construction methods have also put Nepal's cultural heritage at risk. The reconstruction of one of the most iconic sites of Kathmandu, Rani Pokhari, was started with concrete and mortar, but was halted after widespread resistance from the public and environmentalists. Reconstruction of Dharahara, a tower built two centuries ago, is still uncertain. 822 monuments from seven UNESCO heritage sites were either partially or completely destroyed and await reconstruction.11Himalaya E UNESCO World Heritage Sites.https://www.explorehimalaya.com/nepal-information/unesco-world-heritage-sites/Date: 2018Date accessed: April 2, 2018Google Scholar In 2017, UNESCO cautioned against the government's current practice of reconstruction, particularly the practice of selecting the lowest bidder to take the contract even if they do not have proper specifications and craftsmanship, and stated that poor maintenance of these sites could be deadlier than earthquakes themselves.12UNESCOProtecting cultural heritage: lessons from the Gorkha Earthquake.https://en.unesco.org/news/protecting-cultural-heritage-lessons-gorkha-earthquakeDate: 2018Date accessed: April 2, 2018Google Scholar One of the cornerstones of planetary health is sustainability—ie, the ability to sustain our lives and civilization without putting a strain on countries' economies and ecosystems. Nepal's need for sustainable resources to drive the rebuilding process has only been recognised recently, but many donor-funded projects will end soon. The exhaustion of donor funding probably means that in later years Nepal will have to manage the postearthquake recovery process alone, and substantial local resources will need to be mobilised. Quoting a recent media report13Times THForeign aid commitment down nearly 30 percent.https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/foreign-aid-commitment-nearly-30-per-cent/Date: 2016Date accessed: April 2, 2018Google Scholar of a 30% drop in external assistance, we further highlight the need for an economic rebuilding process, such as through community engagement. Since the earthquakes, Nepal has already seen three governments, and political interference with NRA has grown out of proportion. The gaps in the regulatory mechanism and the lack of transparency of progress,14Lee AC Barriers to evidence-based disaster management in Nepal: a qualitative study.Public Health. 2016; 133: 99-106Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar which have left the Government of Nepal alone in rebuilding, can lead to another year of futility. The formation of a task force that combines the NRA, members of the donor agencies, and neutral observers (eg, UN or other independent international authorities) could become an operational tool. Such a task force could enhance the operational management for reconstruction by widely engaging with the stakeholders and the affected communities, the members of which need to be involved, trained, and given responsibilities.15Newnham E Patrick K Balsari S Leaning J Community engagement in disaster planning and response.https://cdn2.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Community-Preparedness-Policy-Brief-10.28.15.pdfDate: 2015Date accessed: April 1, 2018Google Scholar, 16Adhikari B Mishra SR Raut S Rebuilding Earthquake Struck Nepal through Community Engagement.Front Public Health. 2016; 4: 121Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar Stakeholders and community members with increased awareness of planetary health can themselves become the foundation of a sustainable and environmentally friendly rebuilding movement.

    "ab": "Adaptation to the health effects of climate change and mitigation of the associated health risks is a global health policy issue that requires local and regional cooperation along with adequate resource allocation. However, following the withdrawal of the USA from the Paris climate accord, a new model of global climate response needs to be enforced, considering the urgency of these health effects among the low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) of the global south.1Watts N Adger WN Ayeb-Karlsson S et al.The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1151-1164Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar Regional, national, and local actors need to be involved, thinking globally and acting locally. Although building capacity in local and regional policy leadership necessitates the involvement of educators, the multisectoral nature of the problem demands the use of learning approaches that are interprofessional and inquiry-based. Hence, we propose the use of academic, parliamentary-style health policy debates for building capacity in climate leadership among today's students—ie, the policy leaders of tomorrow. Many such debates in the past have mimicked the World Health Assembly and its global scope. However, simulations of regional and local diplomatic bodies allow for a focused deliberation and the voicing of relevant, evidence-informed arguments. In an example of a regionally focused health policy debate, an interprofessional group of students from both health and non-health professions participated in the Manipal Model WHO 2018 (at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India), where they debated approaches for adapting to and mitigating against the health effects of climate change in the south Asian region.2The Hindu Students debate climate change, health at Manipal Model WHO.https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/students-debate-climate-change-health-at-manipal-model-who/article22758003.eceDate: Feb 16, 2018Google Scholar By receiving targeted instruction in health research literacy, parliamentary debate procedure, public speaking, and drafting policy documents, students showed key interprofessional and leadership skills to reach mutual consensus on the way forward. By building on existing generic WHO frameworks, they developed and voted on draft resolutions that presented region-specific policy plans to address local health effects. Similar health policy debates in education for health professionals have also been done in other LMICs, such as the Medical Model UN (ie, MedMUN 2014 and MedMUN 2015) in Malaysia involving only issue-appropriate nations.3Godinho MA Murthy S Ali Mohammed C Debating evidence-based health policy in an interprofessional classroom: an exploratory study.J Interprof Care. 2018; (published online Oct 31)DOI:10.1080/13561820.2018.1541873PubMed Google Scholar Likewise the National Health System 2017, a national health assembly simulation in Sudan,4Godinho MA Murthy S Ciraj AM Health policy for health professions students: building capacity for community advocacy in developing nations.Educ Health. 2017; 30: 254-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar debated domestic and regional issues specific to the region. These examples show that the local expertise for organising and conducting such debates is available in LMICs. Disseminated efforts and targeted interventions to mobilise this expertise can provide much needed opportunities for building local and regional policy leadership to address the health effects of climate change, specifically in LMICs. We declare no competing interests. The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate changeThe Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change is an international, multidisciplinary research collaboration between academic institutions and practitioners across the world. It follows on from the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission, which concluded that the response to climate change could be “the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century”. The Lancet Countdown aims to track the health impacts of climate hazards; health resilience and adaptation; health co-benefits of climate change mitigation; economics and finance; and political and broader engagement.

    "ab": "Climate can affect individual health through a number of mechanisms, including changes in food access or availability, heat stress, and drought. Each of these mechanisms are mediated by decisions that individuals, households, and communities make, and so associations between climate change and health outcomes that do not account for these pathways can disguise true effects. In a recent study examining the link between climate variables and health in Mali and Kenya, authors found compelling evidence that precipitation, temperature, and vegetation all have an effect on birthweight.1Bakhtsiyarava M Grace K Nawrotzki RJ Climate, birth weight, and agricultural livelihoods in Kenya and Mali.Am J Public Health. 2018; 108: S144-S150Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar A similar study examined how the climatic characteristics of a region affected growth trajectories of children under five years of age, including potentially moderating variables like transportation and health infrastructure.2Shively GE Infrastructure mitigates the sensitivity of child growth to local agriculture and rainfall in Nepal and Uganda.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2017; 114: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar Both studies note that although rainfall during key periods is typically associated with positive growth trajectories, quantitative associations are heterogeneous across individuals. Moreover, the associations are not fully explained after controlling for variation due to land use, food availability, infrastructure, or individual-level or household-level characteristics. Climate-health researchers have attributed the unexplained variation to a range of factors, from the adoption of modern agricultural techniques, to transportation and health infrastructure, to nutrition and care practices. The pathways proposed in quantitative climate-health studies generally come from qualitative assessments of context made by the researchers, but the directionality of those pathways is not always clear.3Amegah AK Rezza G Jaakkola JJ Temperature-related morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review of the empirical evidence.Environ Int. 2016; 91: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Phalkey RK Aranda-Jan C Marx S Höfle B Sauerborn R Systematic review of current efforts to quantify the impacts of climate change on undernutrition.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2015; 112: e4522-e4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar For instance, studies focused on investigating the association between malnutrition and climate propose that the relationship between weather conditions and child health outcomes can be partially explained by the ways a caretaker's workload changes in response to weather. In theory, children are healthier when caretakers have adequate time to care for the children.5Hampshire KR Panter-Brick C Kilpatrick K Casiday RE Saving lives, preserving livelihoods: understanding risk, decision-making and child health in a food crisis.Soc Sci Med. 2009; 68: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar In practice, increased rainfall could result in greater crop yields, but create more demand for a caretaker's labor, leaving children to eat less frequently.6Jones AD Cruz Agudo Y Galway L Bentley J Pinstrup-Andersen P Heavy agricultural workloads and low crop diversity are strong barriers to improving child feeding practices in the Bolivian Andes.Soc Sci Med. 2012; 75: 1673-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Nankumbi J Muliira JK Barriers to infant and child-feeding practices: a qualitative study of primary caregivers in rural Uganda.J Health Popul Nutr. 2015; 33: 106-116PubMed Google Scholar Equally, dry conditions and high temperatures could result in more time on heatwave mitigation efforts and less time focused on childcare. It is also possible that extreme temperatures force individuals to spend more time indoors or close to home, resulting in more time left for caretaking. This example shows how individuals can have different responses to the same extreme weather conditions, resulting in varying health outcomes. Because responses to climate are highly contextual, quantitative analyses that do not explicitly model relevant aspects of the local context can produce misleading results. To advance climate-health research and associated policies, the research community should focus on identifying, isolating, and understanding the different ways that individuals respond to climate events. Strictly quantitative analyses have provided promising insights into climate-health linkages but are limited in their ability to capture experiences relevant to local contexts and cultures.8Nelson DM Who counts? The mathematics of death and life after genocide. Duke University Press, Durham, NC, USA2015Crossref Google Scholar To capture variability in these dynamics, attention must be paid to local norms surrounding the ways that people interact and spend their time. Local stakeholders (all individuals in an area, including those living in the communities of interest as well as local policymakers, health workers, and educators) manage complex risks in everyday practice, and using available resources and risk mitigation strategies can provide valuable insights into research. These local stakeholders can provide unique perspectives on a range of highly relevant behavioural responses, including those related to time management, food rationing, caretaking practices, and other strategies used to reduce the adverse effects of climate change. Accessing and chronicling this information allows researchers and policy makers to better determine the ways a household and community respond to aberrant climate events. Unfortunately, standard demographic and health surveys used for climate-health research rarely capture local norms surrounding the ways that people interact. To remedy this, we suggest augmenting climate-health research with qualitative methodologies and field work at every stage, to advance scientific and policy understanding of the effects of climate change on health. Three areas of qualitative research can be used to inform and augment research findings: context, perspectives, and policy. To promote contextual understanding, researchers could focus on a particular phenomenon or process of interest and find a systematic way to observe the way that a process unfolds. For example, Shively2Shively GE Infrastructure mitigates the sensitivity of child growth to local agriculture and rainfall in Nepal and Uganda.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2017; 114: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar found that rainfall at key developmental junctures affected growth trajectories in children under five years of age. Making specific policy recommendations based on these findings is difficult, but contextual studies might focus on how care practices are likely to be affected by rainfall at different ages, including how increases in rainfall may affect agricultural yields and demands for labour. Such studies of context involve techniques like ethnographies and broader-level ethnographic methods (including living in and engaging with communities, languages, and cultures), and start with the assumption that there are well-thought-out adaptive processes being implemented by members of the community. Context is not an attempt to understand everything about a country or culture, but rather an attempt to develop a culturally informed understanding of the object under study, including climate and food production, or climate and child care. Researchers observe the ways in which those processes unfold pre-intervention, asking questions of local informants, generally guided by or facilitated by local research associates. Data is generated via field notes kept by researchers. Although contextual studies might include talking with local stakeholders, studying perspectives would generally include interviews or focus group discussions. These interviews could then be used to provide additional information on the mechanisms, motivations, or cultural values underpinning an observation of interest. In the case of birth seasonality, for example, studies of perspectives could use focus group interviews to establish if women feel capable of choosing the time of year they become pregnant, or how important seasonal hunger patterns are in the choice to exclusively breast feed and in the duration of breastfeeding behaviour.9Grace K Considering climate in studies of fertility and reproductive health in poor countries.Nat Clim Chang. 2017; 7: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar This method assumes that stakeholders make decisions and act in ways that reflect a strategic calculation of risks and benefits, and so the processes underpinning those calculations can be better understood by directly asking about their motivations and behaviours. Perspectives can be gained through conversations with various stakeholders and the list of questions can be rigid or flexible. In more exploratory cases it is generally best practice to use focus groups with a semi-structured protocol, because participants can discuss the topic together and come to a consensus. Flexible lists of questions allow researchers to ask about contradictions or rich points as they emerge.10Agar MH Ethnography: an overview.Subst Use Misuse. 1997; 32: 1155-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar Interviews are often recorded and transcribed, and a qualitative researcher will use those written transcripts to look for themes that help provide insight into mechanisms, motivations, or values. Policy research can include a variety of tools, but is often based on conversations with policy makers or other officials entrusted with decision making and resource brokering. Interviews are useful in gaining insight into the history or justification of a policy or in understanding previous efforts to remedy a particular problem. Lists of questions can be rigid or flexible, and interviews are often transcribed and redacted to serve as data for later publication. Policy research can also be expanded to include archival research that consists of legal proceedings, newspapers, and other documents that might provide additional insight into the broader political context. Analysis of policy data looks similar to analysis of interview transcripts. Qualitative researchers might begin by looking at all instances of the word or phrase heatwaves or climate change in local media. Next, they might use those documents to identify elements of a pre-existing theory, or answer questions regarding public perceptions of heatwaves or climate change and how those have evolved over time. In conclusion, qualitative approaches can be used to design empirical studies that capture culturally informed perspectives by willingly participating stakeholders. Engagement with local stakeholders should begin in the very early stages of research design, and should be revisited throughout the duration of the study. Interactions with stakeholders can be systematic, scientific, and documented for the purposes of reliability and reproducibility, and importantly, should be published to facilitate access by the scientific community. Bringing everyday lived experiences of individuals into quantitative climate-change research can help ensure that science and policy reflects the strategies that local people are already using to protect their health, and addresses the concerns and challenges facing those who are most vulnerable.

Air pollution exposure during pregnancy is associated with reduced postnatal lung function,2 and several studies also show a sustained effect of prenatal air pollution exposure on lung function at age 5 weeks up to age 11 years.",

Other concepts, such as eco health, planetary health, future earth, and future health, although different all refer to a similar policy, encouraging different audiences to reach a global consensus on health.2Khan MS Rothman-Ostrow P Spencer J et al.The growth and strategic functioning of One Health networks: a systematic analysis.Lancet Plan Health. 2018; 2: e264-e273Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar Epidemic intelligence and the ability to identify an outbreak early can provide a crucial advantage in the eradication of infectious diseases, prompting response to prevent epidemics and the implementation of biological countermeasures.3Edelstein M Lee LM Herten-Crabb A Heymann DL Harper DR Strengthening global public health surveillance through data and benefit sharing.Emerg Infect Dis. 2018; 24: 1324Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar In 1851, when the World Health Assembly, WHO, and the International Health Regulations (IHR) were not yet established, after epidemics of cholera, plague, and yellow fever, the first International Sanitary Conference was held. 14 conferences and many years later, WHO was established.4Fidler DP From international sanitary conventions to global health security: the new International Health Regulations.Chin J Int Law. 2005; 4: 325-392Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar The aims of the International Sanitary Conference were legislation, enforcement of the reporting of the status of contagious diseases, and encouragement of international cooperation in controlling infectious diseases. The concerns of the 19th century are still concerns of today, giving rise to an urgent need to deal with these issues.4Fidler DP From international sanitary conventions to global health security: the new International Health Regulations.Chin J Int Law. 2005; 4: 325-392Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar Although the IHR came into effect in June, 2007, in practice, at that time there was little incentive to allow external investigation of a country's progress in dealing with epidemics. After the establishment of the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), political will increased and integrated logistical support for the Global Health Security was provided by national institutes and agencies, international organisations, and donors, resulting in more than 40 countries allowing external evaluation of their One Health infrastructure within 3 years.5Kandel N Sreedharan R Chungong S et al.Joint external evaluation process: bringing multiple sectors together for global health security.Lancet Glob Health. 2017; 5: e857-e858Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar The effects of the IHR JEE on the evaluation of One Health performance in the Middle East and north Africa, with the participation of 14 countries, revealed that more than 90% had an established surveillance system; however, only half had the capacity to monitor one to four zoonotic diseases. More than 80% of the countries had fundamental problems with the national stewardship plan for antimicrobial resistance.6Al Abaidani I Mohamednour SAS Addressing challenges in the Middle East at the human–animal interface under the 'One Health' concept. 14th Conference of the OIE Regional Commission for the Middle East; Istanbul, Turkey.http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Publications_%26_Documentation/docs/pdf/TT/2017_MO2_AlAbaidani.pdfDate: Oct 2–6, 2017Date accessed: March 20, 2019Google Scholar The effects of non-human epidemics are not limited to zoonotic diseases; the economic effect of mass depopulation and biodiversity loss ignites social inequity and unrest because of the complexity of social determinants of health. Additionally, financial instability will result from focusing solely on the human sector, at the cost of the animal kingdom and ecosystem. The political, economic, and societal consequences of epidemics of animal and zoonotic diseases (including, but not limited to, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, highly pathogenic avian influenza, and foot-and-mouth disease) in the Middle East and north Africa over the past decade indicates that it is time to direct more attention to the animal kingdom and the environment. The implementation of any policy and practice under the One Health and planetary health umbrellas will guarantee sustained success.2Khan MS Rothman-Ostrow P Spencer J et al.The growth and strategic functioning of One Health networks: a systematic analysis.Lancet Plan Health. 2018; 2: e264-e273Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Rushton J Bruce M Bellet C et al.Initiation of global burden of animal diseases programme.Lancet. 2018; 392: 538-540Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar If we look at the status of the countries of the Middle East and north Africa in controlling the outbreaks of animal and zoonotic diseases, as well as overcoming environmental challenges such as environmental damage, air pollution, drought and scarce fresh water, and a paucity of arable land, the most important initial step should be the establishment of a governing body to oversee an integrated One Health surveillance system for the early detection of threats at the animal–human–ecosystems interfaces.3Edelstein M Lee LM Herten-Crabb A Heymann DL Harper DR Strengthening global public health surveillance through data and benefit sharing.Emerg Infect Dis. 2018; 24: 1324Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Al Abaidani I Mohamednour SAS Addressing challenges in the Middle East at the human–animal interface under the 'One Health' concept. 14th Conference of the OIE Regional Commission for the Middle East; Istanbul, Turkey.http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Publications_%26_Documentation/docs/pdf/TT/2017_MO2_AlAbaidani.pdfDate: Oct 2–6, 2017Date accessed: March 20, 2019Google Scholar The challenges of the implementation of such a system should be carefully investigated. It might be that the experience of a public–private partnership such as the Middle East Consortium on Infectious Disease Surveillance (MECIDS) in a region, which has a history of decades of challenges, could be extended to other countries in the Middle East and north Africa.8Kimball AM Moore M French HM et al.Regional infectious disease surveillance networks and their potential to facilitate the implementation of the international health regulations.Med Clin North Am. 2008; 92: 1459-1471Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Stärk KD Kuribreña MA Dauphin G et al.One Health surveillance–more than a buzz word?.Prev Vet Med. 2015; 120: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar The most serious challenge is developing the political will to support not just the establishment of an integrated surveillance system, but also intersectoral partnerships to help prevent and control diseases.3Edelstein M Lee LM Herten-Crabb A Heymann DL Harper DR Strengthening global public health surveillance through data and benefit sharing.Emerg Infect Dis. 2018; 24: 1324Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Kandel N Sreedharan R Chungong S et al.Joint external evaluation process: bringing multiple sectors together for global health security.Lancet Glob Health. 2017; 5: e857-e858Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar Considering decades of conflict, war, and unrest, the main question remains whether leaders in the Middle East and north Africa are willing to collaborate to implement the One Health surveillance system. The Seventh World Health Summit Regional Meeting to be held in Iran offers an exceptional opportunity to promote One Health and planetary health in the region. Topics such as health in uncertain situations, non-communicable diseases and mental health, global health in a transitional world, planetary health, and medical education are all emerging fields that stakeholders and decision makers from all around the globe can produce an operational plan for achieving their goals. Without a doubt, this will only be possible with the support of domestic policy makers and upstream policies. We declare no competing interests.",

    "ab": "The incidence of pregnancy loss is about 28% in preconception cohorts,1Buck Louis GM Schisterman EF Sweeney AM et al.Designing prospective cohort studies for assessing reproductive and developmental toxicity during sensitive windows of human reproduction and development--the LIFE Study.Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2011; 25: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar and self-reported prevalence of pregnancy loss is increasing in the USA.2Rossen LM Ahrens KA Branum AM Trends in risk of pregnancy loss among US women, 1990–2011.Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2018; 32: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar The causes of most pregnancy losses are unclear, posing a major challenge for intervention efforts. Mounting evidence suggests that air pollution might affect embryonic and fetal development in both in vitro and population-based studies.3Legro RS Sauer MV Mottla GL et al.Effect of air quality on assisted human reproduction.Hum Reprod. 2010; 25: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Munch EM Sparks AE Duran HE Van Voorhis BJ Lack of carbon air filtration impacts early embryo development.J Assist Reprod Genet. 2015; 32: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Mendola P Ha S Pollack AZ et al.Chronic and acute ozone exposure in the week prior to delivery is associated with the risk of stillbirth.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2017; 14: E731Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Ha S Liu D Zhu Y et al.Ambient temperature and stillbirth: a multi-center retrospective cohort study.Environ Health Perspect. 2017; 125: 067011Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar However, few studies have explored whether air pollution affects the risk of pregnancy loss, particularly in low-income areas of the world where the incidence is high. The scarcity of studies investigating the effects of air pollution on the risk of pregnancy loss is partly driven by the scarcity of available data coupled with the challenges associated with prospectively monitoring pregnancy loss and personal air monitoring. Existing studies often use retrospective data on known pregnancy or live births because of accessibility. This presents a crucial limitation because a considerable proportion of pregnancy losses occur early, even before entry into the health-care system. Thus, retrospective data cannot adequately capture early losses, leading to a missed opportunity to explore more upstream effects of air pollution. The second challenge involves assessment of air pollution. Personal exposures are commonly estimated using local stationary air monitors or mathematical models. Although feasible, these methods do not effectively capture small spatiotemporal variations in air pollution, especially because most women are mobile. These sources of measurement error are generally thought to be non-differential, adding random error that will bias study results towards the null. To better understand the causal relationship between air pollution and pregnancy loss, it is crucial to prospectively enroll participants before conception, use personal air monitors to measure air pollution, and implement detailed protocols with fertility and pregnancy testing. However, such studies would unquestionably be expensive and require high compliance from couples attempting to conceive, who might be difficult to identify and recruit. Alternatively, self-match case-control study designs have received attention because of their efficiency and ability to effectively control for time-invariant confounding. The study by Tao Xue and colleagues7Xue T Zhu T Geng G Zhang Q Association between pregnancy loss and ambient PM2·5 using survey data in Africa: a longitudinal case-control study, 1998–2016.Lancet Planetary Health. 2019; 3: e219-e225Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar is the first large study to examine the association between fine particles and pregnancy loss across 33 African countries. The authors took advantage of a large multicountry sample of 42 952 women with self-reported pregnancy losses (1998–2016), who also had a successful pregnancy before or after the index loss. Monthly area-level exposures to PM2·5 and its five major constituents were estimated using satellite remote sensing technology and the chemical transport models accounting for meteorological factors. For each pregnancy loss, the monthly average concentration of PM2·5 and its constituents during various windows of pregnancy was compared with the corresponding window of a successful pregnancy within the same mother. A 10 μg/m3 increment in PM2·5 over the full gestational length was associated with an increased risk in overall pregnancy loss (adjusted OR of 1·122; 95% CI 1·107–1·137), with similar results for miscarriage (1·125; 1·109–1·142) and stillbirth (1·094; 1·051–1·138). In pollutant-specific analyses, dust particles had the strongest effects on pregnancy loss risk. A major strength of this study is that its self-match nature adjusts for factors that do not change between the pregnancies (eg, genetics).8Maclure M The case-crossover design: a method for studying transient effects on the risk of acute events.Am J Epidemiol. 1991; 133: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar However, it is important to also note that factors that can change between pregnancies, which could be years apart, could have confounded the observed association (eg, lifestyle choices, stress, comorbidities, and seasonality) in addition to changes in maternal characteristics that might vary with age such as blood pressure, body-mass index, and chronic disease risk. Xue and colleagues7Xue T Zhu T Geng G Zhang Q Association between pregnancy loss and ambient PM2·5 using survey data in Africa: a longitudinal case-control study, 1998–2016.Lancet Planetary Health. 2019; 3: e219-e225Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar estimated exposure to air pollution using satellite remote sensing technology and the chemical transport model, which produces monthly outputs at a spatial resolution of 0·1° × 0·1° across Africa. This method is subject to misclassification because it cannot account for patterns in daily activities, residential mobility, or spatiotemporal variation less than 1 month and 0·1° × 0·1°. Nevertheless, given the scope of the study and the challenges related to personal monitoring, it provides a cost-effective opportunity to explore the effects of air pollution on fetal outcomes. Since pregnancy loss was self-reported, early losses were probably missed, especially those that occur early when women might not know they are pregnant. Furthermore, the exact date of loss was not known, leading to potential misclassification of the case and control periods. The authors have done several sensitivity analyses using different methods to select the control live-birth pregnancies and tested for potential effect modifiers. The overall findings were robust and at the same exposure level, women with increased maternal age or low socioeconomic status had higher risk. Given the growing complexity of environmental threats, future studies need to investigate susceptible subgroups and pollutant interactions. In summary, although large detailed preconception cohorts are still needed to establish a causal relationship between air pollution and pregnancy loss, the work by Xue and colleagues is an interesting and pragmatic approach to investigate the effects of air pollution on pregnancy loss in low-income and middle-income countries. We declare no competing interests. Association between pregnancy loss and ambient PM2·5 using survey data in Africa: a longitudinal case-control study, 1998–2016Our findings from African DHS data showing that PM2·5 exposure is significantly associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss add to the existing epidemiological evidence from middle-income and high-income countries on the health impacts of poor air quality. Our results support public health interventions for reducing ambient particulate matter to improve maternal health in Africa. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

These consequences include slow-onset events such as desertification and sea-level rise, and so-called non-economic losses, including loss of life, degraded health, and losses induced by human mobility, loss or degradation of Indigenous territory, and reductions in biodiversity. Attention to emergency preparedness, disaster response, social supports, and issues of human displacement will be essential to address these challenges. The UN Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report shows that nations must triple the level of ambition of their first NDCs, and implement them to limit warming to 2·0°C. A fivefold increase is needed to limit warming to 1·5°C. To meet the Paris Agreement goals, all countries must move together and maximise mitigation, even in the face of costs associated with adaptation and loss and damage. Thus, for all countries to do their utmost and for developed countries to do their fair share, high-income countries have a dual obligation9Holz C Kartha S Athanasiou T Fairly sharing 1.5: national fair shares of a 1·5°C-compliant global mitigation effort.Int Environ Agreements. 2018; 18: 117-134Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar to decrease domestic emissions as fast as technologically and economically feasible, and commit to substantial international cooperation in terms of finance, technology transfer, and other elements to support mitigation in LMICs.9Holz C Kartha S Athanasiou T Fairly sharing 1.5: national fair shares of a 1·5°C-compliant global mitigation effort.Int Environ Agreements. 2018; 18: 117-134Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar Anything less means either increasing an inequitable burden on LMICs, missing the 1·5–2·0°C target, or both.9Holz C Kartha S Athanasiou T Fairly sharing 1.5: national fair shares of a 1·5°C-compliant global mitigation effort.Int Environ Agreements. 2018; 18: 117-134Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar The health sector can serve as a voice for equity worldwide and articulate to decision makers the human cost of failing to meet ambition and equity-related goals. Many no-regret mitigation interventions exist that improve health and decrease health-related costs, including coal phase-out,3Watts N Amann M Arnell N et al.The 2019 report of The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: ensuring that the health of a child born today is not defined by a changing climate.Lancet. 2019; 394: 1836-1878Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar carbon taxation,2Watts N Adger WN Agnolucci P et al.Health and climate change: policy responses to protect public health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1861-1914Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar elements of sustainable health care, and enhanced active transport infrastructure.2Watts N Adger WN Agnolucci P et al.Health and climate change: policy responses to protect public health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1861-1914Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar These factors should be included in pathways to emissions reductions, with ambitious timelines designed to result in their adoption as soon as possible. Framing climate change in terms of health has been shown to generate hopeful emotions11Myers T Nisbet M Maibach E Leiserowitz A A public health frame arouses hopeful emotions about climate change.Clim Change. 2012; 113: 1105-1112Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar and nurses and doctors are some of society's most trusted messengers. Integrating health into NDCs might be the best way to create a narrative that unifies populations around a shared desire for a healthy response to climate change. Although climate change negotiations take place in international forums, decisions related to NDCs are made nationally. Global health workers must make clear that climate change is a health emergency and that ambitious NDCs are needed to map out an adequate treatment plan. Recognising that 2020 NDC updates are under development, national health sector actors—both clinicians and advocacy bodies—must focus energy on publicly communicating the catastrophic health risks for a child born today in a world continuing along its current high-emissions pathway. They must also communicate the opportunities for enhanced wellness and cost savings for health-care systems that are inherent in meeting the Paris Agreement goals. Health professionals with experience in climate-related health emergencies can contribute a humanitarian perspective via stories of patient and health-system effects.12Devine C Guevera M Biorklund B et al.The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change. Policy brief on humanitarian impacts. Nov 2019. Lancet Countdown and Doctors Without Borders, London2019Google Scholar The health-sector must push for NDCs to be developed via an interministerial process. This push should include consultations with relevant sectors, the public, and public health, with a focus on ambition, equity, and the inclusion of policies that are mutually beneficial for health and climate. Initiatives like the NDC Partnership, which offers technical support for the development of NDCs, including from WHO, can be useful resources for governments. Between COP25 and COP26, continuous pressure must be applied by the health sector to ensure health is integrated into climate-related policy making across sectors, with a focus on creating an NDC roadmap for health. From a mitigation perspective, health economists can cost out co-benefits to health and wellbeing associated with various policy choices (eg, for a 2025 coal phase-out target vs a 2030 target) and ensure that these are incorporated into discussions. Additionally, the health costs of adaptation and the losses of life and damage to health-care systems associated with less ambitious mitigation should be factored into decision-making. Most importantly, the fact must be made clear that a healthy NDC is one that is enhanced to be in line with a nation's fair share of the global reductions necessary under the Paris Agreement to comprise both ambitious domestic emissions reduction and, in high-income countries, massive scale-ups in climate finance contributions. For example, via the Green Climate Fund or, under the right conditions, via global climate markets (article 6 of the Paris Agreement). Health organisations can also advocate for WHO, which currently has limited ability to receive funding from the Green Climate Fund, to become a full participant, in order for it be able to direct funds to health-focused programmes in LMICs. Finally, given the centrality of health to the wellbeing of a child born into today's changing climate, the global health sector should request that the presidency of COP26 make health a prominent focus of the gathering. NDCs are opportunities for nations to lay out roadmaps charting a course to a healthy, low-emissions pathway while maximising health and equity. COP25 and the interval between COP25 and COP26 are crucial time windows when the global community can influence the life trajectory of a child born today by considering health when updating NDCs in 2020. To facilitate, actors in the health sector should articulate national opportunities and risks related to different ambition scenarios and use their privileged voices to communicate those to decision makers and the public; contribute directly to the NDC review process and promote mechanisms to ensure links between ministries for years to come; and encourage public consultations in the process while bringing forth voices of their patients and those most affected. Populations will benefit from a health-centred, unifying conversation, and ministries of health and the environment should prepare for rich, ambitious dialogue.

YT and ChH declare no competing interests. A \"super-year\" for the environmentAs we enter a new year and decade, it is natural to reflect on past progress and goals for the future. It's not surprising then that 2020 is shaping up to be a critical year in establishing ambition for climate and biodiversity action. There is much optimism and anticipation that this year could be a turning point in our relationship with nature, leading to the notion of 2020 being a \"super year\" for the environment. But this will only happen through conscious effort, if we drift on as we are, it will be far from super for people or the planet. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

There is now abundant evidence that long-term climate change is affecting plant phenology, advancing the date of spring phenological events like bud-set, leaf-out, and flowering, increasing total pollen counts, and delaying autumnal phase phenological events, particularly in temporal zones.1 Although it logically follows that changes in pollen season variables would be widely detectable as the climate changes, documentation of these expected findings—solution of this particular puzzle—has been challenging, until now.",

    "ab": "Climate change is widely recognised as one of the biggest global threats of the 21st century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has projected that global warming is likely to reach 1·5°C between 2030 and 2052 if climate change continues at the current rate.1The Intergrovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeSpecial Report. Global warming of 1·5°C.https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/Date accessed: July 1, 2019Google Scholar Generally, climate change will exert adverse effects on human health. For example, many studies2Watts N Adger WN Ayeb-Karlsson S et al.The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1151-1164Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar have found that heat-related mortality would increase in parallel with climate change. However, few studies have considered the effects of adaptation, which might lead to uncertainty in risk assessments of climate change. In The Lancet Planetary Health, Hicham Achebak and colleagues3Achebak H Devolder D Ballester J Trends in temperature-related age-specific and sex-specific mortality from cardiovascular diseases in Spain: a national time-series analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e297-e306Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar did a country-wide time-series analysis in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands to assess trends in temperature-related cardiovascular disease mortality between 1980 and 2016. This is the first study to systematically investigate the health impact of the 1°C increase in annual temperature that has been observed in Spain since 1980. The authors found that the effects of warm and cold temperatures on cardiovascular disease mortality, as assessed by relative risk (RR) and attributable fraction, differed by sex and age group; the RR and attributable fraction of cardiovascular deaths due to warm and cold temperatures decreased over the 37-year time period for both sexes and all age groups. These reductions in RR and attributable fraction of temperature-related cardiovascular disease deaths might be associated with adaptive responses and more general factors, such as socioeconomic development, improved housing conditions, use of air conditioning, and health-care service development. A key message from this study was that the increased temperatures observed in Spain since 1980 occurred in parallel with substantial adaptations to both high and low temperatures. This finding highlights the importance of considering adaptation in health risk assessments of climate change.4Achebak H Devolder D Ballester J Heat-related mortality trends under recent climate warming in Spain: a 36-year observational study.PLoS Med. 2018; 15e1002617Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar Human susceptibility to high temperatures and heatwaves has substantially declined in the past five decades.5Petkova EP Gasparrini A Kinney PL Heat and mortality in New York city since the beginning of the 20th century.Epidemiology. 2014; 25: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar However, the temporal health effects of cold temperatures remain uncertain. For example, a multi-country analysis6Vicedocabrera AM Sera F Guo Y et al.A multi-country analysis on potential adaptive mechanisms to cold and heat in a changing climate.Environ Int. 2018; 111: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar showed either an increase, a decrease, or a stable trend in the effects of cold temperatures across countries. We hypothesize that if improvements in socioeconomic development and structural transformations contributed to the decline in heat-related mortality, a similar reduction in cold-related mortality would be expected. Consistent with this hypothesis, Achebak and colleagues reported that the effects of cold temperatures on mortality significantly declined between 1980 and 2016 in Spain. These findings suggest that long-term changes in cold-attributable mortality are dependent on location and the magnitude of changes in temperature. Although many studies have assessed the risk of heat-attributable mortality in the context of global warming, several studies7Gasparrini A Guo Y Hashizume M et al.Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: a multicountry observational study.Lancet. 2015; 386: 369-375Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar have reported that cold temperatures were responsible for most temperature-related deaths. Therefore, when considering the effects of adaptation in the health risk assessment of climate change, it is also necessary to comprehensively consider the effects of both warm and cold temperatures and estimate the net effects of temperature changes; this approach could directly indicate the extent to which an expected increase in heat-related mortality could be offset by the decrease in mortality due to cold temperatures and adaptation in different climate change scenarios.8Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e367Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar Global warming has gained much interest in the health risk assessments associated with climate change, but many knowledge gaps remain. For example, few novel technical approaches and frameworks exist that integrate the effects of adaptation in the risk assessment of climate change. On the basis of their present study, Achebak and colleagues could develop an approach that integrates the associations between temperature and mortality into the risk assessment of climate change, to further estimate the net effects of temperature and adaptation on mortality in Spain. Additionally, causal pathways and physiological acclimatisation might differ with exposure to warm temperatures compared with cold temperatures, and vary among regions.9Arbuthnott K Hajat S Heaviside C Vardoulakis S Changes in population susceptibility to heat and cold over time: assessing adaptation to climate change.Environ Health. 2016; 15: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar Multicentre studies are needed to identify the factors that modify the effects of temperature and temporal variation in mortality, and understand the mechanisms of temporal changes that are associated with human susceptibility to warm and cold temperatures. Although many previous studies have studied mortality as a health outcome of climate change, a 2019 study10Liu T Ren Z Zhang Y et al.Modification effects of population expansion, ageing, and adaptation on heat-related mortality risks under different climate change scenarios in Gangzhou, China.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2019; 16: 376Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar has suggested that years of life lost is the most appropriate measure to summarise the associations between temperature and mortality because it indicates the extent to which lives are shortened by exposure to non-optimum temperature ranges.10Liu T Ren Z Zhang Y et al.Modification effects of population expansion, ageing, and adaptation on heat-related mortality risks under different climate change scenarios in Gangzhou, China.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2019; 16: 376Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar Hence, the use of years of life lost is recommended for the estimation of the burden of diseases resulting from climate change. The study by Achebak and colleagues provides valuable information for policy makers and researchers for the development of strategies that enable adaption to the adverse health impacts of climate change. However, the study only included Spain. Studies that include more countries and time-series data for longer time periods are needed to further investigate the temporal trends in temperature-related mortality, especially regarding the effects of cold temperatures on mortality. We declare no competing interests. Trends in temperature-related age-specific and sex-specific mortality from cardiovascular diseases in Spain: a national time-series analysisIn Spain, the observed warming of the climate has occurred in parallel with substantial adaptation to both high and low temperatures. The reduction in the RR and the attributable fraction associated with heat would be compatible with an adaptive response specifically addressing the negative consequences of climate change. Nevertheless, the simultaneous reduction in the RR and attributable fraction of cold temperatures also highlights the importance of more general factors such as socioeconomic development, increased life expectancy and quality, and improved health-care services in the country.

    "ab": "Are the gilets jaunes protests in France an inevitable response to ambitious climate policy? With governments across the world declaring “climate emergencies”, climate policies have shot up the political agenda in many nations. Addressing the climate crisis requires governments to implement big, bold, policies to enact fundamental and rapid changes in national carbon usage but attempts so far have proved largely unpopular. This is perhaps best illustrated in France, where the “gilets jaunes”, or “yellow vests”, took to the streets to protest what they saw as the unjust increase in a fuel tax in the name of addressing climate change. Why implement policies that damage the wealth and health of the nation's poorest, they argue, when there are more polluting targets to go after? Failing to address climate change has well-established negative implications for human health. But climate policies that disproportionately affect society's poorest can also have significant negative impacts on health and wellbeing. In France, the gilets jaunes made this point felt in the strongest terms, with hundreds of thousands of citizens taking to the streets over the course of the last 7 months to protest. The marches continue, but reached their height in November and December, 2018, with three major national protests or “Acts”. As Davide Natalini, a Research Fellow at the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University explains: “If a policy like this is known to affect the poorest parts of the population most, and these are the people who spend most of their income on commodities like fuel to heat their homes, then that means they have much less to spend in taking care of themselves like buying nutritious food, and having access to good healthcare.” At first, Macron was dismissive of the protests, saying the “people complaining about rising fuel prices are the same ones who complain about pollution and how their children suffer”. The gilets jaunes were regularly referenced in the media as a symbol of what happens when governments actually try to implement policies necessary to address the climate crisis. As Natalini has previously argued, France is the “only example we know of”, that has seen riots over a government policy that raises the price of high-carbon fuels in the name of mitigating climate change. But it probably won't be the last, Natalini says, as governments have to implement sometimes harsh policies to address the climate crisis. And the protests can quickly escalate, he explains: “These protests seemed to turn into a struggle between the working class and what they call the establishment. Something that is above, that they don't feel that they control, that they feel they are neglected by and excluded by.” As the protests rolled on, the President was forced to climb down, admitting that climate policies needed to be designed in a more inclusive, more just, way. Not least because many gilets jaunes support climate action, just not at the expense of many already disenfranchised members of society. The gilets jaunes argued that there are many ways the climate crisis can be addressed in a more equitable fashion. Policymakers have spent decades trying to make these options work effectively, but so far the impact on global emissions has been limited. That also hurts societies' poorest, as Kathryn Harrison, a professor of political science and the University of British Columbia explains: “The consequences of any poorly designed policy of any sort that hurts the poor can have consequences for public health,” she says. “But the contribution of climate policy is often exaggerated. We also know that if we don't address climate change, it will be the poorest that are hurt the most.” So there's an economic, environmental, and moral imperative to get buy-in to effective climate policies, she argues. Perhaps the best-known version of a policy that goes after big polluters rather than people is emissions trading. Under such schemes, companies need permits for each tonne of carbon dioxide they emit. If they emit less than the permits they hold, they can sell the excess credits to companies that emit more; thus creating a carbon market. The EU's emissions trading scheme (ETS) was launched in 2005. But early mistakes in its design—such as giving away the permits for free at the outset, rather than auctioning them—meant it was largely ineffective. Decades of tweaks and reforms now mean it functions with a carbon price liable to make some impact on companies' activities. But the EU's biggest carbon-saving driver to date remains the financial crash of 2008, due to the impact it had on manufacturing across the continent. China is planning on implementing a national emissions trading scheme in 2020, 7 years after it established pilot schemes in seven regions. There are also some regional schemes in North America, but on the whole policy makers in the US prefer a different approach. Most recently, momentum has been gathering behind a so-called Green New Deal—a grand idea with few policy specifics thus far. But for years, there has been some support for “fee and dividend” system, largely thanks to the support of renowned NASA scientist James Hansen. Under the scheme, a fee is levied on highly polluting products such as fossil fuels, and a dividend is then paid to every citizen. The idea is that it makes high-carbon products expensive and economically unattractive, while also giving everyone some economic benefit, keeping public opinion on-side and ensuring the poorest are not unduly harmed. An influential group of Republican former Secretaries of State and business leaders are supportive of the idea. They say the plan could “strengthen our economy, reduce regulation, help working-class Americans, shrink government and promote national security”. Despite being first officially proposed in 2009, however, it remains a legislative pipe-dream in a political arena in which climate policy is proving an increasingly polarising force. A simpler option is a flat carbon tax levied on high-carbon companies, set by the government, and reviewed periodically in line with the latest science and economics. The revenue from that tax could then be spent on bolstering state-provided health care, transport infrastructure, or other policies that could help society's poorest. It could also be spent on other climate mitigation or adaptation strategies, though most economists say this shouldn't be the predetermined aim. There is, of course, one major problem with the policy: “People don't like to be taxed”, Harrison points out. Governments have tried to call it other things, “a fee, levy, price, et cetera”, she says, “but then opponents just accuse the government of trying to hide something.” In Ireland, the government is trying to implement a combination of the carbon tax and dividend plans. And in Canada, an Ontario court just ruled that the carbon tax couldn't constitutionally be considered a tax as ultimately it's not for spending, it's “giving people all the money back”, Harrison says. And that's the best way to get people to buy in to such policies, she argues: “it's not about punishment, it's about incentives”. What the gilets jaunes protests made clear to all policymakers was that whatever option they choose, it must be fair to all in society. Without it, there will remain staunch opposition and the risk of conflating climate policy with blue collar job losses. A highly visible example of this occurred at last year's annual UN climate talks, in the old coal town of Katowice in Poland. At the meeting, the Polish trade union Solidarity put out a joint statement with a number of groups known for their climate scepticism arguing that: “The negative impacts of expensive energy on human health and welfare are manifest and devastating. Affordable energy is absolutely necessary to lift people out of poverty and secure a brighter future for the people of the world.” By “affordable energy”, they meant fossil fuels. The statement showed the deep faith that some representatives of blue-collar workers retain in the fossil fuel industry's ability to deliver jobs, despite evidence that emissions are rapidly decoupling from income. There are promising signs that global policymakers are engaging with the notion that any transition away from fossil fuels must be equitable, however. At the same meeting, the concept of a “just transition”—the idea that climate policies must be coupled with measures to provide those hit by the policies with new jobs and a new future—got top billing. Thanks to the gilets jaunes, the message that the climate crisis must be addressed, but in an equitable way, is now loud and clear.",

    "ab": "BackgroundGiven rapid land use changes and climate change underway in many low-income and middle-income countries, it is vitally important to understand how ecosystem changes influence biodiversity and human health, and to identify actions that can improve conservation, while also improving human health. We are investigating how human activities alter ecological communities and influence infectious disease risk near Marojejy National Park in northeastern Madagascar. We are coupling (i) cutting-edge social science methods to investigate the drivers of human land-use decision-making, and (ii) ecological analyses to investigate how these land use decisions impact zoonotic infectious disease transmission in small mammals, domesticated animals, and humans.MethodsThe study team conducted preliminary fieldwork in one village in 2017 and 2018 including household surveys, social network surveys and trapping of small mammals to screen for parasites and pathogens. We constructed a social network of 500 people to investigate disease risk patterns based on agricultural co-working relationships. In addition, the team captured 552 small mammals and found variation in abundance and diversity across a gradient of human land use.FindingsResults show that illness is frequent within community households, with a high prevalence of fevers over the previous 3 months (40%). Non-native species have higher relative and total abundance in agricultural fields, with highest relative abundance of introduced species in the unsustainable rice farming setting. Prevalence of Leptospira, a pathogenic bacterium transmitted through urine and contaminated water, was over four times higher in paddy rice fields than in forests or hillside slash-and-burn fields.InterpretationOur findings are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in land use and biodiversity can influence animal health, which may in turn affect disease risk for humans. We are now expanding ecological and household data collection to additional villages, as well as developing choice experiments to better understand farmer decision making about sustainable agricultural practices.FundingDuke University Bass Connections programme for interdisciplinary research.",

Yet, population and family planning have been largely left out of adaptation proposals and projects. Through key informant interviews, a literature review, and research, the Population Reference Bureau identified how to promote the inclusion of family planning in climate adaptation strategies in ways that build resilience, improve health, and enhance women's economic empowerment.FindingsWays to integrate family planning into climate adaptation strategies included drawing the connections to and building the evidence base for including family planning in multisectoral adaptation approaches; reaching out to a country's designated authority to identify main climate change adaptation decision makers and develop an understanding of how adaptation finance flows; engaging in a country's National Adaptation Plan process to connect with stakeholders and identify country-driven adaptation priorities; and considering partnering with others in developing multisectoral proposals that include family planning and help to implement those proposals.InterpretationThe best opportunity for funding family planning and reproductive health within adaptation projects is to integrate women's empowerment—including family planning—within multisectoral proposals. The research includes an example of how to apply these key strategies, showing how the women's empowerment community could seize opportunities created by the importance of adapting to climate change and the growing availability of international climate financing to strengthen prospects for including women's health in climate adaptation projects. The Ecological Christian Organization of Uganda and Reproductive Health Uganda are following the Population Reference Bureau's research with a country-level strategy to advocate for the adoption of a multisectoral approach to climate adaptation in Uganda.FundingUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID).",

    "ab": "China is the largest global importer of foreign refuse waste. The categories of waste imported include electronic waste, unsorted paper, plastics, and textiles. Thousands of manual workshop-like enterprises dispose of these wastes in a crude manner (eg, from acid-stripping or open burning of electronic components and wires for metal retrieval). Sometimes, these wastes are dumped into water or directly on to soil. This practice has left the country with serious problems of air, water, and soil pollution,1Wong MH Wu SC Deng WJ et al.Export of toxic chemicals—a review of the case of uncontrolled electronic-waste recycling.Environ Pollut. 2007; 149: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar and even poor neonatal health.2Qiu SS Huo X Liu JX et al.Association between prenatal lead and cadmium exposure from electronic waste recycling and the development of neonate.Journal of Shantou University Medical College. 2012; 25: 138-140Google Scholar Large amounts of persistent toxic substances, such as dioxin-like compounds, heavy metals, and brominated flame retardants, have been released into the environment during the waste dismantling processes, which have negative effects on the environment and human health. According to several studies in China, the levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dixoxin and dibenzofurans, polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, in the environment around an electronic waste dismantling area in the studies exceeded various national and international limits. The total exposure dose to dioxins for adults, children, and breast-fed infants in China exceeded the tolerable daily intake recommended by WHO.3Chan JKY Wong MH A review of environmental fate, body burdens, and human health risk assessment of PCDD/Fs at two typical electronic waste recycling sites in China.Sci Total Environ. 2013; 463–64: 1111-1123Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar The residents had a high incidence of skin damage, headaches, vertigo, nausea, and digestive ulcers.4Qiu B, Peng L, Xu X, Lin X, Hong J, Huo X. Medical investigation of e-waste demanufacturing industry in Guiyu town. Proceedings of the International Conference on Electronic Waste and Extended Producer Responsibility; Beijing, China: April 21–22, 2004; 79–83.Google Scholar To deal with this situation, China banned the imports of foreign garbage at the end of 2017. 1 year later, it has been shown that this was the right decision as the annual import of solid waste decreased by 46·5% in 2018.5Li GJ The speech of the minister of Ecology and Environment of China (MEE China) in 2019 national work conference of ecological and environmental protection [In Chinese].http://www.mee.gov.cn/xxgk2018/xxgk/xxgk15/201901/t20190127_691113.htmlDate accessed: January 27, 2019Google Scholar This decision supported by many people in China, although some feel differently. For example, some people are worried that the rising prices of raw materials will affect paper mills, and waste exporters in developed countries are concerned about where their rubbish will go. This ban means that thousands of garbage enterprises in China would be shut down and even more workers would lose their jobs, thus damaging the local economy. That is the price China has to pay. From a global perspective and according to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, such enterprises are only the bottom link in the global chain of waste export and import disposal. What is the role and function of the waste exporter in this situation? They earn huge sums of money by selling rubbish to importers without any concern to whether these wastes are disposed of properly and legally. Sometimes, they receive substantial waste disposal allowances from their own governments, although they do not do anything except selling this waste. The largest importer country has taken responsible steps, and it is time for exporters and importers to work together to tackle the global issue of foreign refuse, and improve the level of public health. If not, this global issue will persist, and the only change will be the affected country and its residents. Yesterday it was China, tomorrow it could be another country. We declare no competing interests.",

    "ab": "The main argument by Jeffrey Howard and Alexis Santos-Lozada appears to be that because the predicted number of deaths from the displacement model in our analysis was lower than historical averages and previous counterfactual estimates for the period after Hurricane Maria, this estimate, and estimates of excess mortality associated with them therefore must be biased or inaccurate in some way. The opposite is in fact the case. It is estimates of excess mortality that ignore displacement that are biased. Mortality rates are defined as the number of deaths divided by the population at risk of dying over a particular period. Estimated deaths under the displacement scenario are less than historical ranges because massive out-migration reduced (by approximately 8%) the population at risk of dying on the island. For a constant mortality rate, a smaller number at risk will result in a smaller number of estimated deaths. All other estimates cited by Howard and Santos-Lozada, including their own, overestimate predicted (and underestimate excess) mortality in the current context simply because they do not take displacement into account. Their second critique is that we ignore selectivity associated with the risk of mortality between people who left the island and those who did not. The citation they offer in support of their assertion that “those who remain behind have characteristics associated with higher mortality risk” says nothing about mortality, though it does suggest selectivity in evacuation from New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina by race and education. Our estimates (and the census and displacement offsets) are conditioned on age, sex, socioeconomic status of municipality of residence, and interactions between them. These are major factors stratifying the risk of mortality, and probably, selectivity in migration after Maria. To the extent that both the risks of mortality and displacement are associated with these factors, this is accounted for in our estimates. Given the absence of any additional individual level information in the registration data, our multivariate analysis accounted for factors related to selective out-migration to the fullest extent possible. Lastly, the authors raise a seeming paradox. As they acknowledge, the only difference in the estimation of predicted deaths between our census and displacement models is the population at risk in each (by design, the counterfactual rates are the same). Why then, does there seem to be a higher mortality rate among the displaced in their simple tabular analysis? The answer is straightforward. They calculate mortality rates for each scenario from the size of the population at risk at the end of the period (February, 2018) and cumulative predicted deaths for the entire period (September, 2017, to February, 2018). This calculation ignores monthly variation both in displacement and mortality, which our analysis takes into account. Displacement cumulates over the period, with 46% of total person-months at risk lost over the entire period happening in December and January as seen in table 4 in our Article.1Santos-Burgoa C Sandberg J Suárez E et al.Differential and persistent risk of excess mortality from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico: a time-series analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: 478-488Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar This period is exactly when seasonal mortality in Puerto Rico peaks. In combination, this differential loss means that the displaced were disproportionately removed from the population at risk during the period of highest mortality. Considered over the entire period, their mortality rate would have been higher had they not left, simply because they left when mortality rates were highest, not because our model attributes them disproportionately higher mortality for some other reason, as Howard and Santos-Lozada seem to suggest. The goal of estimating excess mortality is to draw inferences about the number of deaths caused by an event. Though we estimated excess mortality both with and without displacement, we presented the displacement estimates to the Government of Puerto Rico as preferred because they capture deaths attributable to differences in mortality rates after the storm, accounting for the smaller population at risk due to displacement. We believe this yields a more accurate estimate of the number of deaths caused by the storm than does assuming (as in our census scenario, Howard and Santos-Lozada's own estimates, and the others they cite) that those displaced were still in Puerto Rico after the storm and at risk of mortality from the continuing hardships associated with its aftermath. We declare no competing interests. Mortality risk within counterfactual models: Puerto Rico and Hurricane MariaUsing data from the Puerto Rico Vital Statistics System obtained from the materials provided by Carlos Santos-Burgoa and colleagues,1 we compared the census-based and displacement models with death counts for Puerto Rico for the period after Hurricane Maria. We calculated confidence intervals for deaths from 2010 to 2016 for observed deaths (figure) and compared them with the pre-Hurricane and post-Hurricane counts (2017) and both counterfactual models. The displacement model falls outside of the pattern observed over the past 7 years before Hurricane Maria, while mortality between January and August does not (figure). Full-Text PDF Open AccessDifferential and persistent risk of excess mortality from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico: a time-series analysisAnalysis of all-cause mortality with vital registration data allows for unbiased estimation of the impact of disasters associated with natural hazards and is useful for public health surveillance. It does not depend on certified cause of death, the basis for the official death toll in Puerto Rico. Although all sectors of Puerto Rican society were affected, recovery varied by municipal socioeconomic development and age groups. This finding calls for equitable disaster preparedness and response to protect vulnerable populations in disasters. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

As the authors aptly describe, human and veterinary medicine share common issues and challenges, such as zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance. An interdisciplinary approach might be effective in overcoming the challenges common to both human and animal health. However, despite the attempts of various organisations and governments to foster interdisciplinary collaboration, there is still little cooperation between the two disciplines. The American Medical Association and American Veterinary Medical Association endorsed the concept of One Health in 2008,2King LJ Anderson LR Blackmore CG et al.Executive summary of the AVMA One Health Initiative Task Force report.J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2008; 233: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar and pledged to improve communication between the two professions. A decade on and still little progress has been made. We propose that new strategies are required for the One Health initiative to gain traction. We suggest that one such strategy to improve communication between human and veterinary medicine is to begin with students. Introducing interdisciplinary group projects into the curricula of medical and veterinary schools would foster teamwork and early networking between veterinary and medical students. Similar projects are already being implemented in the USA. The Zoobiquity Research Initiative pairs veterinary students from the University of California Davis with medical students from the University of California Los Angeles to work collaboratively on projects affecting animal and human health.3Horowitz BN Bowers K Zoobiquity: what animals can teach us about being human. Random House, New York2012Google Scholar Encouragingly, Edwards and colleagues4Edwards JC Walsum Kv Sanders CW et al.Attitudes of veterinary medical students and medical students toward collaborative learning: an experiment.J Vet Med Educ. 2004; 31: 77-79Crossref Google Scholar reported that medical student attitudes towards collaborative learning were more positive after an interdisciplinary surgical skills session with veterinary students. Further studies trialing collaborative learning would provide insight into the feasibility and potential benefits of such a programme. Projects exploring the similarities and differences between the pathogenesis and treatment of common diseases affecting both animals and humans, such as cancer or heart disease, would help medical and veterinary students appreciate the clinical challenges shared by both fields. These learning exercises would provide medical and veterinary students with the opportunity to consider how a collaborative approach might benefit their future patients. Although we acknowledge that this strategy might be logistically challenging, it would certainly be possible in institutions with both a medical and veterinary medicine faculty. The current lack of collaboration between doctors and veterinarians represents a missed opportunity to benefit from interdisciplinary research and clinical practice. To seize this missed opportunity, we propose that medical and veterinary schools should consider incorporating the One Health Initiative into their curricula. We declare no competing interests. Collaboration between human and veterinary medicine as a tool to solve public health problemsThe implementation of an effective collaboration between human and veterinary medicine, environmental protection, and public health is not a fully achieved goal, although several examples of integrated approaches have been documented in Europe. The concept of one world, one health has recently appeared, indicating that the world has suddenly woken up to the link between animal diseases, public health, and the environment. The need for collaboration between the human, animal, and environmental health sectors is due to the increase in emerging human infectious diseases with a zoonotic origin and in the resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobial drugs.

For example, media coverage by television, radio, and newspapers has long been dominated by the medical model of health2Community Development and Health NetworkModels of Health. Community Development and Health Network.https://www.cdhn.org/sites/default/files/downloads/FACTSHEETS%201_Screen%20View%281%29.pdfDate accessed: July 4, 2019Google Scholar and its general advice on heat avoidance. This advice typically includes restricting physical activity, wearing loose and light-coloured clothing, drinking more water, cooling the body, and protecting against sunburn.3Hajat S O'Connor M Kosatsky T Health effects of hot weather: from awareness of risk factors to effective health protection.Lancet. 2010; 375: 856-863Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar This model of advice has been sustained during the recent and unprecedented heatwave across mainland Europe this summer. But this common sense and passive mode of communication is problematic because it places undue emphasis on individual physiological characteristics, such as genetics and health status, and individual behaviours, such as physical activity and drinking. It is not targeted at high-risk or the most vulnerable people—such as older people, the chronically ill, children, those who are socially isolated, and outdoor workers. Media institutions should instead adopt a broader, social model of health,2Community Development and Health NetworkModels of Health. Community Development and Health Network.https://www.cdhn.org/sites/default/files/downloads/FACTSHEETS%201_Screen%20View%281%29.pdfDate accessed: July 4, 2019Google Scholar which accounts for the wider determinants of health, including social, economic, and environmental factors (eg, income, housing quality, social networks, and healthy workplaces). Wider support actions should also be considered—eg, going to cool public places, such as libraries and community centres; promoting checks on vulnerable individuals; and providing information via heat-health telephone helplines. The power of the media in communicating risk and facilitating action should not be underestimated. Shifting the focus away from the medical model of health and towards a social model would more effectively recast the problem as one that is fundamentally about public health and not individual behaviours. I declare no competing interests. Record breakersThe last 22 years contain 20 of the warmest (global average) years on record. This trend is powerfully demonstrated by the popular #Showyourstripes initiative. That most of the warmest years have occurred very recently is hardly surprising given that our planet is being heated by increasing amounts of heat trapping CO2 in the atmosphere—primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels. In this context 2019, which has seen a number of record-breaking heatwaves, is displaying exactly the sorts of conditions that we should expect to see more and more often. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "As of July, 2019, more than 100 countries have not totally banned the mining, importing, exporting, trading, and use of asbestos.1International Ban Asbestos SecretariatCurrent asbestos bans.http://ibasecretariat.org/alpha_ban_list.phpDate: July 15, 2019Date accessed: August 9, 2019Google Scholar In these countries—including current major producers or users of asbestos such as Russia, Kazakhstan, China, India, and Indonesia—asbestos-related diseases will persist for decades longer than in other countries that have implemented an asbestos ban. Indeed, countries that banned asbestos a quarter of a century ago are still contributing substantially to the worldwide toll of more than 100 000 asbestos-related deaths per year. No ban has ever been promulgated in the USA,2Lemen RA Landrigan P Toward an asbestos ban in the United States.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2017; 141302Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar where the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard in the workplace—ie, a concentration of 0·1 fibre per mL air—approximates the lowest detectable level with current measuring methods. In The Lancet Planetary Health, Ro-Ting Lin and colleagues report findings of a global comparison showing that, for any country, the odds of adopting a ban on asbestos are associated with both the level of government efficiency and ratification of two international Conventions regarding asbestos control in the workplace and in international trade—the UN's Basel Convention and the International Labor Organization's C162 Asbestos Convention.3Lin R-T Chien L-C Jimba M Furuya S Takahashi K Implementation of national policies for a total asbestos ban: a global comparison.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: 341-348Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar In a previous study, Bahk and colleagues suggested that the process of banning asbestos was conditioned by cognition of the burden of asbestos-caused diseases and experience in tackling social problems through adequate facilities.4Bahk J Choi Y Lim S Paek D Why some, but not all, countries have banned asbestos.Int J Occup Environ Health. 2013; 19: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar To understand how stakeholders have shaped their attitude to asbestos during the years-long process leading to bans on asbestos, we should remember that the abandonment of asbestos has been preceeded by many notable events. First was the beginning of the environmentalist movement after publication, in 1962, of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring. Second was the assessment, in 1977, by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) that all forms of asbestos are carcinogenic to man.5WHOIARCIARC Monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risk to humans: vol 14—asbestos. International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon1977Google Scholar Third was growing awareness around 1980 by industry, trade unions, and governments that safer substitutes for asbestos exist. Fourth, using data from cancer registries and mortality statistics, researchers began to produce estimates of the number of cancer cases attributable to asbestos.6Doll R Peto R The causes of cancer: quantitative estimates of avoidable risks of cancer in the United States today.J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981; 66: 1191-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (3922) Google Scholar Fifth was increased awareness (expanding from the scientific milieu to people with asbestos-related illnesses and the general public) that mesotheliomas might be caused by relatively low exposure to asbestos outside the workplace (deplorably, cancer deaths from exposure in the general environment cause more emotion than occupational cancers). Sixth was creation in the 1980s and 1990s of ad-hoc advocacy groups (eg, BastAmianto in Italy) indicating that asbestos bans would be the only solution to health problems. Such groups included scientists and public health workers, medical associations, and other professional bodies. Finally, beginning in the 1970s, in the USA in particular, workers started suing manufacturers and suppliers of asbestos fibres they had handled. This action meant giant companies faced liabilities exceeding their worth and insurance combined.7Castleman BI Asbestos: medical and legal aspects.5th edn. Wolters Kluwer, Law and Business, New York2011Google Scholar As a result, from the 1980s in Europe and the USA, the market for asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) stopped being financially convenient. Unravelling how these many and varied factors—and others not noted here—have combined in different countries and periods is a challenge for health historians and economists. Banning asbestos is important, but it simply means stopping extraction, processing, importing, and trading asbestos or ACMs. In itself, a ban does not create an asbestos-free country. Rendering the ACMs present at the time of the ban harmless, more than 30 million tons in the case of Italy,8Ministero della SaluteQuaderno del Ministero della Salute no 15: stato dell'arte e prospettive in materia di contrasto alle patologie asbesto-correlate—maggio-giugno 2012. Ministero della Salute, Rome2012Google Scholar is a major challenge for politicians, environmental and public health services, and consultant scientists. It requires planning, prioritising, monitoring, and allocation of funds and should be characterised by transparency in releasing information to the public. Indeed, in many countries, decades after the ban, a number of questions remain open. For example, how many ACMs remain to be remediated? Have all schools and other public buildings been made asbestos-free? Where are ACMs finally disposed? And, has asbestos been eliminated from pipes and ovens in industry. Furthermore, banning asbestos does not imply any less attention for medical treatment, in view of the very long latency of asbestos-induced illness. On the contrary, efforts should be implemented to identify and compensate all patients with asbestos-related cancer, ensuring that they are attended in the most appropriate hospital units. Availability of adequate health surveillance for workers previously exposed to asbestos is also important. Public health authorities might also face difficulties in distinguishing between reliable versus unreliable scientific results. Indeed, many reports defending asbestos, which are intended to influence policy decisions on asbestos hazards, have been published.9Terracini B Mirabelli D Asbestos and product defence science.Int J Epidemiol. 2016; 45: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 10Michaels D Doubt is their product. How industry's assault on science threatens your health. Oxford University Press, Oxford2008Google Scholar A few of these product defence reports have been followed by complaints to the publishing journal, with few followed by late declarations of competing interests or an erratum. In a quarter of reports reviewed in a survey of scientific reports on either extent or outcomes of exposure to asbestos, a statement regarding competing interests was missing.11Valenzuela M Giraldo M Gallo-Murcia S Pineda J Santos L Ramos-Bonilla JP Recent scientific evidence regarding asbestos use and health consequences of asbestos exposure.Curr Environ Health Rep. 2016; 3: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar Authors declared no competing interests in 92 of 134 reports providing evidence of risk (positive reports) and in one of 11 that did not (negative reports). Such a mismatch between positive and negative studies has also occurred among epidemiological investigations of passive smoking, of side-effects of new drugs, and of other aspects of environmental cancer.12Barnes DE Bero LA Why review articles on the health effects of passive smoking reach different conclusions.JAMA. 1998; 279: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar The scientific community and journals ought to become more thorough in detecting misquotations and implementing a coherent and strict policy on declarations of competing interests as well as sanctioning the absence of such a declaration. In any country, the social, cultural, and political factors shaping the debate and contributing to decisions on banning asbestos are complex and nuanced. At the scientific level, specious pro-abestos arguments disguised as science or scientific doubt should be identified and rejected. BT has served as an expert witness for the Public Prosecution Office and for the Court in asbestos trials. Implementation of national policies for a total asbestos ban: a global comparisonThis study confirms that adoption of both the C162 Asbestos Convention and the Basel Convention facilitates countries in moving towards a total asbestos ban. The effect was reinforced by government effectiveness. Both international programmes and new agreements towards total asbestos bans and government commitments are needed. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "Plastics are designed to be durable and the ubiquitous and wasteful way they are typically utilised, along with poor waste management practices, is leading to an abundance of plastics in the environment. Large pieces of plastic are an eyesore and represent physical risks to wildlife but as plastics break down into small pieces, microplastics, they are more readily transported and more easily inhaled or ingested. Microplastics have been found very widely spread but the relative role of different transport mechanisms remains unclear. To investigate the role of atmospheric transport in microsplastic distribution into the arctic Melanie Bergmann at the Alfred-Wegener-Institute, Germany, and co-authors analysed snow samples from ice floes from the Fram Strait, near Greenland and, compared them with snow samples from remote (Alpine) and populated (Bremen) sites. They find substantial, but highly variable, concentrations of microplastic particles in Arctic snow. Concentrations were significantly lower than in European snow but higher than expected for such a remote northerly location such that atmospheric transport and deposition seem likely to be important mechanisms for microplastic transport. Research aiming to address complex sustainability challenges often apply “new” modes of research such as post-normal science or transdisciplinarity in order to enhance the practical utility of the knowledge created by incorporating relevant scientific disciplines and non-academic stakeholders. Jens Newig from Leuphana University, Germany and co-authors undertook a comparative analysis of 81 sustainability-oriented research projects, with in-depth analysis of six of these, to investigate the connections between research modes and societal and academic project outcomes. Results are complex but they find a general pattern that early involvement of non-academic partners does tend to enhance the practical societal outcome of research. However, there is often a cost in terms of academic measures of performance such as citations. Encouragingly though this trade-off is not inevitable and well-designed projects with clearly defined disciplinary as well as transdisciplinary phases are able to perform well by both measures. In the face of multiple global social and environmental changes resilience has become an international policy priority. Demonstrating that investments in resilience building are effective and going to the right people and places requires resilience measurement. Approaches tend to be objectively-oriented – using external definitions of resilience measured through observation or external verification, or subjectively oriented – based on people's own judgements of what resilience means to them, and self-evaluation of their own resilience. Lindsey Jones at the Grantham Research Institute, UK, and co-authors investigate if these different approaches yield similar results in northern Uganda. They find that the approaches share similar associations with key socio-economic drivers of resilience but sometimes differ markedly in terms of the contributions of important traits such as coping strategies, education and prior experience. The authors argue that there is a need for resilience evaluators to consider a diversity of knowledge sources and seek greater use of evidence in selecting resilience indicators. Images can be highly influential in shaping peoples' attitudes and preferences, but the role of media imagery in bringing sustainability challenges into everyday cultures and practices is largely neglected. To address this gap Saffron O'Neill, from the University of Exeter, examined over a thousand images associated with articles about climate change in UK and US newspapers between 2001 and 2009, a key period for public climate change engagement. She found a closely consistent visual discourse in UK and US newspapers which changed around 2005. Early framing tended to use distant imagery such as polar landscapes. After 2005, with the rise in climate scepticism, there was a rapid increase in visual coverage, and an increase in use of the contested visual frames with an increase in climate cartoons and protest imagery. Understanding visual use and its influence on peoples' engagement with issues is a vital component of an evidence-based approach to climate and sustainability engagement.",

    "ab": "BackgroundThe Pacific Least Developed Countries (LDCs)—Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu—are among the countries most vulnerable to climate variability and change. Key climate change risks include loss of livelihoods, coastal settlements, infrastructure, ecosystem services, and economic stability; and interaction of sea level rise with high-water-level events, threatening low-lying coastal areas. These risks result in increased health impacts, including deaths and injuries from extreme events (eg, heatwaves, storms, and floods); increased risks of infectious diseases (including food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne); food insecurity and malnutrition; and diffuse impacts from loss of livelihoods and migration. The young, older adults, women of reproductive age, and people with disabilities are most vulnerable.MethodsBuilding resilience to climate change requires that these countries develop National Climate Change and Health Action Plans, including Vulnerability and Adaptation assessments.FindingsTemperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events can influence the incidence, geographic distribution, and seasonality of climate-sensitive health outcomes. In addition, many hospitals and community health centres are highly vulnerable to cyclones, floods, storm surges, sea level rise, and disturbances in water supply caused by drought or salination of aquifers. The capacity to provide health services, particularly in emergency situations, is substantially affected if buildings and essential supplies and amenities are damaged. The majority of health facilities are not resilient to climate-induced pressures in terms of structural, non-structural, and functional safety.InterpretationThe most effective measures to reduce vulnerability are (i) short-term programmes that implement and improve basic public health measures, including the provision of safe water and improved sanitation, secure essential health care, and increase capacity for disaster preparedness and response; and (ii) longer-term programs that enhance national health systems and institutions with climate change-related risks integrated into health governance, strengthen health information management systems, and ensure effective and accessible delivery of health services.FundingLeast Developed Countries Fund under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",

    "ab": "BackgroundTransitioning from current to sustainable diets that have low environmental impacts and high nutrition and are culturally acceptable can contribute greatly towards the achievement of several national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With a population of 1·3 billion, widely prevalent malnutrition and increasing incomes, India's per capita consumption patterns will also play a key role over next decade in deciding the fate of United Nations 2030 global SDGs.MethodsHere we assess how the intake amounts of different food items in Indian diets must change in order to the meet the daily-recommended levels for 29 macro and micro nutrients while maintaining environmental footprints below the five food-related per capita planetary boundaries (carbon emissions, water, land, nitrogen and phosphorus use). We also put several cultural acceptability constraints to avoid obtaining an unrealistic diet.FindingsA considerable departure from current dietary behaviour is needed to transition from current to sustainable diets in India. While the daily per capita environmental footprints of current Indian diets are well below the respective planetary boundaries, the daily recommended levels for vitamins B12, E, and K, fibre, potassium, and choline are not being met currently, suggesting the need to pay special attention to them. The required changes include high increases (>200 g per capita per day) in fruits and vegetable intake, moderate increases in the intake of other grains (eg, millet, sorghum, rye), pulses, roots and tubers, fish and meat (about 30 g each) and a high reduction in intake of rice and dairy products (>100 g each).InterpretationFuture research should assess the potential of different leverage points from both the production side (eg, reducing food loss, filling yield gaps, improving technologies, biofortification) and the consumption side (eg, taxes, subsidies, campaigns, changes in physical microenvironment) to help transition towards sustainable diets.FundingInitiation Grant of IIT Kanpur, India (number 2018386).",

    "ab": "The Planetary Health Alliance is a consortium of over 130 dedicated universities, non-government organisations, government entities, and research institutes from around the world committed to advancing planetary health—an interdisciplinary field focused on understanding and quantifying the effects of accelerating environmental change on human health. The Planetary Health Alliance and Stanford University are organizing the third Annual Meeting on Planetary Health on Sept 4–6, 2019, at Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA, USA). As in past years, we are seeking abstracts for oral and poster presentations. In conjunction with the meeting, The Lancet Planetary Health will publish a booklet of selected outstanding abstracts. This year, there will be three categories for abstract submission: Scientific Research, Education, and Policy & Practice. Researchers, educators, policymakers and practitioners from any discipline relevant to planetary health are invited to submit an abstract of their work describing a recent study or current project that contributes to gaps in knowledge, governance, and imagination as reported by the Rockefeller–Lancet Commission on Planetary Health.1Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar Topics of interest include geographically diverse examples of approaches, methods, tools, and indicators to assess how, where, and why environmental change leads to meaningful public health impacts and to address solutions to planetary health challenges. If you have any questions about whether a topic is relevant, please visit the Planetary Health Alliance website for themes or e-mail [email protected] Submissions are due by 1700h EST (2200 h GMT) on April 1, 2019, and should be submitted online. Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to present as oral or poster presenters at the 2019 Planetary Health Annual Meeting. Notifications of acceptance will be sent by 1700 h EST on April 30, 2019. Abstracts should be in English, 300 words maximum, and present detailed information on study or project design, methods, and results, even if preliminary. Attention should be given to describing the impact of a change in the structure or function of a natural system(s) on a dimension (or dimensions) of human health. Abstracts in the Education and Policy & Practice categories should include project objectives and parameters, audience or stakeholders engaged, and experience to date. Please lay out your abstract under the following headings: title (including a study descriptor if appropriate—eg, randomised), background (including context and aim), methods, findings, interpretation. Include names, titles, highest degrees, and affiliations of all authors; postal and email addresses for the corresponding author; any funding received (if none, state this); and a brief summary of the contributions of each author and any competing interests. Do not include references, tables, or figures. We declare no competing interests.",

An example is the cooperation, established in 2010, between Pyongyang Medical College, Kim Il Sung University in North Korea and the University of Oslo in Norway. In an effort to become a leading university, Pyongyang Medical College acknowledges that it needs to contribute to the international scientific literature, which is scarce at present. The University of Oslo aims to assist Pyongyang Medical College to build capacity in international scientific writing, and a bilateral exchange of staff and students. The University of Oslo is offering seats at their international summer school to staff of Pyongyang Medical College to build competence in international community health, which might further strengthen the collaboration between Norway and North Korea, and ultimately improve population health. Kim Il Sung University is interested in establishing international cooperation in public health, clinical medicine, and basic medical science. Provision of e-learning resources and medical journals sent on a regular basis by mail and subscriptions from international universities and research journals are welcomed. Medical training programmes in both North Korea and abroad that include international partnerships might help to advance population health and wellbeing in North Korea and, in the end, all people globally.

The first known natural infection of a human by a simian malaria was documented in 1965, when a surveyor for the US Army Map Service, working deep in the jungles of peninsular Malaysia, was infected by P knowlesi.2Chin W Contacos PG Coatney GR Kimball HR A naturally acquired quotidian-type malaria in man transferable to monkeys.Science. 1965; 149: 865-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar Previous experimental P knowlesi infections in humans had revealed the daily fever pattern of this parasite and tests had also shown that rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) infected with P knowlesi developed severe disease and often died. This first known zoonotic infection was confirmed to be P knowlesi by experimental inoculation—by use of blood from the infected person—of seven other individuals (who subsequently developed daily fevers) and three rhesus macaques, all of which subsequently died. The possibility of zoonotic malaria had major implications for ongoing malaria elimination and eradication efforts and sparked a massive research project in the jungles where the zoonosis had likely occurred (central Pahang).3Warren M Cheong WH Fredericks HK Coatney GR Cycles of jungle malaria in west Malaysia.Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1970; 19: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar Blood was collected from 1117 participants living in the area and M mulatta monkeys were subsequently inoculated. None showed signs of illness. Although it was apparent that P knowlesi could infect humans, the findings from this investigation led many to believe that this only occurred in rare circumstances.3Warren M Cheong WH Fredericks HK Coatney GR Cycles of jungle malaria in west Malaysia.Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1970; 19: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar More than 30 years later, investigations into an abnormally high burden of Plasmodium malariae uncovered a large focus of misdiagnosed P knowlesi infections in Malaysian Borneo.4Singh B Sung LK Matusop A et al.A large focus of naturally acquired Plasmodium knowlesi infections in human beings.Lancet. 2004; 363: 1017-1024Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar Since then, human P knowlesi infections have been identified in most other nations in southeast Asia, although the heaviest apparent burden continues to exist in northern Borneo.5Singh B Daneshvar C Human infections and detection of Plasmodium knowlesi.Clin Microbiol Rev. 2013; 26: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar Most cases have been detected through passive case detection, leaving questions about the true burden of the disease in endemic areas. An impressive cross-sectional study by Kimberley Fornace and colleagues,6Fornace KM Brock PM Abidin TR et al.Environmental risk factors and exposure to the zoonotic malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi across northern Sabah, Malaysia: a population-based cross-sectional survey.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e157-e158Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar in The Lancet Planetary Health, provides the first detailed description of the overall burden of P knowlesi across a wide geographical region that is endemic for the disease (four districts in northern Sabah of Malaysian Borneo). Approximately 5% of the total surveyed population was seropositive for P knowlesi. Predictors of exposure included male sex, older age groups, reported contact with macaques, and reported activities in forested areas. Environmental attributes that were positively associated with P knowlesi exposure included living near irrigated rice paddy fields and pulpwood plantations, and near fragmented oil palm plantations. Participants living near fragmented forests and at higher geographical elevations were less likely to be seropositive for P knowlesi. Contact patterns between humans, mosquito vectors, and macaques are influenced by movement and land use patterns across heterogeneous environments. The movement ranges of human, macaque, and mosquito populations are likely to span different spatial scales. The most appropriate spatial scale for predicting risk of exposure to P knowlesi is therefore unclear. Rather than choosing arbitrary spatial units for use in their model, Fornace and colleagues measured environmental variables at radii ranging from 100 m to 5000 m around participant households and used a data mining approach to choose a best fitting model. This approach could usefully be implemented with many other datasets and with different disease systems. Some key questions remain unanswered. Although it is clear that humans can acquire this infection from macaques, human-to-human transfer in nature has not been established. Further basic science and ecological research into this disease system is warranted. P knowlesi infections appear to be relatively rare and heterogeneously distributed, but it is possible that low-density infections are missed. Methods that are designed to detect low-density infections7Imwong M Hanchana S Malleret B et al.High-throughput ultrasensitive molecular techniques for quantifying low-density malaria parasitemias.J Clin Microbiol. 2014; 52: 3303-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar might be informative for understanding the epidemiology of P knowlesi. Serological markers can be useful for measuring historical disease burdens, and are perhaps especially useful in situations where infections are rare. Serological work on P knowlesi is promising, but continued work on the longevity and seroreactivity of antigenic responses to the parasite are needed. In this study, the authors attempted to measure only recent exposure. However, it is not immediately clear why exposure would increase (almost linearly) with age. This might be the result of behavioural differences across age groups, repeated exposure across the lifespan, or a combination of both factors. Although globally rare, P knowlesi malaria will probably continue to have public health significance at least for northern Borneo, where it is the largest overall contributor to malaria8WHO Regional Office for Western PacificExpert consultation on Plasmodium knowlesi malaria to guide malaria elimination strategies, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, 1–2 March 2017: meeting report.

This zoonotic malaria, which exists at extremely high prevalence in some macaque populations,10Lee K-S Divis PCS Zakaria SK et al.Plasmodium knowlesi: reservoir hosts and tracking the emergence in humans and macaques.PLoS Pathogens. 2011; 7: e1002015Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar poses unique challenges that will need to be addressed if all forms of malaria are to be eliminated.

We calculated confidence intervals for deaths from 2010 to 2016 for observed deaths (figure) and compared them with the pre-Hurricane and post-Hurricane counts (2017) and both counterfactual models. The displacement model falls outside of the pattern observed over the past 7 years before Hurricane Maria, while mortality between January and August does not (figure). A comparison of the upper limits of the historical 95% and 99% CIs produced estimates of excess deaths of 1061 and 985, which are consistent with the census-based model1Santos-Burgoa C Sandberg J Suárez E et al.Differential and persistent risk of excess mortality from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico: a time-series analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: 478-488Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar and previous estimates.2Santos-Lozada AR Howard JT Use of death counts from vital statistics to calculate excess deaths in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.J Am Med Assoc. 2018; 320: 1491-1493Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar Even though the predicted number of deaths in the displacement model was less than the historical ranges, it was the only estimate provided to the Government of Puerto Rico.3Andrade E Barrett N Colon-Ramos U et al.Ascertainment of the estimated excess mortality from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. August 28, 2018. Milken Institute School of Public Health, Washington, DC2018https://prstudy.publichealth.gwu.edu/Date accessed: April 16, 2019Google Scholar If death counts before Hurricane Maria fell within historical ranges, why is this outcome not the case for the counterfactual model? A counterfactual model is supposed to represent what would have been expected if an event did not occur, so why would the preferred counterfactual model include additional hurricane-induced population displacement? In addition, the only way this model would occur is by assuming higher mortality risk for those who were displaced than for those who stayed behind. This assumption ignores the selectivity mechanisms that operate after climate disasters regarding population mobility. Previous research, albeit in other contexts, has found that those who remain behind have characteristics associated with higher mortality risk.4Thiede BC Brown DL Hurricane Katrina: Who stayed and why?.Popul Res Policy Rev. 2013; 32: 804-824Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar The displacement model overstates the mortality risk for those who were displaced with a mortality rate ratio of 158 in comparison with the census-based model or 165 compared with the displacement model.5Santos-Lozada AR Howard JT Supplement to: ascertaining mortality risk within counterfactual models: Puerto Rico and Hurricane Maria. GitHub.https://alexisrsantos.github.io/Correspondence_Lancet/Date: 2018Date accessed: April 10, 2019Google Scholar Assuming a higher mortality risk for displaced individuals seems to contradict other findings within the Article,1Santos-Burgoa C Sandberg J Suárez E et al.Differential and persistent risk of excess mortality from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico: a time-series analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: 478-488Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar which shows a higher risk for individuals of an older age and lower socioeconomic status—ie, those who are less likely to migrate.4Thiede BC Brown DL Hurricane Katrina: Who stayed and why?.Popul Res Policy Rev. 2013; 32: 804-824Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar Estimates produced after Hurricane Maria have gravitated around 1000 excess deaths.

Excess death estimates comparing the observed deaths between September, 2017, and February, 2018, and the upper limit of the historical confidence intervals, are within the margins of the census-based model1Santos-Burgoa C Sandberg J Suárez E et al.Differential and persistent risk of excess mortality from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico: a time-series analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: 478-488Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar and previous estimates.2Santos-Lozada AR Howard JT Use of death counts from vital statistics to calculate excess deaths in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.J Am Med Assoc. 2018; 320: 1491-1493Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar The census model captured all the previous estimates, produced before the publication of the Article, within its 95% CI.5Santos-Lozada AR Howard JT Supplement to: ascertaining mortality risk within counterfactual models: Puerto Rico and Hurricane Maria.

August 28, 2018. Milken Institute School of Public Health, Washington, DC2018https://prstudy.publichealth.gwu.edu/Date accessed: April 16, 2019Google Scholar We declare no competing interests. Mortality risk within counterfactual models: Puerto Rico and Hurricane Maria – Authors' replyThe main argument by Jeffrey Howard and Alexis Santos-Lozada appears to be that because the predicted number of deaths from the displacement model in our analysis was lower than historical averages and previous counterfactual estimates for the period after Hurricane Maria, this estimate, and estimates of excess mortality associated with them therefore must be biased or inaccurate in some way. The opposite is in fact the case. It is estimates of excess mortality that ignore displacement that are biased. Full-Text PDF Open AccessDifferential and persistent risk of excess mortality from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico: a time-series analysisAnalysis of all-cause mortality with vital registration data allows for unbiased estimation of the impact of disasters associated with natural hazards and is useful for public health surveillance. It does not depend on certified cause of death, the basis for the official death toll in Puerto Rico. Although all sectors of Puerto Rican society were affected, recovery varied by municipal socioeconomic development and age groups. This finding calls for equitable disaster preparedness and response to protect vulnerable populations in disasters. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

Exposure to green spaces has been associated with numerous health benefits for children's and adolescents' mental health,2Vanaken GJ Danckaerts M Impact of green space exposure on children's and adolescents' mental health: a systematic review.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2018; 15: E2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar including positive stress reduction.3Hunter MR Gillespie BW Chen SY-P Urban nature experiences reduce stress in the context of daily life based on salivary biomarkers.Front Psychol. 2019; 10: 722Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar However, Donovan and colleagues' study is the first to extensively explore the role of the environment in the development of a chronic mental health condition that poses a substantial financial burden in terms of individual and societal costs. Donovan and colleagues1Donovan GH Michael YL Gatziolis D 't Mannetje A Douwes J Association between exposure to the natural environment, rurality, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children in New Zealand: a linkage study.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e226-e234Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar identified all children (n=57 450) born in New Zealand in 1998, of which 49 923 were included in the study sample (after exclusion of those with no address or those who had left the country). The researchers assessed those children's exposures to green spaces yearly from gestation to 18 years of age on the basis of the rurality and greenness (normalised difference vegetation index [NDVI], calculated from satellite imagery) of their residential location. ADHD diagnoses were defined as hospital diagnosis or at least two recorded prescriptions for ADHD drugs. The results showed that living in a rural area between 2 years and 18 years of age had a protective effect against the development of symptoms associated with ADHD (odds ratio [OR] 0·670 [95% CI 0·461–0·974]), as did increased minimum yearly greenness exposure for the same period (standardised OR 0·841 [0·707–0·999] for second quartile vs first quartile of minimum NDVI exposure). Rurality or greenness exposure before 2 years of age did not affect the development of ADHD symptoms. The observed protective effect was evident even after controlling for known risk factors such as sex, ethnicity, maternal education, and maternal smoking. The authors speculated that green spaces probably exert their effect by moderating the expression of the symptoms of ADHD, rather than by preventing their initial development. This study is the most comprehensive cohort study to date to investigate this relationship. In addition to the large and mostly intact sample, the use of technology to assess greenness (ie, calculating NDVI from satellite imagery) and to link those data with a child's residential location throughout life, and thus with ADHD diagnoses, is a strength of the paper. Mental disorders constitute a considerable burden for modern communities, and evidence indicates that, despite access to evidence-based treatments, this burden is likely to escalate further.4Mulder R Rucklidge J Wilkinson S Why has increased provision of psychiatric treatment not reduced the prevalence of mental disorder?.Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2017; 51: 1176-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Jorm AF Patten SB Brugha TS Mojtabai R Has increased provision of treatment reduced the prevalence of common mental disorders?

Donovan and colleagues' study1Donovan GH Michael YL Gatziolis D 't Mannetje A Douwes J Association between exposure to the natural environment, rurality, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children in New Zealand: a linkage study.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e226-e234Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar highlights one controllable environmental variable that could easily be modified in modern home designs and through providing education on the important health benefits for children of spending time in natural environments. Their findings also fit comfortably within the context of a growing body of research showing the detrimental effects of other modifiable environmental factors on the expression of ADHD, such as poor nutrition7Taylor MR Chuang C Carrasco KD Nagatomo S Rucklidge JJ Dietary and micronutrient treatments for children with neurodevelopment disorders.Curr Dev Disord Rep. 2018; 5: 243-252Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar and early-life exposure to persistent organic pollutants.8Lenters V Iszatt N Forns J et al.Early-life exposure to persistent organic pollutants (OCPs, PBDEs, PCBs, PFASs) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a multi-pollutant analysis of a Norwegian birth cohort.Environ Int. 2019; 125: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar Although other risk factors have been identified for the development of ADHD that are difficult to change, such as genetics,9Faraone SV Larsson H Genetics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Mol Psychiatry. 2019; 24: 562-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar Donovan and colleagues' study underscores that a focus on modification of the environment is essential to reduce the burden of mental illness. The link between the rural environment and microbial exposure, as postulated in the study, is intriguing. Some preliminary evidence suggests that microbial diversity might affect the expression of ADHD symptoms.10Prehn-Kristensen A Zimmermann A Tittmann L et al.Reduced microbiome alpha diversity in young patients with ADHD.PLoS One. 2018; 13: e0200728Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar We do not yet know whether manipulation of this diversity can improve the symptoms of ADHD; however, Donovan and colleagues' study suggests that greater exposure to green spaces might promote such changes. The opportunities for both prevention and intervention are obvious, but might require government policy to be adequately targeted. Some assumptions made in conducting the study are limitations to the findings. Children living in rural areas might be less likely to seek an ADHD diagnosis or to be able to access specialised professionals. Furthermore, a child's home environment does not constitute the entire living environment, and we cannot assume that reduced access to green space is associated with less time spent outside. Donovan and colleagues' study shows that linking satellite data with a mental health diagnosis is achievable, and the authors discovery of this novel way of exposing a modifiable risk factor for ADHD is commendable. As the technology becomes more sophisticated, so will the certainty in the findings. I declare no competing interests. Association between exposure to the natural environment, rurality, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children in New Zealand: a linkage studyRurality and increased minimum greenness were strongly and independently associated with a reduced risk of ADHD. Increasing a child's minimum lifetime greenness exposure, as opposed to maximum or mean exposure, might provide the greatest increment of protection against the disorder. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "The search for the source of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is, I believe, too naive and too much based on guilt for human-related activity. This perception of the world yields analyses that claim to establish an exclusive link between the use of human-made antibiotics and the resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics. This connection neglects the importance of the source of natural antibiotics, which are present in the environment. Most antibiotics are secreted by microorganisms (ie, bacteria) of the actinomycetes phylum, or fungi.1Angelakis E Merhej V Raoult D Related actions of probiotics and antibiotics on gut microbiota and weight modification.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 10889-10899Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (134) Google Scholar The resistance of microorganisms to these natural antibiotics existed long before their medical use. β-lactamases are found in the genetic sequences of microorganisms from the Middle Ages, and the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus in the 19th century has been shown.2Raoult D Rolain JM The living croquet theory: the Staphylococcus aureus paradigm.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2019; published April 12. DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2019.04.005Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar Antibiotics are assembled in microorganisms by non-ribosomal protein synthases and polyketide synthases, which are the only known translation devices outside the ribosome. Their existence might have preceded that of ribosomes and could be archaic translation machineries. Because biodiversity is generally much higher in the humid intertropical zone, as compared with temperate and cold countries, it is also likely to be the place where the most diverse microorganisms are found, as evidenced by the richness of the human microbiota in rural intertropical areas compared with urban or temperate areas.3Angelakis E Bachar D Yasir M et al.Comparison of the gut microbiota of obese individuals from different geographic origins.New Microbes New Infect. 2019; 27: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar This biodiversity can be accompanied by a biodiversity of molecules with antibiotic activity. Additionally, the molecules secreted by non-ribosomal protein synthases and polyketide synthases have multiple activities—not only antimicrobial, but also antifungal. Against eukaryotes, some molecules are used as anticancer treatments. Some human β-lactamases have anticancer drug inhibitory activity as with mitomycin.4Lee SY Brem J Pettinati I et al.Cephalosporins inhibit human metallo β-lactamase fold DNA repair nucleases SNM1A and SNM1B/apollo.Chem Commun. 2016; 52: 406727-406730Google Scholar The spectrum of β-lactamase activity far exceeds anti-β-lactamine activity, playing a role in the digestion of nucleic acid.4Lee SY Brem J Pettinati I et al.Cephalosporins inhibit human metallo β-lactamase fold DNA repair nucleases SNM1A and SNM1B/apollo.Chem Commun. 2016; 52: 406727-406730Google Scholar Antibiotic resistance is a global concern and the source of resistance is often found in the world's intertropical or hottest regions.5Collignon P Beggs JJ Walsh TR Gandra S Laxminarayan R Anthropological and socioeconomic factors contributing to global antimicrobial resistance: a univariate and multivariable analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e398-e405Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar This specificity has not yet been satisfactorily explained, but has been supported by an extensive study by James Hassell and colleagues, which shows that a country's overall antibiotic use is not correlated with the proportion of bacterial resistance;6Hassell JM Ward MJ Muloi D et al.Clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance at the wildlife-livestock-human interface in Nairobi: an epidemiological study.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e259-e269Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar rather, the relationship is inverse: the lower the percentage of antibiotic prescription, the higher the proportion of antimicrobial resistance.5Collignon P Beggs JJ Walsh TR Gandra S Laxminarayan R Anthropological and socioeconomic factors contributing to global antimicrobial resistance: a univariate and multivariable analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e398-e405Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar We have confirmation of this in France, where antibiotic use is one of the highest in the world, and where the proportion of resistance is one of the lowest in the world.7Le Page S Dubourg G Baron SA Rolain JM Raoult D No global increase in resistance to antibiotics: a snapshot of resistance from 2001 to 2016 in Marseille, France.Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2019; 38: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar The same is true in the USA, where difficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacteria represent a small proportion of the bacteria isolated from the blood cultures of hospitalised patients.8Raoult D Rolain JM The paradigm of the Shadoks and antibiotic resistance.Clin Infect Dis. 2019; published online March 6.

Antibiotics can eventually be used as food by other microorganisms, which in turn develop enzymes to digest them for consumption.9Hibbing ME Fuqua C Parsek MR Peterson SB Bacterial competition: surviving and thriving in the microbial jungle.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2010; 8: 115-125Crossref Scopus (1475) Google Scholar Most families of antibiotics can be used as growth factors for soil microorganisms, and the digestion of penicillin and its use as a sole source of carbon has been shown in Escherichia coli transformed in vitro. This finding shows that antibiotics not only kill microorganisms, but also serve as a nutrient, especially in areas rich in environmental microorganisms. In addition, some arthropods have been shown to be capable of secreting penicillins and cephalosporins, leading to a less simplistic view of antibiotics, selection pressure exclusively from human-made drugs, and resistance.10Pontarotti P Raoult D Why do arthropods secrete β-lactams?.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2019; 53: 4370Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar Thus, β-lactam resistance genes are detected in all vertebrates, including humans, but also in archaea, which are not sensitive to β-lactams.11Keshri V Panda A Levasseur A Rolain JM Pontarotti P Raoult D Phylogenomic analysis of β-lactamase in archaea and bacteria enables the identification of putative new members.Genome Biol Evol. 2018; 10: 41106-41114Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar Hassell and colleagues' work6Hassell JM Ward MJ Muloi D et al.Clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance at the wildlife-livestock-human interface in Nairobi: an epidemiological study.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e259-e269Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar shows that in Nairobi, a city where antibiotic prescribing is extremely low,5Collignon P Beggs JJ Walsh TR Gandra S Laxminarayan R Anthropological and socioeconomic factors contributing to global antimicrobial resistance: a univariate and multivariable analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e398-e405Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar the level of resistance of E coli is particularly high, not only in humans, but also in wildlife. This study must put into perspective a much less anthropocentric approach, integrating the fact that antibiotics are probably more than 3 billion years old, as are antibiotic-resistance enzymes, and that we can only understand, and therefore combat antibiotic resistance, if we have a more scientific vision of this world. In conclusion, public health considerations can lead to substantial simplification of a complex issue, in particular to enable the dissemination of simple, understandable health-care messages; however, this process can lead to messaging that is partly false. This issue needs to be acknowledged by the scientific community. Control measures should not prevent the integration of recent scientific data for fear of misuse of antibiotics. This line of thought might end up being dangerous for humans, and more emphasis should be put on the complexity of the relationships between antibiotics and the enzymes that, among others, digest them. I declare no competing interests. Clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance at the wildlife–livestock–human interface in Nairobi: an epidemiological studyUrban wildlife carry a high burden of clinically relevant antimicrobial-resistant E coli in Nairobi, exhibiting resistance to drugs considered crucial for human medicine by WHO. Identifiable traits of the wildlife contribute to this exposure; however, compared with humans, livestock, and the environment, low phenotypic diversity in wildlife is consistent with the hypothesis that wildlife are a net sink rather than source of clinically relevant resistance. Wildlife that interact closely with humans, livestock, and both human and livestock waste within households, are exposed to more antimicrobial resistant phenotypes, and could therefore act as conduits for the dissemination of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance to the wider environment.

    "ab": "BackgroundPlanetary health is an emerging holistic health field that aims to disrupt the boundaries of unidisciplinary research by fostering collaborations, integrating Indigenous knowledge, facilitating education, and driving public and policy engagement. To understand to what degree the field has been successful in meeting this mandate, we conducted a scoping review and bibliometric analysis of the term \"planetary health\" in the peer-reviewed literature.MethodsAn interdisciplinary research team conducted a systematic literature search in 14 databases. The search strategy examined the years 2005–18 with the term \"planetary health\" in title, abstract, or keywords; no limitations were used regarding language or geographical location. Search results were sorted into three different categories: commentaries, education, and original research. Results in the latter were categorised under the themes suggested by the Planetary Health Alliance. Obtained bibliographic data were analysed with the R bibliometrix package.FindingsOur inclusion criteria identified 180 articles. Preliminary analysis showed that most publications (n=153, 85%) were commentaries, calls to action or framework suggestions. 12 publications reported on educational content and 15 publications reported original research. The themes \"nutrition\" and \"changing food systems\" were most commonly discussed in the research papers while \"urbanization\" and \"changing biochemical flows\" were not discussed. Ten publications considered Indigenous knowledge and traditions. The number of publications remained low until 2014 but has tripled since 2017. The USA was the most productive country (32%), followed by the UK (16%), and Australia (9%). The most common keyword was \"climate change\", followed by \"public health\".InterpretationPlanetary health aims to bridge the gaps both between academic fields and beyond academia. However, based on the results of this study, the term is currently mostly used in commentary-like publications. We need to \"spread the word\" to better connect researchers, academic fields, and efforts worldwide and under the planetary health umbrella.FundingNone.",

    "ab": "BackgroundAir pollution undermines people's physical health. So why wouldn't people take actions to reduce air pollution? We argue that social preferences might play a part. Specifically, we examined the links between air pollution, interpersonal trust, and preferences to buy so-called sin stocks (companies that polluted the environment). Because previous research has shown that high pollution induces a belief in immorality as a social norm (akin to \"broken-window\" effect), we predicted that pollution is linked to lower trusting and trustworthy behaviours, and higher likelihood to buy sin stocks. Second, we examined the moderating role of participants' subjective socioeconomic status (SSES). Specifically, previous studies have shown that low SSES induces a feeling of deprivation and higher vulnerability. Therefore, we predicted an interaction between pollution and SSES, such that low SSES participants in highly polluted environment should display the lowest levels of trusting and trustworthy behaviours, and highest likelihood to buy sin stock.MethodsWe recruited 4177 participants residing in 31 provinces of mainland China during January, 2018. Participants were asked to play three incentivised behavioural games measuring their likelihood to buy sin stocks, trusting behaviour, and trustworthiness, respectively. We disseminated our survey via a mobile phone application, making it possible to pay the participants according to their performance on the games, and estimate the instantaneous, real-time air pollution (PM2·5) from dynamic monitoring station data based on each participant's GPS information.FindingsWe found a robust main effect of pollution and an interaction effect between SSES and real-time PM2·5 levels, as we had predicted.InterpretationOur findings counter the common wisdom that people are motivated to take actions to improve their own environment. Instead, a polluted environment could create a bad norm that undermines trust and environmental protection.FundingPartial funding came from a seed grant for the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)—Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) Research Collaboration on Social Psychology offered by the Research Committee of CUHK.",

By 2017, approximately 70% of the 219 million malaria cases were ascribed to ten African countries and India. The report also revealed an estimated additional 3·5 million cases in 2017 compared with 2016 in sub-Saharan Africa, with only 50% coverage of effective vector control in this region.1WHOWorld malaria report 2018.

For example, what definitive role does conventional house screening play as a resistance management approach relative to innovative combinations of eave tubes and insecticides? What would be the implications of waning physical integrity of the screening materials? Given the quite high cost, what would be the sustainable modality for community-wide scale-up?

    "ab": "Climate change is a global issue, but the media coverage it receives differs between countries, including how it is framed and contextualised. How an issue is framed is influenced by the broader socioeconomic and political landscape that the media is embedded in, but how these factors apply to the framing of climate change coverage is not clear. Hong Tien Vu at the University of Kansas and colleagues investigated articles discussing climate change from 45 countries to identify the most popular frames and how national characteristics affected this framing. The most popular ways to frame climate change were in terms of international relations or its economic impacts. In wealthier nations the media were more likely to use domestic politics and scientific evidence framings. Poorer nations' coverage tended to focus on international relations and direct impacts such as rising temperatures and more frequent disasters. Understanding how climate change is framed the way it is can help with understanding the way that the public engage with it and subsequent policy responses. Murders of people defending the environment and the number of countries in which these murders took place have both increased over the past 15 years. In countries such as Brazil and the Philippines, the numbers of deaths in 2017 were sufficient to meet common definitions of an armed conflict (a minimum of 25 deaths per year). Nathalie Butt at the University of Queensland, and colleagues used a database of recorded killings of environmental defenders to investigate the drivers behind this violence, who was most at risk and why. They find that in 2017, 185 recorded killings were identified, with Indigenous peoples representing about 30% of the victims. Conflicts over resources were the core drivers of violence, with agriculture, mining, and logging the most common industries involved. Killings were more likely in countries with weak rule of law and high corruption, indicating the need for governments and private sector stakeholders to investigate their supply chains, commit to eliminating violence, and be held accountable on their performance. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) encompass a very ambitious and broadly-based set of objectives. Making progress on all these fronts while minimising trade-offs is a tremendously challenging task, and some goals may even have a degree of inherent incompatibility. These relationships between indicators, though much discussed, are rarely analysed in practice. To investigate the compatibility of human development and conservation efforts Judith Ament at the Zoological Society of London and colleagues explore relationships between indicators of human development and wildlife abundance—birds and mammals—in the landscape (outside of protected areas) between 1996 and 2015. In lower income country settings, they find negative relationships between human population growth and bird and mammal abundance but a positive relationship between economic growth and wildlife population trends. Encouragingly, these findings suggest that there is much potential compatibility between conservation and development agendas. However, effective policy integration is not a given and further systematic integration research and practice among sustainable development strategies and disciplines is warranted. The social cost of carbon—the net economic damage to society resulting from each additional ton of CO2 emitted—is an economic concept which exerts great influence on climate policy. Its value is computed with Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). These are essentially comprised of a set of “damage functions” used to estimate harm to society per ton of CO2 emitted and monetise it. Noah Scovronick from Emory University and co-authors select the social cost of carbon for closer inspection because the damage functions used to monetise the impacts of carbon emissions have been developed largely by economists without active participation of other specialists including health researchers. Consequently, they argue that conducting research applicable to damage functions is a unique opportunity for health professionals to directly inform climate policy. They go on to summarise the damage functions of the three leading IAM's used to calculate the social cost of carbon and describe specific study design characteristics that will help make research results applicable to future damage function application.",

    "ab": "Just over a year ago, the IPCC published a Special Report outlining what it would take to prevent global heating of more than 1·5°C and 2°C above preindustrial levels, and the projected impacts of each outcome. For many climate change insiders this felt like it was going to be a “more of the same” report. One that provided updated and stronger, but largely confirmatory information on the emission cuts needed to avoid the most damaging effects of climate breakdown and meet the Paris Agreement objectives. In certain respects that was true, but the report has undoubtedly made an impact in the world as discussed in a Feature in this issue. One of the key messages, that if we are to limit warming to 1·5°C then greenhouse gas emissions need to be halved by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 brought home in clear terms what Naomi Klein had previously observed about climate change, “This changes everything.” These cuts and the short time in which they need to be made reveal the climate crisis to be not simply a big bump in the road that stretches out before us, but a chasm that cannot be navigated through conventional means, and without wanting to stretch the analogy too far, a growing chasm caused by the very means of travel we have been utilising. There is, as yet, no agreed plan for accomplishing the herculean task of emissions reduction even among those who do not deny the overwhelming evidence of climate heating, and naturally people hold very different perspectives on how the chasm should best be navigated. Perhaps the most fundamental and therefore controversial question relates to the role of continuing global economic growth in the pursuit of planetary health. Economic growth as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is at the very core of the economic system we are accustomed to, and for many economic growth is the very engine needed for a green transition. Indeed, Sustainable Development Goal eight enshrines economic growthcentral to the 2030 Agenda. We have become so accustomed to equating GDP growth with human progress and increased wellbeing that it is almost heretical to question the necessity for ever more growth, but here is the crux of the issue. Economists tend to think of the economy as being freed from the material constraints of the world by the ingenuity of humankind, but empirical evidence shows that growth in the economy has always involved comparable growth in resource use. When Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, was recently challenged on the issue of endless growth being impossible on a finite planet he remarked that he does not accept that, arguing instead that “there is carbon-light growth, there is asset-light growth”. Is he right? The answer depends on whether we can decouple economic growth from carbon and wider resource use fast enough and to a sufficient extent to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 while the global economy grows by around 3% per year. This equates to a doubling just over every 20 years, or approximately once every generation. Investigations into the rate of decarbonisation required to meet the Paris objectives in a growing global economy show them to be well above what is likely achievable, based on modelling and historical evidence. This shortfall has been dealt with by assuming that negative emissions technologies can be brought in to fill the gap. However, these technologies remain almost completely untested at the scale required to meaningfully impact atmospheric CO2 levels. The IPCC 1·5° C report did investigate a scenario for reducing emissions in line with the Paris Agreement that does not rely on negative emissions technology development. This Low Energy Demand scenario assumes reductions in global energy consumption of 40% by 2050, making the transition to 100% clean energy much more achievable. The key feature of this scenario is that global material production and consumption declines significantly. In other words, a planned reduction in the material and energy throughput of the global economy; what is sometimes referred to as degrowth. It remains unclear whether the pursuit of endless global economic growth is the engine of our salvation or our demise, but there is enough evidence to have some scepticism that growth is always good for people and the planet. The issues at stake are too important for this to rest on thought experiments, and faith. If we are to tackle the ecological and climate emergencies and make progress on human wellbeing, we need to be willing to investigate the very heart of our economy. A year of pushing for 1·5°CTo many, it seemed unlikely to have an impact. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "We appreciate the comments by Kaylee Ho and colleagues1Ho K Paez J Liu B Air quality alerts benefit asthmatics.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: 518Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar on our study,2Chen H Li Q Kaufman JS et al.Effect of air quality alerts on human health: a regression discontinuity analysis in Toronto, Canada.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e19-e26Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar in which we evaluated the influence of an air quality alert programme on a wide array of health outcomes in Toronto, Canada. The Correspondence by Ho and colleagues presented an analysis using the 2007–10 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the USA, showing that individuals who had asthma were more likely to change their behaviours in response to deterioration in air quality than those without asthma.3Zipf G Chiappa M Porter KS Ostchega Y Lewis BG Dostal J National health and nutrition examination survey: plan and operations, 1999–2010.Vital Health Stat 1. 2013; 56: 1-37Google Scholar Their finding adds to the ongoing scientific discussion as to whether an air quality alert programme might encourage avoidance behaviours (eg, reducing outdoor travelling and physical activities) on days with high levels of pollution. Although we applaud the efforts made by Ho and colleagues to provide an explanation to one of our findings that air quality alerts were related to some reduction in asthma-related emergency department visits, their method is somewhat unclear. Without presenting the number of non-asthmatics, there is some ambiguity as to whether the four strata (lifetime asthma, current asthma, asthma attack in the past year, and asthma emergency department visit in the past year) were indeed mutually exclusive. In addition, it is uncertain whether the question about behavioural changes was responded to by both asthmatics and non-asthmatics, or only by individuals with asthma. Furthermore, Ho and colleagues compared the proportion of individuals who changed activity because of poor air quality between asthmatics and non-asthmatics within each of the four strata. This appears to imply that individuals who do not have asthma were also included in the four strata. Despite our observation that air quality alerts were related to some decreases in asthma emergency department visits, we did not detect a reduction in any of the other health outcomes examined. One important implication of these findings is that measures focusing only on days with the highest levels of pollution are unlikely to help to address the most harmful effects of air pollution, given the role of long-term air pollution exposure as a risk factor for major chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases. Although there is an increasing interest in developing innovative programmes, such as personalised systems to protect high-risk subgroups from air pollution, converging scientific evidence over the past decades suggests that air pollution problems are best addressed through collective and enforceable actions. Such actions could be improvement in fuel standards and emission control, especially targeting specific sources such as power generation and industries that contribute substantially to air pollution, and improvement in urban and transportation planning, rather than advising individuals and leaving to them to protect themselves from the harmful effects of air pollution. We declare no competing interests. Air quality alerts benefit asthmaticsWe have read with interest the Article by Hong Chen and colleagues,1 particularly the evidence of reductions in asthma-related emergency-department visits associated with air quality alert programmes in Toronto (ON, Canada). We have compared changes in activity between people with asthma and people who do not have asthma using representative data from the 2007–10 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the USA.2 Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "The Lancet Planetary Health addressed the issue of coal mining in the USA and the need for a fast reduction in intensive coal use.1The Lancet Planetary HealthMining the USA.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: E324Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 2The Lancet Planetary HealthIs the time for coal in Europe over?.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: E233Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar It should be noted that the USA and the EU are adopting different policies concerning coal mining incentives and coal use. The EU has adopted a general framework to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 2050, including decreasing extraction and burning of coal. Some countries, such as the UK and Italy, have set their withdrawal from coal use even earlier (by 2025). In February, 2018, the new EU Emission Trade System was approved, fixing a limit to coal price reduction and funding technological innovations. Moreover, applied research projects have been funded for coal-free steel production in Austria (Voestalpine), Germany (Salzgitter), and Sweden (Lund-HYBRIT) to test steel production by use of hydrogen and natural gas, in the frame of a general perspective of Clean Steel fostered by the European Commission. These pilots were presented at the Europe Beyond Carbon conference held at the European Parliament (Brussels, Belgium) on June 20, 2018, with the involvement of the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, and in Taranto (Italy) on Nov 26, 2018. The EU has also launched the Coal Regions in Transition Platform, in which the European Commission and financial institutions (eg, World Bank) set up bilateral meetings with mining regions to fund transition to a coal-free economy. A specific Horizon 2020 Call was opened to support actions for the development of regional roadmaps towards decarbonisation in coal-intensive regions. The European perspective on decarbonisation and long term emissions reduction was officially presented (EU's vision for a modern, clean, and competitive economy) by the European Commission on July 10–11, 2018, at the University of Brussels (Brussels, Belgium) as an important step towards COP24 held in Katowice, Poland, promoted by the UN to address the issue of climate change and its consequences on planetary health. The ambitious objective of coal use reduction set for 2050 should promote a deep reconsideration of the future of the EU steel industry, in which the traditional and low-value steel coming from coal-intensive processes does not have a long-term future. The EU should promote a new generation of plants able to produce clean and intelligent steel (with innovative material properties and characteristics). The new multiannual financial programme (2020–27) should devote relevant resources to stimulate and accelerate these changes and support Member States to create favourable conditions for a new sustainable and intelligent steel market. Mining the USAOn June 20, US President Donald Trump announced his intention to open up large areas of Minnesota's Superior National Forest to industrial activity, a move likely to benefit the mining company Twin Metals Mining Minnesota, which has previously expressed interest in this region. More precisely, Trump's plan is to undo one of his predecessor Barack Obama's final acts as president, a 20-year ban on industrial activity across about 234 000 acres of the national forest while studies on the potential environmental impacts of any mining-related activity are completed.

    "ab": "We agree with Koen B Pouwels and colleagues, that association does not mean cause and effect. In our paper, we acknowledged limitations in using national-level data on antibiotic usage and resistance patterns, and that antibiotic use is an important factor in antibiotic resistance. We note that our results, which show that the spread of resistant bacteria by anthropological factors is at least as important as antibiotic use, are supported by other studies.1Baker S Thomson N Weill FX Holt KE Genomic insights into the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pathogens.Science. 2018; 360: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar Antibiotic sales data (IQVIA MIDAS database) have limitations, but these data provide the only source of harmonised global information on antibiotic consumption. Others have validated IQVIA MIDAS and demonstrated strong correlation with data from the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network.2Klein EY Van Boeckel TP Martinez EM et al.Global increase and geographic convergence in antibiotic consumption between 2000 and 2015.Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018; 115: E3463-E3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar We used global resistance data on 114 member states from WHO. We also used data from ResistanceMap and interrogated literature searches on Escherichia coli resistance. The results we observed were similar across the datasets. Some associations could be surrogates for other markers that are underappreciated—even Pouwels' example of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus linked to unfair play of national football teams. This behaviour might reflect the culture of a country where rules are more often ignored, and thus, where support for hand hygiene campaigns, sensible antibiotic use and adequate public infrastructure are more likely scarce. Previous multivariate analysis3Collignon P Athukorala PC Senanayake S Khan F Antimicrobial resistance: the major contribution of poor governance and corruption to this growing problem.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0116746Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar has also shown that higher levels of corruption are associated with higher antibiotic resistance rates. Others have shown that greater corruption is associated with higher regional antibiotic usage volumes within Europe.4Rönnerstrand B Lapuente V Corruption and use of antibiotics in regions of Europe.Health Policy. 2017; 121: 250-256Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar We used multiple regression analysis to disentangle many of the issues raised by Pouwels and colleagues. Since there is collinearity between some of the explanatory variables (eg, health system strength and antibiotics consumption), we observed a narrower list of statistically significant associations with multiregression than in our univariate analysis. Pouwels' supplementary figure, using purely simulated datapoints, serves to illustrate the well known problem that arises in interpreting simple bivariate correlations. Such graphs could equally well be drawn to imply a positive correlation of usage and resistance when in fact the underlying relationship is negative. The graphs in our appendix demonstrate that when important explanatory variables are not accounted for in the modelling (eg, poor infrastructure, poor health care expenditure), aggregated data can imply either a spurious positive or a spurious negative correlation between usage and resistance, even when there is no underlying relationship. We do not agree with Cédric Abat and colleagues, that “all simplifications including stating that antibiotic consumption in humans and animals favours the emergence of antibiotic resistance appear inherently wrong.” Rather, we agree there are examples where antibiotic usage does not correlate with observed resistance levels; however, there are also examples where positive linkages have been found.3Collignon P Athukorala PC Senanayake S Khan F Antimicrobial resistance: the major contribution of poor governance and corruption to this growing problem.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0116746Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Nasrin D Collignon PJ Roberts L Wilson EJ Pilotto LS Douglas RM Effect of beta lactam antibiotic use in children on pneumococcal resistance to penicillin: prospective cohort study.BMJ. 2002; 324: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Goossens H Ferech M Stichele RM Elseviers M Outpatient antibiotic use in Europe and association with resistance: a cross-national database study.Lancet. 2005; 365: 579-587Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar We agree with what seems implicit in Abat's letter and associated references—namely, that a reduction of antibiotic consumption alone will not be sufficient to control antimicrobial resistance. We think that improving sanitation, increasing access to clean water, ensuring good governance, and increasing public health-care expenditure are all necessary to reduce global antimicrobial resistance. We believe that our conclusion remains appropriate, that contagion—the spread of resistant strains and resistance genes—seems to be a dominant contributing factor to global antibiotic resistance.

Full-Text PDF Open AccessAntibiotic resistance, stewardship, and consumptionPeter Collignon and colleagues1 aim to improve understanding of global antibiotic resistance drivers by quantifying associations between antibiotic resistance and potential contributing factors. A recent systematic review including 565 studies primarily reporting patient-level data found that antibiotic exposure, underlying disease, and invasive procedures had the greatest evidence of being antibiotic resistance drivers.2 Given the small evidence base for the role of community factors,2 we fully concur with Collignon and colleagues about the importance of considering such factors in the spread of antibiotic resistance. Full-Text PDF Open AccessAntibiotic resistance, stewardship, and consumptionWe read with interest the work of Peter Collignon and colleagues,1 in which the authors studied the effect of cofactors on the prevalence of precise antibiotic resistance profiles. Amongst their discoveries, the authors identified inverse relationships between global antibiotic consumption and the antibiotic resistance profiles that they studied.

Despite recognition of these best practices, the gap between research and the translation of findings into policy and practice is wide, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Research done by academics rarely matches the needs of policy makers. Policy makers are often more interested in whether the results of research are implementable than in the research itself. Therefore, whereas most academics view the outcome of their research as useful for informing policy, their research often has little utility for policy formulation.2Lavis JN Oxman AD Lewin S Fretheim A SUPPORT Tools for evidence-informed health Policymaking (STP) 3: Setting priorities for supporting evidence -informed policymaking.Health Res Policy Syst. 2009; 7: S3Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar The mismatch between funder priorities and local needs also renders research evidence inadequate for translation into policy.3Chalmers I Bracken MB Djulbegovic B et al.How to increase value and reduce waste when research priorities are set.Lancet. 2014; 383: 156-165Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar The communication gap between researchers, funders, and policy makers further reinforces the mismatch. All these factors result in a failure to use evidence in policy making and action. This failure highlights the need for research to be informed and prioritised by stakeholder needs, to ensure that research evidence is translated to policy and practice.4Ioannidis JPA Greenland S Hlatky MA et al.Increasing value and reducing waste in research design, conduct, and analysis.Lancet. 2014; 383: 166-175Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar Social, economic, scientific, engineering, and medical evidence is used to support development of policy and delivery of services to the public. The translation of evidence to policy and practice can be especially problematic in the environmental health domain, particularly in countries with lax regulations, where business practices leading to illegal pollution are the norm, and where citizens often lack informational, organisational, legal, and political resources to mobilise support for action. In such instances, regulatory interventions through the justice courts have often proven to be successful (panel).PanelExamples of environmental litigationsIn 2013, the National Green Tribunal in India blocked plans for a 1050 MW coalfired power plant in Korba, Chattisgarh, on the grounds that the area was already critically polluted and the environmental impact assessment failed to consider the cumulative impact due to the proposed project.5Environmental Law Alliance WorldwidePolluting Coal Plant Stopped in Cuddalore.https://www.elaw.org/polluting-coal-plant-stopped-in-cuddaloreDate: 2014Date accessed: January 13, 2019Google ScholarIn 2003, in the case of Washington Toxics Coalition versus the US Environmental Protection Agency, the District Court ruled in favour of Washington Toxics Coalition and banned the use of 54 pesticides from waters supporting salmon populations in California, Oregon, and Washington.6US Environmental Protection AgencyEndangered Species Case—Washington Toxics Coalition v.

Judicial interventions, initiated by affected communities, citizen groups, and environmental organisations, have argued for the right to a clean and pollution-free environment and against corruption and inaction, within a human rights framework. Scientific evidence and conclusions are central to environmental litigation and are frequently contested.8Sali K Scientific evidence in environmental litigation.Nat Resources Environ. 2016; 30: 1-4Google Scholar Although the legal profession uses research evidence to affect policy change and action across the world in pollution abatement, it has been left out as a key stakeholder of research uptake. Public-interest lawyers often lack the tools and skills to critically appraise scientific literature; nor do they have the technical expertise or support from domain experts to provide supporting scientific evidence for their arguments. The scientific community for its part is apprehensive or not well informed of the legal procedures and court processes. This highlights the need for the environmental and public health research community to engage and collaborate with legal professionals to provide the relevant scientific evidence necessary to manage litigation processes. Additionally, the research community needs to recognise the legal pathway for formulating evidence-informed policies and the opportunities and challenges to produce evidence that is relevant to the legal community.

To strengthen such legal mechanisms, we believe that greater collaboration between the legal and environmental and public health communities is necessary. Such collaboration will provide impetus for the generation of research evidence that can strengthen the legal mechanisms and increase policy-level interventions for pollution control, especially in poorly regulated LMICs.

Amongst their discoveries, the authors identified inverse relationships between global antibiotic consumption and the antibiotic resistance profiles that they studied. Although some of the links they published remain for us unclear, these inverse relationships between antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption confirm our Alice's living croquet theory.2Raoult D Alice's living croquet theory.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2016; 47: 249Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar Indeed, this theory, based on the game croquet illustrated in the novel Alice in Wonderland, suggests that it is impossible to predict the future for living beings, as the living world is governed by several factors and interactions that no single mathematical model can explain. As this tenet can also be applied to antibiotic resistance, all simplifications including stating that antibiotic consumption in humans and animals favours the emergence of antibiotic resistance appear inherently wrong. First, antibiotic resistance is not new and might result from a long history of intermicrobial conflict.3Rolain J-M Abat C Jimeno M-T Fournier P-E Raoult D Do we need new antibiotics?.Clin Microbiol Infect. 2016; 22: 408-415Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar Second, in patients hospitalised at our institution for bacteraemia and cerebrospinal fluid infections, the proportion of infections caused by invasive meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decreased from 31·0% in 2001 to 12·8% in 2015, which occurred without any screening or isolation procedures being performed.3Rolain J-M Abat C Jimeno M-T Fournier P-E Raoult D Do we need new antibiotics?.Clin Microbiol Infect. 2016; 22: 408-415Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar We recently identified in low-income and middle-income countries that the increases in antibiotic consumption inversely paralleled deaths caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, leading us to warn against the inclination to limit antibiotic consumption in these countries.5Abat C Gautret P Raoult D Benefits of antibiotics burden in low-income countries.Proc Natl Acad Sci. 2018; 115: e8109-e8110Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar The results from Collignon and colleagues1Collignon P Beggs JJ Walsh TR Gandra S Laxminarayan R Anthropological and socioeconomic factors contributing to global antimicrobial resistance: a univariate and multivariable analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e398-e405Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar support our conclusions. We declare no competing interests Anthropological and socioeconomic factors contributing to global antimicrobial resistance: a univariate and multivariable analysisReduction of antibiotic consumption will not be sufficient to control antimicrobial resistance because contagion—the spread of resistant strains and resistance genes—seems to be the dominant contributing factor. Improving sanitation, increasing access to clean water, and ensuring good governance, as well as increasing public health-care expenditure and better regulating the private health sector are all necessary to reduce global antimicrobial resistance. Full-Text PDF Open AccessAntibiotic resistance, stewardship, and consumptionPeter Collignon and colleagues1 aim to improve understanding of global antibiotic resistance drivers by quantifying associations between antibiotic resistance and potential contributing factors. A recent systematic review including 565 studies primarily reporting patient-level data found that antibiotic exposure, underlying disease, and invasive procedures had the greatest evidence of being antibiotic resistance drivers.2 Given the small evidence base for the role of community factors,2 we fully concur with Collignon and colleagues about the importance of considering such factors in the spread of antibiotic resistance. Full-Text PDF Open AccessAntibiotic resistance, stewardship, and consumption – Authors' replyWe agree with Koen B Pouwels and colleagues, that association does not mean cause and effect. In our paper, we acknowledged limitations in using national-level data on antibiotic usage and resistance patterns, and that antibiotic use is an important factor in antibiotic resistance. We note that our results, which show that the spread of resistant bacteria by anthropological factors is at least as important as antibiotic use, are supported by other studies.1 Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "Dar es Salaam's Urban Malaria Control Project (UMCP) was launched in 2004 with the objective of implementing and assessing a microbial larviciding intervention. From 2004 to 2008, malaria prevalence decreased from 28% to less than 2%.1Maheu-Giroux M Castro M Impact of community-based larviciding on the prevalence of malaria infection in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e71638Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar This collapse of malaria vector populations was also observed in neighbouring regions of Tanzania.2Meyrowitsch DW Pedersen EM Alifrangis M et al.Is the current decline in malaria burden in sub-Saharan Africa due to a decrease in vector population?.Malar J. 2011; 10: 188Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar Part of the reduction preceded the initiation of larviciding activities and the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapies. Yet, previous analyses suggested that larviciding was effective in reducing malaria prevalence.1Maheu-Giroux M Castro M Impact of community-based larviciding on the prevalence of malaria infection in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e71638Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Lawson AB Carroll R Castro M Joint spatial Bayesian modeling for studies combining longitudinal and cross-sectional data.Stat Methods Med Res. 2014; 23: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar In their Article, Gerry Killeen and colleagues4Killeen GF Govella NJ Mlacha YP Chaki PP Suppression of malaria vector densities and human infection prevalence associated with scale-up of mosquito-proofed housing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: re-analysis of an observational series of parasitological and entomological surveys.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e132-e143Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar reanalysed the UMCP data. Although it is reassuring that most of their results confirm those previously reported, their paper raises important concerns. First, the rollout of larviciding followed a stepped-wedge design. It involved sequential crossover of the city's wards from control to intervention such that, ultimately, all wards received the larviciding intervention. This implies that calendar time is a potentially crucial confounder and, following standard practice, must be included in the analyses.5Hemming K Haines TP Chilton PJ Girling AJ Lilford RJ The stepped wedge cluster randomised trial: rationale, design, analysis, and reporting.BMJ. 2015; 350: h391Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar Substituting another covariate for time in the model could grossly overestimate the intervention's impact. A second concern is that the authors mistakenly state that earlier analyses did not adjust for within-ward covariance. This is incorrect because previously reported odds ratios for larviciding included this adjustment in sensitivity analyses using ward-level fixed effects—confirming their robustness. The advantage of this specification is that it controls for “any time-invariant measured or unmeasured confounders of the larviciding-malaria relationship”,1Maheu-Giroux M Castro M Impact of community-based larviciding on the prevalence of malaria infection in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e71638Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar which is especially important for the UMCP whose larviciding allocation sequence was not randomised. Using fixed effects therefore provides a more robust estimate than using a random effects specification. Third, attributing changes in an observed health outcome to one specific intervention requires an appropriate control group. Although it is plausible that improved house proofing had a role in reducing malaria transmission, attributing the reduction to this factor alone, as implied by their analyses substituting calendar time, does not follow principles of causal attribution. The authors disregard household-level variations in house proofing to use city-wide coverage (with unrealistic discrepancies between the two estimates) and do not consider potential confounders. From 2002 to 2012, Dar es Salaam's population increased from 2·5 million to 4·3 million people and its density nearly doubled. There were noticeable reductions in urban agriculture, increases in bednet usage, introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy, and clear improvements in literacy and socioeconomic status during the UMCP. The decision to attribute the bulk of the malaria decline to improved housing seems arbitrary and could misguide public health efforts by overstating its potential benefits. We declare no competing interests. Suppression of malaria vector densities and human infection prevalence associated with scale-up of mosquito-proofed housing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: re-analysis of an observational series of parasitological and entomological surveysCommunity-wide mosquito proofing of houses might deliver greater impacts on vector populations and malaria transmission than previously thought. The spontaneous nature of the scale-up observed here is also encouraging with regards to practicality, acceptability, and affordability in low-income settings. Full-Text PDF Open AccessAttribution of reductions in malaria prevalence in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania – Authors' replyWe thank Mathieu Maheu-Giroux and Marcia Castro for their Correspondence about our Article.1 Regarding concerns about the stepped-wedge design of the larviciding scale-up in our study, we agree and also note that scale-up was not randomised, but rather introduced earliest to the best-prepared wards. However, such compromises are normal and healthy in pragmatic assessments of effectiveness under realistic programmatic conditions, rather than efficacy under artificially controlled experimental conditions.

    "ab": "Since 2000, in its first edition, the Daisies March has been consolidating itself as one of the largest social movements of women in Latin America, focusing in the fight against violence and in the search for autonomy for the women of rural areas, forests, and riversides, in a way inherently related to the socio-environmental sustainability of their communities and to the notion of planetary health. Recent studies have shown that actions that associate, for example, the reduction of carbon emissions to the promotion of gender equity, are more effective in their environmental results and in the more equitable distribution of income generated.1Cook NJ Grillos T Andersson KP Gender quotas increase the equality and effectiveness of climate policy interventions.Nat Clim Chang. 2019; 9: 330-334Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar In this project, we present the process of transformation of the guidelines claimed in the 2019 March in a didactic unit, suitable for popular education actions to be conducted by partners of the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers. The planned educational actions promote the voices of Rural Workers' Unions, family farmers, and public schools for the development of debates and referral of local actions aimed at more equal access to land and water; the development of local agroecological techniques; the food and energy sovereignty of rural, forest, and riversides communities; the conservation of socio-biodiversity; access to public health; economic autonomy, work, and income for women; and access to sexual and reproductive rights. As a pilot study, the actions will be conducted in five different municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul, during the year 2019, through a partnership with the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and have raised possible actions aiming to increase gender equity and promote planetary health. Contributors TC is an academic consultant of National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG), for the development of activities of 2019 Daisies March. EFdB has contributed to the introduction of planetary health concept in the discussions promoted by this women's social movement. Declaration of interests We declare no competing interests.",

    "ab": "The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report highlights community-based strategies to drive effective and ecologically sustainable local adaptation strategies. A climate change hot spot, Sundarbans, India, needs collective action between communities and for local level health and non-health decision makers to find sustainable solutions to combat the impacts of climate change on child health. In our photovoice study, mothers examined mediating factors by which climate change was impacting their child's health. Over 80 mothers with at least one child aged 0–6 years took photographs to document the impact of climate change on factors affecting child health. During facilitated fortnightly group meetings, mothers identified and categorised the major factors affecting their children's health. Participants collectively selected the photographs most reflective of the mediating factors and presented their findings to the local and state health administrations to identify mutually agreeable solutions. Mothers identified five mediating factors. These included food security, livelihood, water and sanitation, accessibility of the health-care system, and breaching of embankments. The findings were presented by the mothers to community-level and state-level policy makers. The interactions resulted in the initiation of resilient road infrastructure, increased human resource availability in primary health centres during floods, and local government representatives demanding long-term adaptation strategies to address climate impacts. Child health is affected by climate change through multiple pathways. Participatory approaches like photo voice can be used effectively to reflect ground level experiences of climate-vulnerable communities, empower them, and provide a collaborative and inclusive platform to design policies and initiatives for the creation of climate resilient health systems and communities.

    "ab": "Indigenous knowledge and traditional practices around indigenous small grains are critical tools in the quest to improve community health and adapt to climate change. As a scholar and an artist, I work with Indigenous communities in Sikkim in the Indian Himalayas and in Mazvihwa, Zimbabwe, documenting nutritious and drought-tolerant indigenous small grains using arts-based methodologies, such as drawing. This course of study began with my 13 months of fieldwork (2011–12) in the Lepcha Indigenous community in Sikkim. I demonstrated how dependence on a monocultural cardamom agricultural system introduced in the 1950s had collapsed due to plant disease while local agricultural biodiversity was being lost. This research used both qualitative and quantitative methods, involving case studies at three scales on land use changes in the Lepcha territory following the expansion of cardamom. The first is a coarse-grained GIS study of land use change for the village from 1989 to 2012. The other two are fine-grained key-informant interview studies—one on land use change, and the second on the persistence of traditional food plants. I found a decline in crop diversity in the area devoted to the monocultural cardamom cash crop system. Thus I documented 36 neglected traditional food plants with my illustrations, including 16 indigenous small grains, and 20 gathered plants, representing 14 different plant families. Decreased cash crop production was also evident in Mazvihwa. During the preliminary field study in 2016, I found that indigenous small grains survived in the fields significantly more often than monocultural maize. There I conducted drawing workshops, created an opportunity for community members to reconnect to the neglected plants, and to revalue their Indigenous knowledge. My project builds a collective community resource as communities reflect on their traditional skills and knowledge around neglected small grains, contributing to maintaining agricultural biodiversity and ultimately contributes to planetary health.

    "ab": "BackgroundClimate change threatens human health, but there is a lack of evidence on the economic toll of these risks. Health-related cost estimates for climate-sensitive impacts illuminate an understudied impact of climate change and highlight how this threat is affecting sectors beyond property and infrastructure. Furthermore, cost estimates can guide health interventions and help public health professionals assess whether climate change adaptation measures are achieving their intended benefits.MethodsWe estimate mortality and morbidity costs associated with ten climate-sensitive case studies spanning eleven US states in 2012 (when the country experienced some of its warmest weather to date); the case studies include wildfires, extreme heat, West Nile Virus and Lyme disease, extreme precipitation and flooding, harmful algal blooms, allergenic pollen, ozone air pollution, and a major hurricane. We estimate the mortality and morbidity associated with each event using data reported in peer-reviewed epidemiology studies, state and federal data, and environmental public health tracking network data collected by state public health agencies. We augment this information with imputed incidence data from national healthcare utilisation statistics.FindingsApplying value of a statistical life and cost-of-illness approaches to publicly-available data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, we estimate total health-related costs associated with these case studies (from 917 deaths, 20 568 hospitalisations and 17 857 emergency department visits) of about $10·0 billion in 2018 dollars, with a sensitivity range of $2·7 billion to $24·6 billion.InterpretationBy better characterising these health damages in economic terms, this work helps characterise the burden that climate change already places on human health. In doing so, we provide a quantitative framework for broader estimation of climate-sensitive health-related costs. Expanded quantification of the budgetary pressures posed by climate change can help decision makers engage with the scale of the challenge and prioritise efficient adaptation strategies to protect public health.FundingNone.",

Common factors driving youth migration include environmental degradation, war and conflict, and lack of economic opportunity and poverty. In collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), our aim was to study the effect of migration on the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs of youth in Nairobi, Cairo, Beirut, and Tunis through the development of technological solutions for data collection and identification of youth most vulnerable to SRH issues.MethodsWe designed a web application useful for both migrants and researchers that contains a 27-question survey to collect migrant data on basic profile metrics such as their geographical journey and their sexual relations. This data can be used to inform the UNFPA's service, delivery, and policy efforts. The website also features a geographical healthcare centres map and safety tips for migrants. Additionally, we artificially created a dataset of 1000 migrant profiles to train a machine learning model to predict SRH vulnerabilities in young people.FindingsThe neural network model and the support vector machines algorithm demonstrated high accuracies of 0·92 and 0·90 respectively in predicting the most vulnerable youth. We optimised our algorithm to minimise false-negatives, even at the cost of a few false-positives.InterpretationOur results provide an opportunity to identify vulnerable youth for local officials to potentially reach out to in order to prevent SRH issues and to understand how such vulnerabilities might stem from their environmental and structural migration factors. Furthermore, researchers can investigate based on data collected from the web application how overcrowding of migrants in urban areas outstrips the areas of resources to further compromise the SRH health of the migrants.FundingNone.",

    "ab": "BackgroundUrban environments are placing an increasing burden on our life support systems. Research is needed further upstream in urban governance and on the role of economic valuation in critical decision-making. The three-year pilot study, Moving Health Upstream in Urban Development (UPSTREAM), funded by Wellcome, has made a small, but important contribution to research in this area. We report here on the results of the workstream to quantify the scale of the impact that the built environment has on health in monetary terms.MethodsFollowing a systematic literature review carried out by University of the West of England, observed health impacts associated with different characteristics of the environment were applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 people. Unit values for the societal cost of around 60 health outcomes were defined using existing valuation evidence. Reference values were established for the intervals between worst-case and best-case scenarios in the UK new build housing context.FindingsWe estimated the societal value of health impacts arising from 26 characteristics of the built environment, including green space, air quality, noise, overheating and proximity to a main road. It is possible to use these findings to compare the relative importance of each feature.InterpretationEven in the context of a well-regulated sector, the UK new build environment shows potential for significant differences in health impacts between the best and worst quality of design. Although interior conditions such as thermal comfort are important, it is the wider environmental context such as green space and air quality where the largest impacts occur. We have shown that this potential for change can be monetised in terms of the impact on health, using a metric that might be useful for social planners.FundingThe Wellcome Trust.",

    "ab": "A good proportion of our editorial column space this year has been devoted to the stream of scientific reports summarising the full extent of the global climate and biodiversity emergencies we face and the popular movements that have arisen as a result of the lacklustre and frankly insufficient government and business response to these emergencies. Last month saw one of the largest coordinated international demonstrations in history. An estimated six million people took to the streets in the youth led climate strikes timed to try to influence the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. These movements are certainly raising the profile of climate change and the need to rapidly cut emission and reverse ecological degradation. The overall picture from the summit though was disappointing, we still aren't seeing decarbonisation at the scale and pace needed to even have a 50% chance of meeting the Paris Agreements objectives. In particular most of the plans submitted by the major economies lacked sufficient ambition with few national leaders displaying any real idea how they will implement their existing emissions reduction commitments let alone ramp up their ambition. This is perhaps not surprising since the scale of the challenge is large, and it represents a major departure from business as usual thinking and planning. It's all too easy for difficult decisions to be put off for others and for national leaders to blame other nations for not doing enough to curb their emissions. As a concerned citizen seeing our socio-political juggernaut on a collision course and taking little evasive action what options do we have? For many the answer is to rebel. October is set to witness an International Rebellion lead by the group Extinction Rebellion (XR). Many participants are willing to go a stage further than the climate strikers and in addition to taking to the streets to demonstrate the scale of public support for action to avert environmental crises there will be many acts of peaceful civil disobedience. We won't know the scale of these efforts until after this issue is published but events are planned in cities from Toronto, New York, Sydney, Buenos Aries and Istanbul to name just a few. Given how effective previous such rebellions have been in raising the profile of climate and ecological breakdown earlier this year it is hard to imagine this will not have further impact no matter how you might feel about the disruption. It seems those in the highest corridors of power really haven't woken up to how serious these challenges are or how significant the level of public feeling is becoming. The traditional academic approach to policy change is to provide ever more and better information and hope that politicians, legislators and the business community are paying attention and become convinced by the arguments. That approach has proved largely unsuccessful so far, particularly in mobilising climate change mitigation actions, but the combination of public activism backed up with authoritative scientific assessments does seem a powerful one. It's hard to dismiss these activists, even teenagers taking time off school, when the arguments they make are largely a correct representation of the best available science. The protests represent both a counter-culture movement, challenging existing social and economic norms, and an appeal to the conventional authority of science. The IPCC's latest Special Report on the ocean and cryosphere released in September provided an update on the scientific picture since the IPCC's fifth assessment report (AR5) – published in 2013-14. There is little that will surprise those who have read previous reports but it is noteworthy that many changes are occurring at a rate and magnitude erring towards the high end of projected scenarios. The report serves to remind us that everyone depends directly or indirectly on the ocean and cryosphere, and warns that communities in close connection with coastal environments, small islands, polar regions and high mountains are particularly exposed to projected levels of sea level rise, glacier melt and permafrost thaw. The report reiterates the need for urgent and ambitious emissions reductions coupled with sustained and ambitious adaptation actions to avert the climate impacts that are already locked in. If you are concerned about climate change and ecological collapse and their implications for society, there is a great deal of evidence that you are right to be concerned but little conventional leadership in taking the steps necessary to address these issues. What choice do people have left but to peacefully rebel?",

    "ab": "Groundwater extraction by pumping from underground aquifers is crucial to support agriculture and other human activities in areas where surface water supplies are insufficient. However, extraction often far exceeds the recharge rate of these aquifers, leading to falls in groundwater levels. As the groundwater level drops, the patterns of discharge into rivers, lakes, and other freshwater environments also change, with potentially devastating consequences for these ecosystems. Inge de Graaf, University of Freiburg, Germany, and co-authors investigated the impact of groundwater pumping on groundwater discharge, identifying where environmentally critical streamflow reductions are already occurring and where they can be expected to occur in the future. They find that these environmental flow limits have already been reached in a substantial proportion of the world's watersheds in which pumping occurs (15–21% depending on the climate projections used), and that this number is expected to grow significantly by 2050 (estimates of 42–79%). With this illustration of the scope of the challenges ahead, the authors call for the integration of groundwater requirements into any future assessment of worldwide water sources. Seafood is the most rapidly expanding food production sector and has been proposed as having a key role in sustainable diets. Existing mechanisms to encourage sustainability in the industry have largely focused on governmental regulations, market-based approaches (eg, certification), and voluntary commitment by companies. The role of financial mechanisms has been speculated on but has so far remained understudied. Using a content analysis of two leading seafood-focused media outlets, qualitative examples, and descriptive statistics of shareholder analysis, Jean-Baptiste Jouffray from the Stockholm Resiliency Centre, Sweden, and colleagues aimed to identify key financial leverage points for encouraging sustainability in the seafood sector. These leverage points focus on mainstream financial mechanisms and can be divided into actions from three types: sustainability covenants on loans from banks, stock exchanges requiring certain environmental criteria be met for a company to be listed, and shareholder activism. While these mechanisms are, by their nature, restricted to larger businesses, they could exert a powerful influence and might also be relevant to other extractive industries. The urban heat island (UHI) effect is a well known consequence of urbanisation and the resulting replacement of natural environments with constructed ones. It can have serious consequences for human health, as elevated temperatures pose direct risk for conditions such as dehydration and heat stress, as well affecting existing disorders such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. With the continuing growth of the world's urban population and the diversity of these cities it is important to understand the which populations are most at risk. To this end, Tirthankar Chakraborty from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, USA, and colleagues conducted an analysis of 25 cities around the world, looking at the neighbourhood-level UHI effect and income to identify socioeconomic disparities. The results differed with city characteristics, but the majority (18 [72%] cities) had UHI effects that disproportionately affected people on lower incomes, and these effects were closely correlated with indices of urbanicity and greenness. The authors' findings suggest that city-specific measures will be needed to tackle the issue of UHIs, and that doing so could be one way to tackle the issue of health inequalities within cities. Fires in Indonesia are a major source of particulate matter pollution both within the country and in neighbouring countries in equatorial Asia. Furthermore, they represent a significant contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, with fires in 2015 releasing an amount of CO2 equivalent to the yearly fossil fuel combustion of India or Japan. These fires are mainly from land clearance for cultivation or wildfires during drought periods, which are exacerbated by the drainage of carbon-rich peatlands. Miriam Marlier from the RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, USA, and co-authors created a decision-support tool to estimate the magnitude of fire emissions over the coming decades, their public health impacts, and the gains that could be made with various land management approaches. They report that the PM2·5 released by these fires would be responsible for an average of 36 000 excess deaths per year across Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, and that the majority (>60%) of these emissions were the result of fires on peatlands. The study highlights the importance of policies to block fires in peatlands, which the authors predict could prevent two-thirds of these excess deaths.

    "ab": "The last 22 years contain 20 of the warmest (global average) years on record. This trend is powerfully demonstrated by the popular #Showyourstripes initiative. That most of the warmest years have occurred very recently is hardly surprising given that our planet is being heated by increasing amounts of heat trapping CO2 in the atmosphere—primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels. In this context 2019, which has seen a number of record-breaking heatwaves, is displaying exactly the sorts of conditions that we should expect to see more and more often. Indeed, the trend is now so clear that it almost seems mundane to talk about temperature records being broken again, as climate vlogger Adam Levy (@ClimateAdam) put it “it's hard to talk about all this constant record breaking without sounding like a broken record”. In January persistent high-pressure in the Tasman Sea blocked cold fronts and cooler air, contributing to a prolonged heatwave across much of Australia with many records being broken. Temperatures peaked at 49·1°C (120°F) at Marble Bar in northwestern Australia and extreme temperatures persisted over much of the country for several weeks. Combined with severe drought, the hot weather facilitated major wildfire outbreaks in the southeast of Australia. Heat took its toll on wildlife too with mass fish deaths and fruit bats falling dead from trees among the reported impacts. In May and early June, India and Pakistan experienced two pronounced heatwaves. Temperatures reached 48°C (118°F) in some areas and though reported deaths vary, it's clear that the numbers are in the high hundreds to over a thousand. Failure to maintain an adequate supply of electricity and water to prevent heat-related deaths and sickness lead to public protests in many regions. Clearly there is much room for improved heatwave planning before the next such event in the region. In late June Europe experienced an atmospheric pressure system, which allowed hot air from north Africa to travel up into Europe where it led to temperatures up to 10°C above normal for the month. Historical records at locations in France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Spain were all broken, with Spain experiencing its worst wildfires in 20 years in the sweltering dry conditions. A Comment in this issue provides some context for understanding if this is the new norm, how bad things might get, and whether heat planning has improved since the disastrous events of 2003. In addition to becoming “old news”, heatwaves have several other public relations problems. Press coverage of heatwaves tends to focus on images of sun bathers and people playing in fountains, thus failing to recognise the more dangerous and life-threatening side of extreme heat. Furthermore, although we know from historical heatwave events that the numbers of excess deaths—those beyond the normal level of mortality for a given period—are often high they can only be identified statistically as data becomes available following the event. Consequently, the deaths reported in the media tend to be the relatively small number of people who died from direct heat-related conditions. This can make heatwaves feel relatively unthreatening and even pleasant in much media coverage. Furthermore, as pointed out in a Correspondence in this issue, where the media covers ways to avoid the worst impacts of heat they focus on individual vulnerabilities and behaviours rather than on social factors like income, housing quality, social networks, and healthy workplaces. More balanced reporting of social factors would help cast the problem as one of public health and not just individual behaviours. It's not all bad news though, an Article in this issue indicates that there was a reduction in heat-related mortality, at least from cardiovascular disease, in Spain between 1980 and 2016, although this wasn't explicitly down to climate adaptation. Perhaps even more encouragingly heat wave plans in Europe developed after 2003 do seem to have increased preparedness, reducing the negative impacts of the heatwave, although that will not be fully clear for some months. These plans also benefited from accurate forecasts, the temperature record in France was forecast by Météo-France three days in advance. It is certain that we will experience more and more extreme heat events and there is plenty of room for improved planning to adapt to these changes and minimise their impacts, in addition to cutting the carbon emissions which are driving the problem.

The heatwave peaked over central and northern Europe, fuelled by a very persistent planetary-scale Rossby wave (giant meanders in upper-tropospheric winds), which turned into an omega block, so named because its shape resembles the Greek letter (Ω). This blocking event led to hot air from northern Africa being transferred to Europe (figure). Full-Text PDF Open AccessMisdiagnosing vulnerability to heatwaves in the mediaYet again we are faced with news about temperature records being broken. As regions, countries, cities, and individuals experience more frequent, intense, and extended heatwaves,1 people often turn to the media for advice on coping with what is already a substantial public health problem. For example, media coverage by television, radio, and newspapers has long been dominated by the medical model of health2 and its general advice on heat avoidance. This advice typically includes restricting physical activity, wearing loose and light-coloured clothing, drinking more water, cooling the body, and protecting against sunburn. Full-Text PDF Open AccessTrends in temperature-related age-specific and sex-specific mortality from cardiovascular diseases in Spain: a national time-series analysisIn Spain, the observed warming of the climate has occurred in parallel with substantial adaptation to both high and low temperatures. The reduction in the RR and the attributable fraction associated with heat would be compatible with an adaptive response specifically addressing the negative consequences of climate change. Nevertheless, the simultaneous reduction in the RR and attributable fraction of cold temperatures also highlights the importance of more general factors such as socioeconomic development, increased life expectancy and quality, and improved health-care services in the country.

    "ab": "The contributions that nature makes to humans depend on local social and ecological factors, but there is a lack of high-resolution data mapping the magnitude of these contributions at a global scale. Rebecca Chaplin-Kramer, from Natural Capital Project at Stanford University, and colleagues selected water quality regulation, coastal risk reduction, and crop pollination as examples of these natural contributions to investigate. They used modelling and open-source data to produce spatially explicit global estimates of these contributions and people's needs for them, and combined these with three diverse scenarios from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways to investigate possible future changes. The resulting estimates showed that, in many parts of the world where nature's contributions are the most beneficial to people, the ability of nature to provide them will decline, particularly in Africa and south Asia. Without sustainable development policies being enacted, billions of people will be put at risk of higher water pollution and lost crop production due to insufficient pollination. By mapping these natural contributions and people's needs for them, future locally appropriate policies can be designed to close the gaps between them. A large proportion of the species most at threat in the planet's ongoing biodiversity crisis are small arthropods. Land use has been indicated to be a key driver of arthropod biodiversity loss, but there have been few large scale studies into the specific elements responsible for this decline. Sebastian Seibold of the Terrestrial Ecology Research Group at the Technical University of Munich, and colleagues investigated changes in arthropod diversity and biomass across 150 grassland and 140 forest sites in Germany between 2008 and 2017 and how land use types affected these changes. They found declines in biomass and species diversity across grassland and forest sites, with additional reductions in abundance in grassland sites. Declines occurred at all trophic levels and in grasslands, the declines were greater in areas of increased arable land cover. These findings add to the argument that land use practices should be considered across the landscape rather than just the land being managed. Phasing out fossil fuels will be crucial to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, but policies to do so will need to be acceptable to the public to be effective. The phasing out of fossil fuel-powered cars presents a particular challenge given the scale of the effect this will have on people's daily lives. Adrian Rinscheid, from the Institute for Economy and the Environment of the University of St Gallen, and colleagues set out to identify what would be most publicly acceptable in policies to phase out fossil fuel-powered cars in the USA. They used a demographically representative sample of 1520 US residents who were asked to rate 24 320 hypothetical policy scenarios in a conjoint experiment to identify which characteristics made policies appealing. The policies identified as being most acceptable were those that took effect no later than 2030, used subsidies rather than taxes or bans, afforded greater (ie, >30%) reductions in pollution, and cost the least. Endorsement by trusted groups also improved acceptability, but depended on individual preferences (eg, political party affiliation). The authors make the case for early adoption of softer policy measures over more distant, but stronger options such as bans and taxes. Dietary risk factors are a major cause of non-communicable disease burden in India, including low fruit and vegetable consumption. While average fruit and vegetable consumption in India has previously been reported to be low compared with WHO-recommended levels (400 g/person/day), the key socioeconomic and demographic drivers of consumption remain unknown. Samira Choudhury, of the Centre for Development, Environment and Policy at SOAS University of London, and colleagues analysed data from a nationally representative survey of household consumption and expenditure in India for 2011–12. They found that median fruit and vegetable consumption was low at 200 g/person/day, with a highly unequal distribution. The only variables with a significant effect among the lowest percentiles of consumption were household income and belonging to socioeconomically disadvantaged castes or tribes. Although economic growth could potentially raise incomes, downstream policies that directly affect consumers, such as government provided fruit-and-vegetable-rich meals, could have more rapid effects and be more directly targeted at disadvantaged groups.

    "ab": "On August 2–7, the IPCC convened to approve a new report, Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. As the report outlines, the continuing growth of the world's population and wealth has so far depended heavily on the expansion of land use for forestry and agriculture, with more than 70% of the ice-free surface of the Earth now being directly affected by human activity. However, as land use intensifies, so too do the risks of land degradation, desertification, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, further enhancing these threats to food security and biodiversity. Central to understanding climate change is that land can be both a source and a sink of greenhouse gases: the net effect depends on the use this land is put to and the way that it is managed. CO2 sequestration by soils and vegetation, for example, act to reduce the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases, while methane emissions from rice cultivation and ruminant livestock rearing, and the conversion of excess nitrogen fertilisers to nitrogen oxides are contributors to the growth in atmospheric greenhouse gases. During 2007–16, land acted as a sink for an estimated 11·2 GtCO2 per year, or roughly 29% of total CO2 emissions, according to the report. However, whether the land can continue to sustain this sink is directly threatened by climate change. Together agriculture, forestry, and other land uses are estimated to produce the equivalent of 12·0 GtCO2 per year, or 23% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As such, land-based adaptation and mitigation responses are crucial to addressing climate change. Probably the most discussed of the responses included in the IPCC report are those related to food systems, particularly diets. Like previous reports on sustainable food systems, it discusses the potential benefits of populations adopting more varied and balanced diets incorporating more plant-based foods, as well as the use of more sustainable agricultural practices and strategies to reduce food waste. However, the report is not confined to food, and the authors present other possible mitigation and adaptation approaches across a range of settings, including sustainable forest management, direct interventions to prevent or reverse desertification, and conservation of high-carbon ecosystems such as peatlands. The problems facing the way we use land are closely interrelated, and consequently so are the solutions, with most options having many potential co-benefits. For example, approaches aiming to restore degraded land could also enhance its ability to act as a carbon sink, as well as provide benefits to local biodiversity and/or food security. While land-based mitigation will be essential to keeping the global temperature increase below 1·5°C, or even 2°C, there are limits to what this can achieve. As well as the clear logistical and financial challenges involved, there are also huge cultural ones, such as those involving dietary change. Land ownership and access is another thorny issue; in many of the most vulnerable communities, the people working the land and most exposed to the effects of degradation and climate change are not recognised as land owners. Without secure land tenure, it is difficult to implement any long-term plans to enhance sustainability, but any solutions involving land ownership reform will require significant political will behind them. The intrinsically finite area of land available for mitigation, food production, wildlife, cities and almost everything else we do is also a key challenge. Large-scale conversion of land for purposes such as afforestation and reforestation—and especially growth of crops for bioenergy—need to be implemented carefully to avoid creating new risks for land degradation and food security, among other problems. Despite the challenges There is much that must be accomplished through careful land use and management. The IPCC report makes it clear that two of the most important prerequisites for achieving meaningful change will be having a clear climate target and identifying which combinations of solutions nations are willing to implement. The Paris Agreement largely addresses the former, whereas the latter will need discussion and implementation in the imminent future. What is certain is that change is needed, and it is needed soon. With the close links between land and climate, deferring action is only going to make these challenges steeper.",

    "ab": "Looking back over 2019 through a planetary health lens, the key themes of the year might be emerging public awareness and advocacy, and inadequate practical action. The rhetoric around climate change has notably changed with “climate emergency” and “climate breakdown” and “public health emergency” being increasingly used to describe the various climate challenges we are inflicting upon ourselves. In Iceland, a plaque commemorating the former Okjökull glacier—the first officially lost to the climate crisis—displays text that perfectly captures the climate zeitgeist: “This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.” The value and potential for youth leadership has also emerged as a key theme over the last year, while the IPBES global assessment report also brought home the true severity of the biodiversity crisis that we are facing. Meanwhile, many of the sustainable development goals are looking increasingly far from being achievable by 2030, with some even worsening. These are not disparate unconnected problems, but are all maladies of our current socioeconomic system; the net effect is far from what we could reasonably describe as a state of planetary health. In the last 70 years we have radically changed both our lives and the world around us. This has benefited many people, but the environmental cost has been enormous, such that our current course is simply unsustainable even if it were ideal. And clearly for many, indeed most people, it is far from ideal. The health implications of unchecked climate heating are also becoming increasingly clear as laid out in the latest Lancet Countdown report. “A business as usual trajectory will result in a fundamentally altered world… the life of every child born today will be profoundly affected.” At the time of writing, political leaders and climate diplomats are meeting in Madrid for the UN Climate Change Conference (COP25). It is hoped that countries will ramp up their decarbonisation pledges during 2020 prior to the critical meeting next year in Glasgow. So far, the negotiations in Madrid have been dominated by conflict over the “Article 6” rules, for international cooperation, especially carbon markets, and how to support countries that have been irreversibly harmed by climate change—known as loss and damage. These are important components of the Paris Agreement that need to be nailed down, but given that emissions are still rising it's hard not to wonder if this is going to be enough. So, what's the block? Why is so little actually happening to change anything? This is the question so many young people are angrily asking. The Paris Agreement introduced a system of voluntary mitigation pledges over the old top-down approach of strict emissions limits, although these limits do still exist aspirationally. It has been argued that this voluntary approach resulted in a process that no longer focussed on what is environmentally desirable, but rather on what is politically feasible. Such an approach seems to have been largely effective in overcoming diplomatic gridlock, but it is vulnerable to a growing inconsistency between talk, policy, and action. Perhaps because of the need for politically expedience, policies to date have focused on enabling rapid deployment of renewable energy, with some notable success, but with few parallel policies designed to actively phase out fossil fuel technologies. Arguably, without a much stronger focus on directly cutting the use, or at least emissions from, fossil fuels, carbon emissions are likely to continue to grow in parallel with clean energy capacity. It's easy to see that policies designed to directly limit or reduce fossil fuel use will be politically contested far more than those designed to promote relatively clean technologies, so perhaps we haven't really sidestepped the tough negotiations but simply kicked them down the road once more. We have focused primarily on the climate emergency here given the ongoing COP25 conference and the importance of climate stability to all other endeavours, but issues of human development and protection of nature are no less important or crosscutting. As we move increasingly from only providing evidence of the nature of the problems we face to also prioritising and implementing solutions, we need to embrace the inherently political nature of those choices. As has been identified in climate change adaptation, these choices need to be understood as sociopolitical processes rather than politically neutral managerial decisions. If we cannot take that step, then the gap between talk and action is likely to continue to confound us.",

First, Mátyás commented that our study was not “the first of its kind” and corroborated this statement with a reference to Nutsford and colleague's 2016 retrospective study.2Nutsford D Pearson AL Kingham S Reitsma F Residential exposure to visible blue space (but not green space) associated with lower psychological distress in a capital city.Health Place. 2016; 39: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar After careful deliberation, we concluded that his observation is only partly valid because, as he correctly states in their Correspondence, Nutsford and colleague's study correlates blue space with psychological stress, but not with suicide mortality. We acknowledge, as we do in the Article, that evidence about the potential salutogenic effects of blue space on mental health is mounting. However, we stress that whether this evidence applies to suicide mortality, remains an open question. Second, Mátyás queries the absence from our models of psychological wellbeing. His observation is correct and, as in any ecological study with official statistics, the difficulty is that such important personal level variables are often absent. Indeed, as a result of such limitations, we did not attempt to draw final conclusions on these matters, although we did raise them as topics for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms. We declare no competing interests. This research received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement number 714993). Natural environments and suicide mortality in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional, ecological studyOur findings support the notion that exposure to natural environments, particularly to greenery, might have a role in reducing suicide mortality.

One of their findings contradicted their hypothesis, which stated that coastal proximity is negatively associated with suicide mortality. When discussing their study, the authors found that blue space visibility did not necessarily correlate with mental health. Then, however, they add that they believe their study is the first of its kind, so they are not sure whether their findings are specific to their case study. This study is very valuable and comprehensive. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that there was a retrospective study published 2 years earlier by Nutsford and colleagues2Nutsford D Pearson AL Kingham S Reitsma F Residential exposure to visible blue space (but not green space) associated with lower psychological distress in a capital city.Health Place. 2016; 39: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar who found that a higher visibility of blue space is associated with lower psychological distress. Helbich and colleagues' analyses were based on the officially registered suicide deaths per municipality for the period 2005–14 in the Netherlands. Considering that suicide mortality was studied in Helbich and colleagues' study, and not other factors that correlate with psychological wellbeing (such as percieved self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, intergenerational dependence, and self-actualisation)3WHOThe world health report 2001. Mental health: new understanding, new hope. World Health Organization, Geneva2001Google Scholar, the authors' statement should be refined to something like “Our finding is that blue space is not necessarily associated with suicide mortality”. With this minor correction, the apparent contradiction could be dispelled because suicide mortality was the only factor analysed, and other factors contributing to overall wellbeing (such as those previously mentioned) were not analysed. Conversely, modelling of data is one of the most important means of drawing conclusions from analyses. Helbich and colleagues' analyses is a well-structured and seemingly reliable. Furthermore, to aid the reader's understanding of the present study's findings, it is important to draw attention to positive findings from other (previously published) studies that have explored a similar hypothesis. I declare no competing interests.

    "ab": "We thank Thomas Longden for his Correspondence, in which he offers insightful comments on some publications from our research team on temperature-related mortality projections under climate change scenarios.1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e367Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 2Vicedo-Cabrera AM Guo Y Sera F et al.Temperature-related mortality impacts under and beyond Paris Agreement climate change scenarios.Clim Change. 2018; 150: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar His letter provides us with the opportunity to discuss some aspects in more detail, and to clarify specific debated issues. The focus of Longden's Correspondence is on the projected temperature-related impacts for Australia under different climate change scenarios, found in our analyses, which show a different pattern when compared with those in other regions of the world, specifically a net decrease in temperature-related mortality. This difference can be explained by a projected decrease in cold-related deaths that is higher than the increase in heat-related mortality. However, providing a context for correctly interpreting such findings is important. First, some estimates are quite uncertain, and the relatively wide confidence intervals include ranges that are in fact compatible with a net increase (see for instance the right-bottom panel of figure 3 in our Article).1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e367Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar Second, as shown in the same graph and in figures 1 and 2 in Vicedo-Cabrera and colleagues' publication,2Vicedo-Cabrera AM Guo Y Sera F et al.Temperature-related mortality impacts under and beyond Paris Agreement climate change scenarios.Clim Change. 2018; 150: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar the net change is stronger for milder climate change scenarios, whereas the pattern reverses and the net change is less clear for more extreme warming. Finally, and most importantly, both publications define such scenarios as global temperature trajectories or changes, but they explicitly state that in all of these scenarios, Australia is projected to experience a milder temperature increase if compared with the other regions assessed in these investigations (see table 2 and the figure in the appendix [p 12] of our Article).1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e367Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar Longden then reports results from an article he authored, in which an alternative method based on endogenously determined thresholds was used to estimate cold-related and heat-related deaths in five Australian cities.3Longden T Measuring temperature-related mortality using endogenously determined thresholds.Clim Change. 2018; 150: 343-375Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar We value the comparison with other approaches; however, we would like to point out that the analytical framework we applied is the result of an intense methodological development for environmental epidemiological studies that has occurred in the past two decades,4Schwartz J Spix C Touloumi G et al.Methodological issues in studies of air pollution and daily counts of deaths or hospital admissions.J Epidemiol Community Health. 1996; 50: S3-S11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Dominici F Samet JM Zeger SL Combining evidence on air pollution and daily mortality from the 20 largest US cities: a hierarchical modelling strategy.J R Stat Soc Ser A Stat Soc. 2000; 163: 263-302Crossref Google Scholar providing study designs and statistical techniques validated in simulation studies6Peng RD Dominici F Louis TA Model choice in time series studies of air pollution and mortality.J R Stat Soc Ser A Stat Soc. 2006; 169: 179-203Crossref Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 7Gasparrini A Modelling lagged associations in environmental time series data: a simulation study.Epidemiology. 2016; 27: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and used in hundreds of publications.8Basu R High ambient temperature and mortality: a review of epidemiological studies from 2001 to 2008.Environ Health. 2009; 8: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar The results cannot be easily dismissed with a comparison with a newly developed and relatively untested method. Further research and a critical review of the various approaches is needed. In the first part of his letter, Longden also discusses specific results relating to the shapes of the exposure–response curves and the minimum mortality temperature. Regarding the curves, he states how in his cited analysis the temperature–mortality association resembles a J-shaped curve,4Schwartz J Spix C Touloumi G et al.Methodological issues in studies of air pollution and daily counts of deaths or hospital admissions.J Epidemiol Community Health. 1996; 50: S3-S11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar more than a U-shaped curve as in a previous Article published in 2015 by our research team.9Gasparrini A Guo Y Hashizume M et al.Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: a multicountry observational study.Lancet. 2015; 386: 369-375Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar This J-curve association implies a higher risk and excess mortality associated with heat compared with cold. Longden supported his statement by citing five articles. However, we would like to point out that three of these articles involve locations in tropical areas of Vietnam, Kenya, and China, which are not climatologically similar to the three main Australian cities included in our analysis (Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane). The other two articles are multilocation analyses reporting results for US cities, in which the estimated curves look more like an inverse J shape (see for instance figure S8 in the cited study by Lee and colleagues10Lee W Kim H Hwang S Zanobetti A Schwartz JD Chung Y Monte Carlo simulation-based estimation for the minimum mortality temperature in temperature-mortality association study.BMC Med Res Methodol. 2017; 17: 137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These associations, characterised by a high minimum mortality temperature and a high number of cold-related deaths, are consistent with what we previously found.9Gasparrini A Guo Y Hashizume M et al.Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: a multicountry observational study.Lancet. 2015; 386: 369-375Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar Regarding the minimum mortality temperature, we reported the estimate of 22·4°C for Melbourne (see the table in the appendix [pp 7–15] of the 2015 Article),9Gasparrini A Guo Y Hashizume M et al.Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: a multicountry observational study.Lancet. 2015; 386: 369-375Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar but we stress how this value is not uncommon across the other 381 cities included in the analysis, especially those in relatively warm climates. This minimum mortality temperature is higher than the average annual temperature of 18·1°C for Australia (table 1 in the 2015 Article),9Gasparrini A Guo Y Hashizume M et al.Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: a multicountry observational study.Lancet. 2015; 386: 369-375Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar but also for all the other cities or countries, consistent with findings from other research groups; for instance, the two multicity studies cited in Longden's Correspondence. In conclusion, we welcome the assessment that Longden has provided on our Article, and we agree that further analyses and comparison with alternative approaches are warranted to complement the evidence on potential health effects of climate change in Australia and other regions of the world. Both authors report a grant from the UK Medical Research Council (MR/M022625/1) and a grant from the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NE/R009384/1). Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenariosThis study shows the negative health impacts of climate change that, under high-emission scenarios, would disproportionately affect warmer and poorer regions of the world. Comparison with lower emission scenarios emphasises the importance of mitigation policies for limiting global warming and reducing the associated health risks. Full-Text PDF Open AccessTemperature-related mortality and climate change in AustraliaTemperature-related mortality is one of the main measures used to assess the costs and benefits associated with climate change. Some assessments have found a net benefit of climate change due to reduced cold temperature deaths offsetting increases in heat-related deaths.1–3 Antonio Gasparrini and colleagues1 and Vicedo-Cabrera and colleagues3 found a net benefit of climate change for Australia, a surprising outcome given that other regions that experience cooler weather were associated with a net cost of climate change.

    "ab": "Now in her 60s, Mrs PE hauls around a metal oxygen tank. She is the victim of a slow, debilitating process that began decades earlier with fast food consumption, physical inactivity, and cigarette smoking. Although she felt fine, over time she steadily gained weight and her cholesterol levels crept up. By the time these subtle warning signs became apparent, the damage to her vital organs was irreversible. This woman might help save our planet. That is because Mrs PE is actually a metaphor for Mrs Patient Earth—our plastic-clogged waterways are her cholesterol build-up, our global warming crisis is her silent rise in blood pressure, and our coal overdependence is her food overconsumption. These are the chronic stressors on Earth's vital organs. Metaphors like the aforementioned one are perhaps our most precious currency in this crusade for a sustainable planet, because the modern technological era now demands more than ever that effective risk communication be relatable, memorable, and succinct. Indeed, this ongoing failure in risk communication is the most serious threat to the environmental movement. Dr John Sterman, a leading scientist on climate change from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, highlights that “strong scientific consensus on the causes and risks of climate change stands in stark contrast to widespread confusion and complacency among the public”,1Sterman JD Risk communication on climate: mental models and mass balance.Science. 2008; 322: 532-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar and ineffective risk communication is now the “major bottleneck preventing science from playing an appropriate role in climate policy.”2Sterman JD Communicating climate change risks in a skeptical world.Clim Change. 2011; 108: 811Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar Researchers are now actively working on this pressing communication problem, including at the University of California Climate Lab, the Yale Climate Change Communication programme, and the Climate Outreach programme. Yet, more work needs to be done. So, if the science is clear yet the communication unclear, how do we save Patient Earth? As doctors, we learn how to communicate risk throughout our careers. Every day we are charged with the responsibility to explain complex and preventable conditions with distant consequences, much akin to environmental risks, such that patients can immediately understand their situation and make actionable changes themselves. First, we've learned that risk communication is a trainable skill. In fact, a major study showed that communication training for doctors improves patient adherence by more than 10% for treatments such as medications, diet improvements, increased exercise, and cancer screening—behaviours with high stakes yet distant outcomes.3Zolnierek KBH DiMatteo MR Physician communication and patient adherence to treatment: a meta-analysis.Med Care. 2009; 47: 826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar Indeed, in medical school, the practice of working with hired patient actors and then reviewing our interactions with clinical mentors is considered an essential training tool. We quickly learn which risk communication techniques motivate behaviour change and which do not. For example, in trying to connect today's sugar-loaded diet to an increased risk of diabetes, the vividness of a surgical limb amputation resonates more powerfully than the vague future risk of diabetes itself. This skill is both teachable and fundamental to the work of both doctors and environmental scientists alike. Second, we have realised the striking effect of risk communication during moments of crisis. One large longitudinal survey found that patients with a new diagnosis of stroke, cancer, lung disease, heart disease, or diabetes were three times more likely to quit smoking than the average smoker.4Keenan PS Smoking and weight change after new health diagnoses in older adults.Arch Intern Med. 2009; 169: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar Numerous studies since then have confirmed that new diagnoses, especially of serious medical conditions, represent teachable moments for risk-factor modification. Perhaps, environmentalists too could initiate timely, highly-focused campaigns surrounding important natural disasters. For example, this strategy might have substantially magnified risk communication (and perhaps even changed human behaviour) following the destructive California wildfires that cost more than US$3·5 billion or the record-setting US mid-west freeze that killed 21 people. Third, we tap into the power of figurative language to shed light on risk and complexity and motivate crucial behaviors. One of us faced this dilemma on a medical trip to Malawi, Africa—how do you get a 7-year-old boy with HIV to take life-saving medications every day of his life? By sharing with him that taking his (antiretroviral) medications gives the soldiers in his body the vitamins they need to fight disease and keep him strong. A study substantiated our personal experience, showing that when explaining cancer treatments, patients appreciated the use of metaphors such as traffic jam and bus driver, instead of exon specificity and driver mutation.5Pinheiro AP Pocock RH Dixon MD Shaib WL Ramalingam SS Pentz RD Using metaphors to explain molecular testing to cancer patients.Oncologist. 2017; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar By creating simplified mental models (such as in the case of Patient Earth), metaphors might represent a potent cure to the problem of risk communication. We live in a time when the battle is often over tweets and truth, in which human attention span is measured in milliseconds, and in which viral and instafamous are status symbols. This reality is ours. Thus, our tactics should be tailored to the 280 character limit of our lives. In a world in which our greatest enemy is the mischaracterisation of truth by a single tweet, the metaphor further lends itself to battle in this medium. After nearly 50 years of policy advancement since the first Earth Day in 1970, our planet is now under unprecedented assault. Although US policies are not the only contributor, we are far from leading the charge in the right direction. In just the past 2 years alone, our nation has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, proposed reversal in fuel efficiency standards, and recommended budget cuts to renewable energy research and climate change initiatives.6Greshko M Parker L Howard BC A running list of how trump is changing the environment.https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/03/how-trump-is-changing-science-environmentDate accessed: April 8, 2019Google Scholar Progressive causes have long struggled with their inability to overcome academic tendencies and abstract policy prescriptions, failing to galvanise widespread public action. This is especially true for issues with far-removed consequences, such as climate change and chronic disease risks. Current events remind us all of our shared purpose to protect and preserve the health of our planet. We should reflect, refine, and reclaim the techniques and tactics we use to serve this purpose. Ultimately, Earth's health might depend on a simple metaphor. We declare no competing interests.",

However, such compromises are normal and healthy in pragmatic assessments of effectiveness under realistic programmatic conditions, rather than efficacy under artificially controlled experimental conditions. As acknowledged in the discussion and emphasised in the title, we also agree that evidence for window screening impact is purely observational, and that long-overdue, cluster-randomised, experimentally controlled analyses of well developed delivery practices for both these supplementary vector control measures are urgently needed.1Killeen GF Govella NJ Mlacha YP Chaki PP Suppression of malaria vector densities and human infection prevalence associated with scale-up of mosquito-proofed housing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: re-analysis of an observational series of parasitological and entomological surveys.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e132-e143Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar However, we disagree with the view that our attributions of intervention effects are haphazard and that potential confounders were “arbitrarily disregarded”.

Together, these two intervention scale-ups were associated with prevalence reductions equivalent to those accounted for with a simple, unattributed empirical time trend.1Killeen GF Govella NJ Mlacha YP Chaki PP Suppression of malaria vector densities and human infection prevalence associated with scale-up of mosquito-proofed housing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: re-analysis of an observational series of parasitological and entomological surveys.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e132-e143Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar As detailed in the methods, we did account for temporal autocorrelation when fitting these models.1Killeen GF Govella NJ Mlacha YP Chaki PP Suppression of malaria vector densities and human infection prevalence associated with scale-up of mosquito-proofed housing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: re-analysis of an observational series of parasitological and entomological surveys.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e132-e143Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar Indeed, our models that included a simple empirical time trend as per previous studies5Lawson AB Carroll R Castro M Joint spatial Bayesian modeling for studies combining longitudinal and cross-sectional data.Stat Methods Med Res. 2014; 23: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 6Maheu-Giroux M Castro MC Impact of community-based larviciding on the prevalence of malaria infection in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e71638Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar essentially reproduced the previous results, notably the modest effect size estimates for larviciding. The major issue therefore seems to be that fitting an unattributed empirical time trend may have spuriously assimilated the effects of both observed intervention scale-up processes.1Killeen GF Govella NJ Mlacha YP Chaki PP Suppression of malaria vector densities and human infection prevalence associated with scale-up of mosquito-proofed housing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: re-analysis of an observational series of parasitological and entomological surveys.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e132-e143Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar Underestimating effect sizes may be as dangerous as overestimating them, and regression dilution bias inherently exacerbates risk of underestimation. Notably, the entomological secondary outcomes and explanatory variables clearly and independently implicated window screening as the most important, obvious, and parsimonious explanation for the remarkable decline in malaria prevalence.1Killeen GF Govella NJ Mlacha YP Chaki PP Suppression of malaria vector densities and human infection prevalence associated with scale-up of mosquito-proofed housing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: re-analysis of an observational series of parasitological and entomological surveys.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e132-e143Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar Substantial reductions of mosquito population density were associated with scale-up of both larviciding and window screens. Effect sizes for different taxonomic groups of mosquitoes were fully consistent with those attributed to the same two interventions for the epidemiological data. Crucially, the effect sizes for window screening were greatest for the most efficient malaria vectors with the greatest preference for human hosts, and therefore the greatest dependence upon accessing human blood. It is difficult to envision how changes in demography, socioeconomic status, or any intervention other than a personal protection measure like window screens could cause such behaviour-dependent effects on mosquito populations.

Suppression of malaria vector densities and human infection prevalence associated with scale-up of mosquito-proofed housing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: re-analysis of an observational series of parasitological and entomological surveysCommunity-wide mosquito proofing of houses might deliver greater impacts on vector populations and malaria transmission than previously thought. The spontaneous nature of the scale-up observed here is also encouraging with regards to practicality, acceptability, and affordability in low-income settings. Full-Text PDF Open AccessAttribution of reductions in malaria prevalence in Dar es Salaam, TanzaniaDar es Salaam's Urban Malaria Control Project (UMCP) was launched in 2004 with the objective of implementing and assessing a microbial larviciding intervention. From 2004 to 2008, malaria prevalence decreased from 28% to less than 2%.1 This collapse of malaria vector populations was also observed in neighbouring regions of Tanzania.2 Part of the reduction preceded the initiation of larviciding activities and the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapies. Yet, previous analyses suggested that larviciding was effective in reducing malaria prevalence. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "BackgroundLand-use changes, such as deforestation, can increase the transmission potential of a landscape by increasing the abundance of preferred microhabitats for malaria vectors. However, this relationship between malaria and deforestation is complex and depends on factors such as the type of land use, the local ecology of malaria vector species, and the health resources available to the human population. In Madagascar, despite alarmingly high rates of deforestation and concerning reports of increases in malaria, this link remains poorly studied.MethodsThe feasibility of traditional approaches to studying the link between malaria and deforestation is limited for Madagascar because (i) health systems lack capacity to collect regular and accurate malaria data, especially in many rural areas, (ii) vector habitat preferences are poorly understood, and (iii) most existing malaria infection outcome datasets lack data on important mediating factors. To circumvent inadequacies in current data streams, we discuss a new framework that integrates novel primary data collection efforts on malaria infection and vector ecology from cross-sectional studies with longitudinal land-use data from remote sensing. Incorporating these data into hierarchical models allows us to infer structural associations between macro and micro level predictors of malaria risk in different ecological contexts in Madagascar. We compare the outputs from these models to analyses that can be conducted with robust data from the Brazilian health system.FindingsWe report data on malaria burden, deforestation, its covariates, and vector larval habitat preference for four distinct, previously understudied, ecoregions of Madagascar. Risk factors of malaria infection vary in sign and magnitude of effect across ecological contexts.InterpretationWhile data such as Brazil's allow for predictive modelling and assessment of temporally dynamic systems, our proposed modelling framework demonstrates variations in risk factors regionally in the meantime. This approach can help to mitigate current data gaps and better inform existing malaria control efforts in Madagascar during health system development.FundingThe Ren Che Foundation, Henry David Thoreau Foundation, Catholic Relief Services through a grand from United States Agency for International Development, and Madagascar Health and Environmental Research (MAHERY).",

    "ab": "Society must increase food production and restore vital ecosystem services or suffer unacceptable consequences. Unfortunately, conventional agriculture might be the single greatest threat to ecosystem function. At the same time, reducing ecologically harmful agricultural inputs or restoring farmlands to native ecosystems threatens food production. We fell into this predicament because we designed agricultural and economic systems that failed to account for ecosystem services, and the path forward requires redesigning both systems. Agroecology—which applies ecological principles to design sustainable farming methods that can increase food production, wean us away from non-renewable and harmful agricultural inputs, and restore ecosystem services—promises to be an appropriate redesign of agricultural systems. In Santa Rosa de Lima (Santa Catarina, Brazil), we are working with small family farmers, local and state government, and non-government organisations to develop multifunction riparian forests (MultRF) and High biodiversity silvopastoral systems (SPSnuclei) that achieve these goals, as well as the policies required for the adoption and dissemination. Appropriate policies must recognise that agricultural land can be managed for multiple ecosystem services, some of which directly benefit the farmer and market production, while others flow to society as a whole at different spatial levels, and hence are public goods. Ongoing research suggests that MultRFs and SPSnuclei can generate crucial ecosystem services like controlling blackflies, but incur initial investments. Farmers cannot be expected to prioritise the needs of society over those of their family, even when the former is socially optimal. This paper describes a pilot project for payments for ecosystem services for an agroecology scheme in Santa Rosa de Lima Southern Brazil, designed as participatory action research by the Silvopastoral and Ecological Restoration Lab (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina) to address these challenges.

    "ab": "BackgroundThe rapid nutrition transition China is now ongoing; the so-called westernisation of diets has been negatively affecting both human health and that of the environment. Against this backdrop, the Chinese government released new Dietary Guidelines (CDG) in 2016 and has been actively promoting them since. Our research makes use of quantitative modelling and aims to determine whether adjusting the average Chinese diet, so that it fulfils dietary requirements, could lead to nutritional and environmental co-benefits. Moreover, we want to determine the maximum reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) that could be achieved while simultaneously consuming a healthy diet.MethodsA diet optimisation model is used to simulate, quantify and compare the effects on the consumption of 19 food groups, and associated levels of GHGEs, resulting from two different scenarios: consumers complying with either the CDG or the WHO dietary norms. Subsequent simulations set maximum emission limits for the optimised diets and progressively reduce emissions by 5%. Four waves of consumption and price survey data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey are used in the analysis, while LCA estimates of GHGEs are compiled from the appropriate literature.FindingsPreliminary results show that outcomes under the two scenarios differ significantly, both nutritionally and in terms of GHGEs. Adopting the CDG would lead to a considerable intensification of emissions for both men and women, while adhering to the WHO norms would marginally increase emissions for women and slightly decrease emissions for men. However, we find a 10% reduction in GHGEs relative to current levels could be achieved, under both scenarios, through healthy and realistic dietary change. The maximum decrease in emissions achievable in the CDG model is 15%. The WHO models with a more drastic decrease in emissions (30% and 40%) involve major dietary change and lead to less balanced and varied diets compared with existing ones.InterpretationOur quantitative estimates show the potential for dietary guidelines to lead to environmental and health co-benefits, but only if they are specifically formulated to include environmental considerations. Achieving a major reduction in GHGEs through diets involves clear trade-offs between nutritional and environmental considerations.FundingNone.",

    "ab": "BackgroundIn 2017, the World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) officially stated \"[it is] imperative that planetary health be included in the core curriculum of medical schools, family medicine residencies and further professional development\". In 2019 WONCA urged \"family doctors around the world to commit to acting on planetary health\". Despite positive repercussions from major medical journals, the integration of planetary health into medical education remains a challenge. In this context it seems relevant to search for and develop tools to facilitate planetary health medical teaching. We aimed to apply actor-network theory (ANT) to describe interconnections between a patient with a clinical problem and planetary health proximal and distal issues.MethodsUsing ANT anthropological methodology, we describe the human and non-human actors involved in the interdependent network around the visit of a patient with obesity, hypertension, and diabetes to a community health clinic in southern Brazil. Perceived relevant proximal and distal planetary health issues involved in the clinical case were described, then organised into one diagram. This ANT clinical case diagram was subsequently used as a teaching tool.FindingsThis ANT clinical case diagram was presented to medical students and other health professionals in a few conferences and lectures in Brazil during the second semester of 2018 and initial months of 2019. Informal feedback from students and peers has been positive so far. The ANT diagram seemed to significantly facilitate comprehension of the planetary health framework to address clinical issues.InterpretationANT methodology could potentially be used in different clinical cases in diverse scenarios. Further formal quantitative and qualitative assessment of the utility of this teaching tool is required.FundingNone.",

    "ab": "BackgroundThe Revitalizing Informal Settlements and their Environments (RISE) programme aims to assess the health, wellbeing, and ecological impacts of a water-sensitive-cities approach to improving urban informal settlements. Incorporating water-cycle management and green technology sanitation strategies, we aim to reduce flood risk and improve sanitation and waste water treatment leading to cleaner and healthier environments. Here we present the initial design pre-intervention for evaluation in the first 12 settlements in Makassar, Indonesia.MethodsInitial environmental, and wellbeing and human health assessments were implemented starting in October, 2018, in 12 settlements in Makassar, Indonesia. Ecological assessments include measuring of temperature and humidity via iButtons installed in select homes, recording of bio-acoustic to measure biodiversity within settlement boundaries, and trapping disease vectors quarterly. Implemented evaluation of environmental contamination includes sampling water and soil sources for total coliforms as well as collecting soil via bootsocks by walking predefined transects. Human assessment includes an annual baseline survey of all settlement households, assessing self-reported symptoms, health-care system utilisation, and subjective wellbeing. Additionally, children younger than 5 years are surveyed quarterly for caregiver reported symptoms of diarrhoea and febrile illness, blood samples and anthropometry are being collected annually, and faeces samples are requested quarterly.FindingsEcological assessments have provided more than a million temperature data points. 21 000 mosquitos have been captured and identified. A total of 114 water samples, 84 bootsocks, and 91 soil samples have been collected, with sampling prior to and during the wet season. We have identified over 600 households within the 12 settlements. Health assessments of children under the age of 5 years have revealed 282 children with collection of 234 faeces samples and 188 blood samples.InterpretationWe have successfully implemented baseline ecological and human health and wellbeing assessment tools in all 12 settlements, which will allow for the evaluation of water-sensitive-cities approach in RISE programme.FundingThe Wellcome Trust (Our Planet, Our Health grant 205222/Z/16/Z).",

    "ab": "BackgroundModernised farming has contributed significantly to the increased global food supply over the past half-century, albeit while creating severe threats to the environment. Excessive application of chemical fertiliser has in particular led to massive release of reactive nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, where they become major components of fine particulate matter (PM2·5) pollution, with detrimental effects on human health. Various sustainable farming methods with lower environmental impacts have been experimented with and practised in many countries, but their wider benefits beyond the farm scale have rarely been examined. One such method is intercropping with soybeans, which takes advantage of the nitrogen fixing ability of soybeans to improve nutrient use efficiency and reduce fertiliser use.MethodsWe developed a computational modelling framework using the GEOS-Chem and DNDC models, revising the representation for soil nitrogen processes and crop-crop interaction. We did model experiments to quantify the benefits of nationwide adoption of maize-soybean intercropping systems in China in terms of gains in crop production, decreases in fertiliser consumption, and reductions in ammonia (NH3) emissions. We further examined how the decline in NH3 emissions could reduce the downwind formation of PM2·5 and the associated public health costs.FindingsAnnual mean PM2·5 concentrations can be reduced by up to 1·5 μg/m3 with the nationwide adoption of maize-soybean intercropping, with a corresponding annual net economic benefit of US$67 billion, of which $13 billion arises from saved health costs from reduced air pollution.InterpretationOur study shows the wider economic and environmental value of intercropping systems for promoting both food security and public health, serving as a basis for policy consideration by governments and stakeholders. The same modelling framework can likewise be used to investigate the large-scale impacts of other sustainable farming methods.FundingGeneral Research Fund the Hong Kong Research Grants Council, the Area of Excellence Scheme, and the CUHK Vice- Chancellor Discretionary Fund.",

    "ab": "BackgroundCommunities around the Lake Victoria Basin experience many challenges, including dependence on dwindling natural resources for survival, pervasive poverty, food insecurity, poor reproductive health outcomes, and inaccessible health services. The Basin faces rapid population growth, substantial degradation, drought, dwindling biodiversity, and failing fisheries. Health of People and the Environment in the Lake Victoria Basin (HoPE-LVB) is an integrated population, health, and the environment (PHE) project in Kenya and Uganda that aims to reduce ecosystem degradation in the Lake Victoria Basin, while increasing access to essential public health services in project communities, through promotion of multisectoral collaboration.MethodsProject staff conducted an internal evaluation of the project using secondary analysis of service statistics, a quantitative household survey, a self-administered questionnaire with health-care providers, focus group discussions with community members, and key informant interviews with community members and policy makers in the project areas.FindingsDocumented key results were also confirmed by a separate USAID-commissioned external evaluation. Apart from outputs such as trees planted, energy-saving stoves constructed, community members reached with PHE messages, and illegal fishing nets seized, we found communities spoke about \"hope for a brighter future\", and the feelings of more control over their lives. More women delivered at health facilities, reducing the risks associated with home births, which was made possible by training of health workers. There was increased use of more effective contraceptive methods for families to achieve their desired family sizes. More than 1583 households became peer education sites to demonstrate hygiene and resource management behaviours. 44 beach management units that govern community fisheries were strengthened to demarcate protected breeding sites and enforce local fisheries bylaws. Due in part to the results of this project, the East African Community has developed a regional PHE Strategic Plan to guide member states to implement PHE measures across the Basin.InterpretationThe project impacted gender relations, and community health and natural resource use behaviours. It increased women's participation in natural and financial resource management decisions and livelihood opportunities. Overall health-seeking behaviours improved and more women stated they could access contraception with support of their spouses. The project strengthened the governance and protection mechanisms around fishing, and affected the terrestrial ecosystem through tree planting efforts. The integrated and holistic nature of the HoPE-LVB project contributed to marked improvements in key drivers of long-term sustainable development among Lake Victoria Basin communities, strengthening the ability of households, communities, and the ecosystem's ability to cope with growing pressures within the Basin.FundingMacArthur, The David and Lucile Packard Foundations, USAID, BARR, and Winslow and Margaret Cargill Foundations.",

    "ab": "To many, it seemed unlikely to have an impact. In Paris, in 2015, tens of thousands of delegates representing hundreds of countries were trying to agree a new global treaty for climate action. The talks were complex and tense, and ultimately successful. But while the limelight was on the big-picture politics of negotiating a deal that was acceptable to both the US and China, in which billions of dollars of financing for climate programmes could be unlocked, a group of small island states were pushing to modify the deal by literally half a degree. For decades, politicians had operated on the basis that limiting global warming to 2°C would be sufficient. But for those facing up to the harshest and most imminent impacts of climate change, this was not good enough. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) demanded more. The long-standing 2°C goal was too risky, they argued. The Paris Agreement needed to commit to limiting warming to just 1·5°C above pre-industrial levels. After hundreds of small countries brought their collective will to bear on the negotiations, the Paris Agreement duly included the 1·5°C goal as an “ambition”. Before fully committing, however, the UN “invited” the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—its independent scientific advisory body—to produce a report outlining the implications of limiting warming to this new, more ambitious, level. One year on from its publication, the IPCC's Special Report on Global Warming of 1·5°C has “become a cornerstone of the way we now communicate about climate change”, Dharini Parthasarathy, a senior communications officer for campaign coordinators Climate Action Network, says. “We had some concerns about how the report would turn out and whether it would be too conservative, and whether people would reject the science, and all the usual controversies around IPCC reports”, she explains. “But I think in an unexpected way it changed the conversation around climate change and was instantly picked up at a very conversational level among just ordinary people.” Alex Randall, an analyst with Climate Outreach, a charity that works with researchers to communicate climate science, agrees that it made a splash in a way research rarely does. “The reaction to the report was fundamentally different to the way the public and the media had reacted to previous IPCC reports. It felt like this was a point where a new section of the public really grasped the urgency of the situation”, he says. “What the 1·5°C report did was make that urgency clear in a very stark way that perhaps previous IPCC reports hadn't, because this was the first time that a report had been framed in terms of presenting us with a boundary—this idea of the 1·5°C line beyond which we should not cross.” The report's findings were certainly newsworthy. “We have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe”, read one now famous headline. The report was a “final call to save the world from ‘climate catastrophe’”, read another. In summary, the report says: “that if we are not doing anything, then we will very quickly reach 1·5°C of warming and catalyse impacts that put certain ecosystems in a permanent state of decline; valuable reefs or the Arctic or mountain systems and so on”, explains Dr Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College, University of London. He argues that this sense of urgency was the report's key contribution: “It's not 12 years before crunch time. It is actually this year, and it's next year, and it's every year that emissions and ambition need to be increased if we really want to keep warming to 1·5°C.” Unlike previous reports, that limit came with a clear policy prescription attached, argues Professor Niklas Höhne, a founding partner of the New Climate Institute NGO. “The report very clearly stated that global CO2 emissions need to be net zero by 2050 if we want to keep 1·5°C within reach. And that is a very simple goal”, he says. “The 1·5°C target is opaque—we don't really know what that means. But if we say we need to get rid of coal, oil, and gas or fossil fuels globally by 2050, that's something very tangible.” Understanding what the 1·5°C limit means in policy terms is vital to achieving the action scientists say is needed, Höhne says. “I think that a lot of countries had not understood at the time of the Paris Agreement what they were signing up to. In 2015, many policymakers had not understood that keeping warming to 1·5°C means zero emissions by 2050. That is super ambitious, and now more and more people are understanding that this what they've signed up to.” That shift from halving emissions in 2050 to having net-zero emissions by the same point was a massive change for politicians to accept, he observes: “It's a completely different situation. You need a complete different set of policies and a completely different mindset to cope with that change.” Nonetheless, “now, only one year after the report, more people are realising something significant needs to happen.” And things are changing. The UK government was the first major economy to formally agree a target to reduce emissions to net-zero by 2050. Norway has gone further, setting the same target by 2030. California has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2045, with Tokyo and many other cities pledging the same by 2050. Countries including Austria, Costa Rica, and Tuvalu have all set goals to reach 100% zero-carbon or renewable electricity by between 2020 and 2040. The significance of those actions is not lost on the nations that first called for serious consideration of a 1·5°C limit. And the AOSIS countries are no longer alone in pushing for more ambitious action, Höhne says. “It was the most vulnerable countries that really pushed for 1·5°C rather than the 2°C goal. And they did it because they are really affected by even 1·5°C of warming. And now that it's in the Paris Agreement, and now we have this 1·5°C report, there is much broader support.” Randall agrees that there is a geographic discrepancy in who the 1·5°C report immediately benefits. But that is no bad thing, he explains: “The 1·5°C report matters significantly more to some places and to some people than it does to others because you can see locations like the Pacific islands, the Horn of Africa, and the delta region of Bangladesh where crossing that 1·5°C line has much starker consequences for the people who live there than it does for other people who live elsewhere on the planet.” “Some of that has to do with geography and the disasters that they will face and the environment that will change around them, and a lot of it has to do with infrastructure, poverty, and inequality. And I think the 1·5°C report reinforced that message. It made it even more clear that there are certain places and certain groups of people to whom 1·5°C of warming really matters.” That message has resonated with young people, who seem particularly sensitive to current global injustices and are afraid for their future, Randall says. “The report seemed to unleash a wave of public anger or disillusionment about climate change. My sense is that anger had been growing over a number of years, but the 1·5°C report really galvanised public opinion around it. And I think that even though those movements have been growing and there had been gradually increasing levels of concern, that kind of raw anger we saw in the school strikes wouldn't have quite been there without the 1·5°C report to back it up.” Höhne agrees that the report seemed to strike a chord with the younger generation more than others. “They are very intelligent and they read their stuff. And if you read it with no background in the area, it's frightening”, he argues. “It's really saying we are running towards the cliff edge, and we are accelerating instead of putting the brakes on.” Ultimately, the urgency of public calls for action bodes well for the future of the international negotiations, Parthasarathy argues: “Now ordinary people can challenge politicians and say ‘have you read the IPCC report?’”, she says. “It's become the definitive text by which we are challenging decisionmakers to take action.” And it's all thanks to a report that for many didn't seem truly necessary. Growing out of consumption?Just over a year ago, the IPCC published a Special Report outlining what it would take to prevent global heating of more than 1·5°C and 2°C above preindustrial levels, and the projected impacts of each outcome. For many climate change insiders this felt like it was going to be a “more of the same” report. One that provided updated and stronger, but largely confirmatory information on the emission cuts needed to avoid the most damaging effects of climate breakdown and meet the Paris Agreement objectives.

    "ab": "In a Comment in this issue of The Lancet Planetary Health, Jessica Bogard and colleagues discuss the role of fish and seafood in future sustainable diets. They highlight some of the benefits of consuming seafood as a major source of dietary protein, as well as the challenges involved in measuring its true sustainability. The UN estimates that around 3 billion people are dependent on seafood as their primary protein source, while over 200 million people are employed in work related to marine fisheries. These figures alone—not to mention the many other links between human societies and the ocean—highlight the scale of the threat that could arise if we do not find a way of managing our oceans sustainably. However, while the role of life in our oceans is valued enough to have Sustainable Development Goal 14 dedicated to its preservation, it is under threat every bit as much as life on land. Over the past couple of years, the staggering challenges related to plastic waste pollution have entered the public consciousness and drawn some much needed attention to the links between human health and that of our oceans. Upsetting as stories of animals choking on plastic are, perhaps the most frightening aspect of plastic pollution is that the long-term effects are still largely unknown. And plastics are not the only pollutants entering the oceans of which our understanding remains limited. As discussed in The Lancet Commission on pollution and health, no basic toxicity data are publicly available for about half of the roughly 5000 high-volume chemicals produced around the world, many of which will eventually make their way into the seas. Even if these chemicals that have yet to be studied in depth prove not to be harmful, there are plenty of pollutants that we know can cause serious harm. The heavy metal mercury, for example, is deposited into water after being released by burning coal and other fossil fuels, where it undergoes conversion to the more hazardous methylmercury. Methylmercury bioaccumulates along the food chain resulting in dangerously high levels in apex predators such as marine mammals and tuna, which when consumed by pregnant women or children, can have harmful neurodevelopmental effects, not to mention the harmful effects experienced by the animals themselves. Without a method to extract the methylmercury from the water, the simplest method to manage the problem is to avoid eating the potentially contaminated animals, which creates additional demands for other food sources and places a disproportionate burden on Indigenous populations who have a traditional role for such foodstuffs. It is not only directly poisonous pollutants that can disrupt aquatic ecosystems and contaminate food supplies. Human activities that result in eutrophication or climate change-associated alterations to water temperature, acidity, or salinity can stimulate the growth of pathogenic organisms, such as members of the Vibrio genus of bacteria, and exacerbate natural processes such as harmful algal blooms. Vibrio species can cause illness in humans, fish, and other marine life, including corals. Harmful algal blooms, meanwhile, can have more generalised effects such as causing hypoxia that results in mass fish mortality. Furthermore, many harmful algae release their own toxins, which can affect those who ingest them, whether directly or via contaminated seafood (particularly shellfish), with results ranging from diarrhoeal illness to neurotoxic effects. Monitoring seafood for potential contamination is a major undertaking, and while tools such as the European Union's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed have been largely successful in preventing mass poisoning events, they add to the costs of aquaculture and could deter investment in a potentially sustainable method of food production. With the oceans seeming to have a larger role than ever in the future of human societies, now is a time to pay attention to these challenges and take action to prevent the situation getting any worse. Ocean pollution has much in common with freshwater pollution, with shared contaminants and, potentially, shared solutions. As with other types of pollution, the effects are often felt far from the source and international cooperation will be essential. There is, however, cause to hope on this front. March 25 to April 5, 2019, marked the second of four rounds of talks at the United Nations, as member states try to work out a new Global Ocean Treaty to define protected areas of the high seas and ways to enforce this protection. With goals of protecting as much as 30% of the world's ocean by 2030, real improvements could be within the delegates' reach. This is an opportunity that must not be lost.",

    "ab": "Development within the Amazon rainforest is a contentious topic, and one that has received renewed focus since the election of Jair Bolsonaro as President of Brazil. While much attention has been given to the destruction of the rainforest due to unchecked development, the framing of the discussion has largely been in terms of the long-term impacts on carbon storage and biodiversity this will have at the global level. Marcia Castro (Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, USA) and co-authors instead look at the local and immediate effects of unsustainable development in the Brazilian Amazon on vector-borne diseases. They find that the creation of habitats suitable for mosquito vectors was one of the major drivers, leading to the spread of diseases such as malaria, dengue, Zika, and chikungunya in poorly planned urban environments and recently deforested areas. Castro and colleagues call for greater coordination of existing disease surveillance mechanisms, greater consideration of planned development at the regional level (including across borders), and revisiting current austerity measures to focus on reducing inequalities as potential ways to mitigate these harmful effects of development. Consumer preference has been identified as a powerful tool in the shift to more sustainable diets, and food labelling is a relatively simple measure to affect this preference. However, most research on food labelling has been on health and nutrition labelling, with less work on sustainability-related labelling. Rebecca Tobi (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK) and co-authors conducted a systematic review of studies on consumer preferences for nutrition labels against those providing environmental and social responsibility (eg, animal welfare or fair trade) details. The social and environmental label attributes were favoured in 17 of 30 studies identified, and combinations of attributes were valued more highly than attributes in isolation. Notably, labels stating that products were organic were the preferred type of environmental label, likely due to assumptions about the healthiness of such products. While labelling can help to guide consumers towards more sustainable choices, care must be taken not to relieve manufacturers and governments of their responsibilities in making these choices as easy and fair as possible. Heatwaves are one of the most readily apparent impacts of climate change, and can severely harm human health, food systems, and ecosystems. Understanding the processes that underlie these events is crucial for predicting them, as well as how the will be affected by a changing climate. Kathrin Wehrli (Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science, Switzerland) and co-authors used the Community Earth System Model to analyse five heatwaves from 2010 to 2016. They looked at the relative contributions of several factors to these events, namely greenhouse gas forcing, land surface (ie, soil moisture), atmospheric circulation, and ocean conditions. Among the five heatwaves studied, the roles of atmospheric circulation and soil moisture were consistently the largest, and events were amplified by recent climate change. Anomalous declines in soil moisture were identified in the months preceding four of the five heatwaves, indicating that preconditioning of soil moisture is an important factor for modelling heatwaves. This, the authors highlight, could be a challenge as land surface models for weather prediction typically receive less attention than their atmospheric counterparts. The publication of the IPCC's special report Global Warming of 1·5°C in October, 2018, was a major event within the climate change community, but its effect on the wider public perception of climate change is less well understood. Charles Ogunbode (University of Bergen, Norway) and colleagues used data from representative surveys of the Norwegian population to investigate whether exposure to the report was associated with people's perceptions of the threat of climate change and how these perceptions changed before and after its release. They find that concern about climate change generally increased after the report was published, and that the increase in concern was greatest among those people who reported exposure to the report. When analysed by political orientation, the increase in concern was greatest among people who identified with the political left, and declined as political beliefs moved towards the right, eventually becoming non-significant at the far right of the spectrum. While the findings reflect the polarisation associated with the issue, the authors conclude that reports such as this can still have an important role in promoting engagement and action on climate change.",

    "ab": "It is possible to view the last few years as a period in which we have made good progress on climate change. We had the landmark Paris Agreement in late 2016 setting out an international framework for keeping climate warming below 2°C above pre-industrial levels (and aspiring for 1·5 °C). Numerous rounds of IPCC Assessment Reports have demonstrated clear actionable evidence, based on a rapidly growing body of science, and in late 2018 the IPCC produced a so called Special Report on Global Warming of 1·5 °C which mapped out the relative impacts of climate changes of 1·5 and 2°C of warming and the emissions pathways needed to keep warming within these limits. Most recently there has been a rapid upsurge in public awareness and concern, particularly among the young, perhaps driven by growing understanding of the scientific evidence or perhaps by the increasingly obviously altered conditions we keep experiencing. Whatever the cause the increased public attention and growth of mass activism has led a number of national and regional governments to declare a climate emergency with many now aiming for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or earlier. The last few years has also seen a groundswell of engagement from medical professionals with many medical organisations and vocal individuals declaring their concern about the health impacts of unchecked climate change and the many health benefits of policies to curtail climate change. Additionally we have seen truly impressive progress in renewable energy, particularly solar and wind and associated battery technologies, with rapid reductions in unit cost and as a result tremendous growth in installed capacity at a time when coal power is declining steeply. This all sounds encouraging but in spite of these positive steps global CO2 emissions have remained inexorably on the rise. The juxtaposition of increasing public awareness and concern about climate change and insufficient progress in tackling the problem is making many feel worried about the future, including their own wellbeing and even whether it is wise to have children, such that the term eco-anxiety has moved into the popular lexicon. Although the Paris Agreement was deliberately structured in such a way as to ratchet up ambition over time, it is clear that if we are to even get close to limiting warming to 2°C we need a step change in efforts with a tangible impact on emissions and very soon. It is with precisely this in mind that UN Secretary-General António Guterres has convened the UN Climate Action Summit to be held in New York this September, with the aim of encouraging leaders to come with ambitious but also practical, implementable plans that will form the basis for the revision of nationally determined contributions when nations update their emissions pledges next year. Some of the clearest and loudest voices on the mismatch between the action needed to tackle the climate crisis and the actual level of progress to date are youth voices, most notably Gretta Thunberg and the Fridays for future school strike movement which has grown to have global reach. A Feature in this issue looks at how the youth movement has grown to make such an impact in the last year or so, culminating in the September Global Strike aimed at influencing the UN Climate Action Summit. We also have a Comment reflecting on the particular value of youth engagement for Planetary Health and some of the steps needs to make youth engagement genuinely meaningful. In the light of the growing youth voice on climate it is refreshing to see that there will for the first time be a youth focussed component to the UN Summit. This is designed to be a platform for young people who are pushing for climate action to showcase their solutions and engage with decision-makers on the key issues. The Global Strikes between September 20–27, which will bracket the UN climate talks, are expected to be largest climate demonstration in history involving millions of people across 2500 events in 117 countries. These demonstrations involve everyone but have been driven by youth activism. Of course, young people are generally still far from the corridors of power but there is evidence that the sway in public opinion they are garnering is beginning to change the conversation, even during these politically hostile times. For example, it's hard to imagine just months ago that many key Democratic candidates in the US would take part in 7 hours of back to back televised discussion of their climate policies, with nearly all advocating for net zero emission by 2050. There is room for cautious optimism but as the youth keep reminding us our house is on fire and we aren't acting like it.",

    "ab": "In January this year, The Lancet Planetary Health called for research pertaining to all of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Now, with publication in The Lancet of a comprehensive guide to the state of global health financing, a clearer picture emerges of the perilous state of the health of the poorest members of our civilisation. Whether their countries' health systems can be funded and improved—in an environmentally sustainable way—is the looming challenge to the global community's ability to reach the SDGs that aim to end poverty, reduce inequality, and promote health for all. Between 1995 and 2016, per capita health spending grew by 2·7% per year worldwide to US$8·0 trillion overall, but in low-income countries (home to 732 million people) the yearly spend per person increased only 1·5%, from $30 in 1995 to $40 in 2016. In 22 countries, health spending rose by less than a dollar per person in the 20 years to 2016. Substantial improvements to health cannot occur with such a dearth of funding. The greatest contribution to increases in health financing in low-income countries came from development assistance for health (DAH), chiefly money from the US and other states' governments and private philanthropy. DAH is one of the great political and philanthropic endeavours of our time. However, appetite for DAH is politically volatile, the extent to which it displaces governmental spending on health (fungibility) is unclear, and issues surround accountability and priority setting. Moreover, if global development aid is diverted to combat climate change, health funding will suffer despite existing synergies. Growth in DAH in absolute terms has plateaued and is predicted to rise only slowly to 2050. Ultimately, any resilient health system will need to be able to operate in the absence of external donor funding. Poverty is not restricted to low-income nations, with most (73%) of the world's poor living in middle-income countries. DAH only comprises a small segment of total health spend in middle-income countries (0·2–3·2% in 2016). Nevertheless, these countries still received 57% of global DAH in 2016, suggesting substantial inequality, and that a hidden poor will be missing from high-level assessment of the SDGs if a country-level approach is taken. Measurement of the SDG targets ought to take account of unsustainable or unstable funding sources. In the health financing transition model, countries start with a low level of health spending, principally out of pocket, then transition to increased spending through government financing. In the short term, low-income countries will continue to rely on out-of-pocket payments and donor funding. In the longer term, strategies are needed that increase government investment and levels of prepaid resources to avoid individuals experiencing catastrophic health expenditure. How though, can low-income countries' governments prioritise health spending (the key driver of increased government spending, alongside overall economic development)? The decision to prioritise health is not in of itself an endpoint. Parkinson's law—the adage that work expands so as to fill any and all available time—is equally true of health-care costs. As income rises, countries can spend more on health but value may diminish. Research into sustainable approaches to end poverty and break the impasse in health funding in low-income countries is essential to the notion of planetary health. In particular, what advances could be made via leapfrogging (eg, skipping expensive development phases) or use of tried and tested approaches to resource allocation (eg, favouring strong primary care and disease prevention)? Is redistribution of DAH from middle-income countries to low-income countries viable or desirable? To what extent is fungibility a threat to government health spending? And at the individual level, how can the challenge of increasing out-of-pocket and other private spending (eg, health insurance or direct service payment by companies) be addressed? Low-income countries have been unable to realise the gains in health spending seen in middle-income countries over the past 20 years. While development assistance for health increased per person from $3 in 1995 to $10 in 2016, overall spending rose by just $10. If seven out of every ten extra dollars spent on health in low-income countries is DAH, it is clear that future developments need to take a different track. Governments also need development assistance to raise more and spend more money on health; a civilisation cannot be considered truly healthy while nearly a billion people are adrift.",
