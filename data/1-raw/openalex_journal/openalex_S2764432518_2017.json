Many risk factors and barriers for care seeking influencing the prevalence of ARI and pneumonia.MethodsA community based cross sectional study was undertaken in two slums of Dibrugarh town that were randomly selected.SubjectSelection was done by probability proportionate to size technique. A total of 624 children were examined by house to house visit.ResultsPrevalence of pneumonia was 16.34%. Socio economic status (p = 0.005), education of mothers (p = 0.000), timely initiation of complementary feeding (p = 0.006), complete immunization (p = 0.000) and indoor air pollution (p = 0.000), were significantly associated with occurrence of pneumonia. In multivariate analysis, pneumonia is significantly associated with indoor air pollution.ConclusionHigh prevalence of pneumonia and its association with different preventable risk factors needs to be addressed. Different community based intervention can be implemented to reduce this preventable morbidities.",

    "ab": "Background with objectivesCommunity acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of childhood deaths globally. Poor recognition of the danger signs of CAP, inappropriate care seeking, and community distrust in the primary health system are factors largely responsible for CAP related deaths in rural India. Our objective was to develop and pilot test culturally sensitive communication messages for improving symptom recognition of CAP as a means of encouraging timely health care seeking, and to promote trust in the government primary health system as an effective source of CAP treatment among children.Methods and materialsQualitative research was carried out between February and July 2014 in the states of Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) and Bihar in northern India. Message development entailed a six-step process: (1) theme identification, (2) creative conceptualization of messages, (3) pretesting messages in focus groups (FGs), (4) modification of messages, tagline/logo based on feedback, (5) piloting modified messages in FGs and further refinement and (6) harmonization of final communication products to ensure consistency.ResultsMessages were piloted in 49 FGs in 7 rural districts. Hindi terms for the signs of respiratory illness and lay use of \"pneumonia\" as a term encompassing CAP were understandable across all dialects. Five text, five audio and four video based messages were initially developed and pretested. Three text based messages, four audio and three video were deemed acceptable for pilot testing and refinement. Messages selected for use in future communication programs balanced measures of popularity with measures of maximum comprehension and least misunderstanding. Messages selected were harmonized so they would reinforce one another. Common logo and tagline ensured that the messages would be seen as components of a new outreach program associated with the government's efforts to address CAP as a primary healthcare priority.ConclusionsCulturally sensitive messages for improving case management of CAP were developed through a multi-stage, evidence-based research process in a rural population. They need to accompany health systems strengthening efforts to increase confidence in government health facilities.",

    "ab": "IntroductionFast food is processed and prepared in an industrial fashion. Vitamins, minerals, fibre and amino acids are low or lacking in fast food but has high energy (calories).The present study was done to assess the knowledge and practice of fast food consumption among Pre-University College students.Materials and methodsThe study design adopted was cross-sectional. Semi-structured self-administered questionnaire were used to collect the data. Time bound enumeration was used to recruit the participants and total 160 Pre-University students were included in the study.ResultAbout 51(31.87%) of the participants had inadequate knowledge, 67(41.88%) of the participants had moderate knowledge and 42(26.25%) of the participants had adequate knowledge about the effect of fast food consumption. The majority of the respondents 116 (72.5%) reported that the main reason for their consumption is a delicious taste of fast food.ConclusionThough fast foods are tasty they have low nutritive value and high calories. Nutrition counselling regarding the significance of a balanced diet and harmful effects of fast foods may help to curb the fast food addiction.",

    "ab": "BackgroundBreast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women worldwide and it is found to be increasing. Breast cancer survivors are threatened with various problems due to disease itself or its treatment and might exist for a long period even after treatment. The existing knowledge on experiences and needs among breast cancer survivors in India is very limited. The present study aimed to explore the experiences and needs of breast cancer survivors.MethodsIn the present study qualitative study design was used and 17 breast cancer survivors, post six months of completed cancer treatment were selected using purposive sampling technique. In-depth interviews were conducted, the data was transcribed and translated and codes and theme were developed.ResultsThe study explored the needs and experiences of breast cancer survivors. The experiences of breast cancer survivors were as follows; awareness, psychological expressions, spirituality and misconceptions, economic burden, confinement, body image and bashfulness, maintaining secrecy, family support and physical burden. The needs of breast cancer survivors were identified as financial, informational, breast reconstruction surgery, help in household activities, family support, counseling and emotional support.ConclusionRecognizing the experiences and needs of the breast cancer survivors by the family members, health care workers, community members and policy makers after the end of treatment is important to facilitate optimal delivery of health care at the community settings to improve the quality of life of breast cancer survivors.",

    "ab": "Problem consideredIron deficiency during pregnancy is identified as a serious public health problem in most developing countries including India. In India, the majority of the pregnant women are anemic due to a variety of biological and socioeconomic reasons. The purpose of this study is to assess the factors influencing the consumption of Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation in high focus states of India.Material and MethodsThe present study is based on National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3, 2005-06) data. 11085 Recently delivered women. Variables named religion, place of residence, women's and education, birth order, wealth index, husband's education, husband's occupation, type of caste/tribe, and husband present during antenatal care (ANC) visit were taken as predictors. Women who received at least 90 IFA tablets were considered as outcome variable.ResultsWell educated women are four times more likely to adhere recommended dose of iron supplements (OR = 4.21; 95% CI = 3.30–5.36, p < 0.01). Women with birth order below 2 (OR = 2.33; 95% CI = 1.84–2.95, p < 0.01), women whose husbands are present during ANC visits (OR = 2.17; CI = 1.92–2.45, p < 0.01) and women with high socioeconomic status (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.70–2.65, p < 0.01) are more likely to consume at least 90 days' iron supplement. Women who had any mass media exposure had 1.34 times (OR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.13–1.58, p < 0.01) more chances to intake at least 90 IFA tablets.ConclusionsHigher education and lower birth order infer to more iron consumption among pregnant women.",

    "ab": "BackgroundChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is associated with multiple health problems including physical and psychological impairment as well as socioeconomic deprivation. COPD can be managed if self-management efficiency and disease management knowledge of patients is improved. Patient activation is believed to improve patients' quality of life (QOL) and health outcomes through enhancing self-management skills. This review is an attempt to identify the benefits and knowledge gaps in self-management and patient-activation position in COPD self-management interventionsMethodsFour electronic databases (Medline, Pubmed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Airways Group Specialized Register of Trials) were systematically searched from 1 January 2011 to 30 November 2016. The search strategy included the combined use of MedicalSubjectHeadings (MeSH) term, which are as follows; \"Self-management\", \"Self-care\", \"Self-treat\", \"Pulmonary disease\", \"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\", \"Patient activation\", \"Patient Activation Measure\", \"Personalized support\", \"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\", \"COPD\". The screening of the abstracts and full texts of the papers, data extraction and quality assessment were independently done by three reviewers.ResultsThe results of this review showed that health outcomes (QOL, perceived quality of care, knowledge and severity on disease, lower rate of exacerbation, patient activation level) can be improved by self-management interventions with well cleared content on self-care guidelines and targeted behavior change models that possibly can increase self-efficacy of the patients. However, most of the studies have not applied patient activation which is shown to play a central role in COPD self-management behaviors.ConclusionsThis review has identified that there is paucity of literature on patient activation in tailored COPD self-management intervention. As a way forward, there is need to test a well-designed randomized controlled trial considering key points like patients characteristics, compliance, intervention delivery period, multi-morbidity conditions and measurement of the outcomes with standardized tools, might help to arrive at enable scientific conclusions.",

    "ab": "BackgroundCancer is an important health issue. According to the WHO report, globally, cervical cancer comprises 12% of all cancers in women and it is the leading gynaecological malignancy in the world. In many developing countries, it is the most common cancer among women where 85% of the estimated 493 000 new cases and 273 000 deaths in 2002 occurred worldwide.Objectives1. To study the association between cervical cancer and parity. 2. To study the association between cervical cancer and other selected exposure variablesSettings and designA hospital based case-control study was conducted in Shirdi Sai Baba Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Manipal, Udupi DistrictMethods and materialA total of 273 participants (91 cases and 182 controls) were included. Information on demographics, habits, reproductive history, sexual history and menstrual history was taken using a semi-structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis used: Data was analysed using SPSS version 15. Univariate and Multivariate logistic regression was used to find out the association between the outcome and exposure variables. Results are expressed in odds ratio.ResultsMarital status (married) is an important risk factor for cervical cancer, OR = 2.98 (1.23–7.20). People having history of alcohol use were at 4.55 (1.17–17.73) times at risk of developing cervical cancer when compared to those who did not use alcohol. Age at menarche of 13–14 years was found to be a significant risk factor of cervical cancer with OR of 2.91(1.18–7.20). Age at 1st coitus of <18 years had an odds ratio of 5.44(2.73–6.38) and was significantly associated. At least one abortion is an important risk factor with odds of 2.61 (1.70–18.96). Also, adjusted odds ratio for parity of 3–5 was 3.16 (1.12–8.91) and 5.57 (1.70–18.96) for women having ≥6 parity when compared to women having parity of less than 3 and was statistically significant.ConclusionsThe study showed that marital status, history of alcohol use, <18 years of age at first coitus, age at menarche and parity of >3 as risk factors of cervical cancer",

    "ab": "IntroductionProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the widely used drugs available as over the counter for treatment of acid-related gastrointestinal disorders. Concerns have been raised about the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) with the prolonged use of PPIs. This meta-analysis aims to determine the association between PPI use and risk of developing CKD.MethodsThe methodology complies with our registered protocol at PROSPERO (CRD42016040073). PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to 27th September 2017. Two reviewers independently screened and selected the observational studies comparing CKD outcome in patients on PPI. The quality of selected studies was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were also performed. All the analysis was performed by using RevMan v5.3.ResultsThe 6 included studies comprised of 4 cohorts and 2 case-control studies with 720758 patients from cohort and 84078 patients from the case-control study. All the studies were of highest quality. Overall pooled relative risk (RR) of developing CKD was 1.32(95% CI 1.19 to 1.46), (p-value = <0.00001) and for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) RR was 1.88 (95% CI: 1.71 to 2.07), (p = <0.00001) in patients receiving PPI. The higher incidence of CKD was seen in diabetic patients taking PPI with RR of 1.82 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.72), (p-value = 0.004).ConclusionAn association between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of developing chronic kidney disease and ESRD was found in the study.",

This study aims to investigate the incidence of migraine headache and the factors associated with it among medical students.MethodologyThe present research is a descriptive, cross-sectional study. The sample size includes 390 subjects that were selected through proportionate stratified random sampling. To this purpose we used a questionnaire that was designed according to international headache standards criteria. Data was analyzed by SPSS. Accordingly, chi-square, independent t-test, and logistic regression were used for evaluation of clinical data.ResultsIn the finding it was reviled that 318 subjects out of 390 participants in the study had experienced headache (81.53%). In total, 27 subjects (6.9%) were suffering from migraine including 77.8% women and 22.2% men. The most common complication of migraine headache is dizziness by 17.2%. Factors intensifying migraine headaches include stress (63%), sunlight or fluorescent light (55.6%), loud noise (48.1%), fatigue (77.8%), and overheating (51.9%).Conclusionamong the factors affecting the intensification of migraine headaches, stress, sunlight, noise, fatigue, heat, menstruation in women, too much work, late sleep at night and some foods such as fish, caffeine, pepper, fat and fried foods were also identified as the food factors intensifying migraine headaches. Since the students of medical sciences are a part of health care system and such headaches will reduce their efficiency in health care delivery. Socio-economic impact of migraine on quality of life of student considerable and must be emphasized in health-treatment programs and plans.",

    "ab": "BackgroundAgeing is not an illness, but the elderly are vulnerable to slowly evolving chronic diseases. The difficulties faced by the elderly are uncountable leading to social and cultural differences in the present Indian society.ObjectiveThis study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile, lifestyle practices and morbidities of the elderly and their association, particularly with non-communicable diseases.Methodology: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the field practice area of a medical college in a city in north part of India. A total of 225 elderly patients (60 years old and above) residing in urban area were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire through house-to-house visit.ResultsOut of the total, there were 51.1% females (n = 115), 99.1% Hindus (n = 223), 51.1% married (n = 115), 79.6% lived in joint families (n = 179) and 52.9% belonged to upper middle class (n = 119). Tobacco consumption was seen in 62.1% (smoking; n = 110) and 19.7% (smokeless; n = 35) elderly. About 18% (n = 32) were consuming alcohol. More than half of the study participants were not doing physical activity. Majority of the elderly in the study (n = 197; 87.6%) had one or more diagnosed diseases at the time of study. Morbidity was found associated with type of family, regular exercise, dietary habit, addiction user, duration of smoking, socio-economic status, alcohol consumption, smoking and tobacco chewing.ConclusionMany of the lifestyle practices such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity were prevalent amongst elderly. Majority of them were suffering from more than one morbidity, which was found to be associated with their unhealthy lifestyle practices. There is a need to target interventions for inculcating healthy lifestyle practices amongst elderly.",

    "ab": "ObjectivesTo study socio-cultural impact of PCOS on Indian Women especially those belonging to Economically Weaker Section (EWS).MethodologyIt is a field work based study in which females suffering from PCOS were interviewed in the Outpatient Department (OPD) of a Government Hospital in Jammu. Majority of the respondents belonged to EWS and did not know anything about PCOS. Semi-structured interview schedule was used to interview patients who visited OPD for the treatment. Entire data were collected from 15th November 2016 to 31st December 2016. Information provided by respondents is used as narratives in the present study. Theories of stigma and social construction of illness have been used to analyse respondents' approach towards the disease and the way they perceive the onset of PCOS.Results and discussionsEntire discussion part has been sub-divided into: PCOS as a tabooed disease; infertility: a major consequence of PCOS; Lack of awareness about the disease; and social construction of PCOS. Respondents are found to have a grave concern about the disease due to their inability to adhere to the socially constructed role of a woman. Since, menstruation is still a tabooed topic of discussion in many parts of Indian society, hence they abstain from discussing about irregularity of periods till situation goes out of hand. Married women are marred by the stigma of infertility and unmarried ones fear future infertility.ConclusionLack of awareness and compulsion to fulfil socially expected role of a woman, women suffering from PCOS, in this part of India, aim only at becoming pregnant (in case of married women) and normalising their monthly periods (in case of unmarried females). However, there is need to spread awareness about PCOS and encouraging women to adopt knowledge, attitude and practice approach to manage this disease.",

    "ab": "ObjectivesPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a higher incidence of bladder cancer (BC); however, the evidence underlining the association between pioglitazone use and BC risk remains inconclusive. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to investigate the effect of pioglitazone on risk of BC in T2DM patients.MethodsWe searched all publications regarding risk of BC with pioglitazone use through PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane library databases from inception to March, 2017. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method.ResultsTotal 15 observational (9 cohort and 6 case-control) studies were meta-analyzed. The pooled results showed a significant association between risk of BC and pioglitazone use (HR 1.20, 95%CI 1.09–1.31; P< 0.0001; I2 = 4%). In subgroup analysis, cumulative dose of pioglitazone (− and >mg) showed a significant association with risk of BC (HR 1.27; 95%CI 1.05–1.54; P = 0.01; I2 = 0% and HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.36–2.08; P< 0 I2 = 0% respectively). In addition, a significant association was seen with risk of BC and pioglitazone treatment duration (12–24 months and >24 months) (HR 1.43; 95%CI 1.19–1.71; P = 0.0001; I2 = 0% and HR 1.58; 95%CI 1.27–1.97; P< 0.0001; I2 = 29% respectively). Meta-analysis of pioglitazone vs. rosiglitazone use, showed a significant association (HR 1.34; 95%CI 1.05–1.71; P = 0.02; I2 = 0%) with BC risk and pioglitazone use.ConclusionPioglitazone use is associated with risk of BC in T2DM patients. Risk of bladder cancer appears to be associated with higher dose and longer duration of pioglitazone use.",

    "ab": "BackgroundAntibiotics, one of the frequently prescribed medications in modern medicine is plagued by misuse and consequent development of resistance. We report the knowledge and practice of antibiotic use and the extent of self-medication with antibiotics among health science students of a university in south India.MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out that included students from various disciplines such as Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Nursing. A random sample of 531 students, were recruited into the study and those students with a history of any chronic disease requiring long-term treatment were excluded.ResultsAlmost 58% reported using antibiotics in the last 3 months and 39% frequented its use over 3 times in a year. Thirty percent stated that they had procured antibiotics over the counter without a valid prescription. Common ailments that reportedly triggered antibiotic use, ranged from mild fever to skin infections. Medical (25%) & Dental (36%) students declared self-prescription as a frequent practice. β-lactam group was the most popular group of antibiotics, with over 44% vouching its use.ConclusionThere appears to be inadequate adherence to antibiotic policies among the study population warranting periodic training and monitoring. Establishment of an effective antibiotic stewardship could be the way forward.",

    "ab": "BackgroundIndia is one of the most privatised health systems with high OOP payment for health care in the world. The financial burden of OOP payment has an iniquitous effect on access to health care as it restricts health care accessibility among poor. To provide universal health care access to all its citizen government has launched health insurance programs in the recent past.ObjectiveThe study attempts to understand the impact of health insurance schemes on tackling the economic burden of out of pocket expenditure and its effectiveness in reducing economic inequalities in health care spending.MethodThe study utilises National Sample Survey 2014 data to fulfill the objectives. Bi-variate analysis and two-part model were used to examine the association of health insurance with the level of health expenditure and financial burden.ResultsThe paper shows that health insurance schemes are effective in reducing the burden of OOP expenditure but economic disparities in the financial burden of OOP expenditure exist where the poor with less income spends a greater share of household income than the rich.ConclusionAn increasing coverage of poor under health insurance no doubt protects against health care impoverishment, but mere provision health care does not address the issue of equity in health spending as the burden of health spending was more among poor. The major implication of the findings is that there is a need for analysing the efficiency and equity implication of the health insurance schemes in providing financial protection",

Micronutrients, including iron, zinc, vitamins A, C, D, and E exert important influences on immune system development during the neonatal period. An expert panel meeting was convened to provide insights on strategies to prevent and mitigate micronutrients deficiencies (MNDs) which impact the developing immune system. This review article provides evidence-based correlation between the role of nutrition and immunity, and provides recommendations on the current and future trends to prevent and treat MNDs in the Indian context.",

In India, LCPUFA intake during pregnancy is substantially low, mostly attributed to poor dietary intake. Infants are likely to have similar trend considering low intake of DHA in lactating mothers as well as low/absent DHA in bovine milk and standard infant formulae. Studies on maternal intake of DHA during pregnancy and lactation are in favor of routing supplementation. Though studies on benefits of DHA and ARA supplemented infant formulas have shown heterogeneous results, the latest long term studies showing better cognitive skills.",

    "ab": "IntroductionThere is lack of evidence available on understanding of exact trend and distribution of dual burden of nutrition in India.ObjectiveThe study aimed to find out 25 years trend of nutritional status among rural adults of six states in India, pooled estimate for India and predict the estimate for future 20 years.DesignThe body mass index (BMI) data of both men and women of six states and India for the year 1992–2011 was collected from the publicly available reports of National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) and for 2014–15 was taken from National Family and Health Survey –IV (NFHS-IV). The data for monthly per capita expenditure was extracted from national sample survey (NSS) reports. The 25-year historical BMI prevalence data between 1991–92 and 2014 were tested for linear, quadratic and cubic trends. The analysis was done using STATA.SettingsData for six states of India and pooled estimate of India was collected and analyzed.Main findingsAll states show a decline trend in underweight and increase trend in overweight/obesity. The pooled estimates for India reports though the trend of underweight is declining in both men and women still it is above 20% and after 20 years the prevalence will be 10%. The trend test for overweight/obesity was found to be significant at P value < 0.05 in all the six states and India in both the sex.ConclusionThe regional variances in prevalence of the nutrition among rural Indians and suggests state specific nutritional policy should be developed for double burden of nutrition.",

    "ab": "IntroductionTo improve access to basic health services, Government of India, in 2005, inducted Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHAs) as community health workers. Evaluation of ASHA program in Howrah district of West Bengal indicated low performance of ASHAs in providing maternal care. We conducted an unmatched case-control study to identify factors associated with low performance of ASHA in Howrah district.MethodsWe categorized 993 ASHAs as low (cases) and 994 as adequate (controls) performing, based on average incentive received by each ASHA, and randomly selected 261 cases and 261 controls. We interviewed ASHAs to collect information about factors influencing their performance including socio-economic details, workload, training and support and supervision. We calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals using simple and multiple logistic regression respectively.ResultCompared to adequate performing ASHAs, low performing ASHAs were more likely to serve larger population than the recommended norm of 1200 [OR: 1.8; 95%CI: 1.2–2.5] or got less supervisory visits by Auxiliary Nurse and Midwife (ANM) in field [OR: 1.75; 95%CI: 1.03–2.98], did not have any stocks of Iron Folate tablets (IFA) [OR: 4.85; 95%CI: 1.37–17.1] and belonged to religious minority [OR: 2; 95%CI: 1.26–3.35].ConclusionLow performance of ASHAs was associated with population overburden, not having IFA in stock, less field visit by ANM and religious minority in Howrah district. For improving performance of ASHAs, we recommended recruiting new ASHA, ensuring uninterrupted IFA supply and strengthening supporting supervision. These measures need to focus on ASHAs belonging to Muslim religion.",

    "ab": "BackgroundHepatitis B infection is a leading pathogenic infection that constitutes occupational hazard to health care workers. The current study examines the knowledge of hepatitis B infection and hepatitis B vaccination and uptake of the vaccine among the cleaners in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria.Materials and methodsA cross-sectional hospital-based study of 89 cleaners using a standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire for data collection was conducted. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 21 software.ResultsAmong the participants, 12 (13.5%), 12 (13.5%) and 19 (21.3%) had low, medium and high-risk perception of acquiring hepatitis B infection respectively. Awareness of hepatitis B infection was low (65.2%). The mean knowledge scores concerning hepatitis B infection (4.24 out of 26) and hepatitis B vaccine (1.06 out of 26) were low. Twenty-five (28.1%) of the participants had ever had screening while none of them reported being vaccinated against hepatitis B.ConclusionsHospital cleaners have poor risk perception, low level of awareness and poor knowledge about hepatitis B infection. Health workers might differ in what they know about hepatitis B infection and vaccine because of the differences in the levels of education, training, and perceived relevance within hospital settings.",

    "ab": "ObjectiveForeign-origin street children are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS mainly due to poverty, violence, early sexual activity and poor access to health care services. This study aimed to highlight the effectiveness of peer education intervention to reduce HIV-risky behavior among street children with Afghan nationality.MethodsSixty-one street children were stratified by sex and then randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group by assigning each participant computerized random numbers. The intervention provided peer education services, focused on mode of disease transmission, prevention approaches and awareness of HIV/AIDS services by peers.ResultsAt least 80% of participants in the intervention and control groups completed the study period, respectively. At the end of the study, statistically significant increase of knowledge and attitude improvement as well as a decreased tendency to do risky sexual intercourse among the intervention subjects was shown. Moreover, there was a time intervention interaction for knowledge and attitude improvements followed by intervention (interaction p value = 0.001), while it was not significant for risky sexual behavior (interaction p value = 0.44).ConclusionPeer education was an effective and easy-to-apply educational method that increased knowledge and improved attitudes about HIV/AIDS among foreign-origin street children, while it was less efficient with regard to long-term reduction in risky sexual behavior.",

    "ab": "BackgroundThe frequency of colorectal carcinoma is inadequate in India compared to the western world. The carcinoma of colon and rectum is usually disturbing among the individuals of older age group whereas it is less frequent in younger age group. This study was based on age, gender, site of primary tumor and histopathological type of colorectal cancer cases.MethodsA retrospective study of 420 colorectal carcinoma cases admitted to Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute hospital, Kolkata, India during 2012–2016 was carried out. All the clinicopathological data was collected from the medical records of the patients. The detailed information was entered into tabular sheet and statistical analysis was performed.ResultsDuring these five years out of total cases in the Department of Surgical Oncology, 5.09% patients with colorectal carcinoma were admitted for colectomy or hemicolectomy. The percentage of younger age group (≤40 year) with colorectal cancer was rise up sharply in context of older age group (>60 year). The ratio of male and female affected in colorectal cancer was 1.6:1. Rectum was the most common site 46.2% among the total cancer lesions. From histopathological data, mucinous adenocarcinoma cases were identified with (23.6%) high frequency and mostly detected at younger age group (65.7%). It was found that 18.8% patients with synchronous liver metastasis and 16.7% of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus were likely to develop colorectal cancer.ConclusionThe concise overview has documented an increased incidence of colorectal carcinoma patients amongst younger individuals with more aggressive forms like mucinous adenocarcinoma and also development of synchronous liver metastasis.",

    "ab": "BackgroundThere has remained a need to better understanding of prognostic factors that affect the survival or risk in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), particularly in developing countries. The aim of the present study aimed to identify the prognostic factors influencing AIDS progression in HIV positive patients in Hamadan province of Iran, using random survival forest in the presence of competing risks (death from causes not related to AIDS). This method considers all interactions between variables and their nonlinear effects.MethodsA data set of 585 HIV-infected patients extracted from 1997 to 2011 was utilized. The effect of several prognostic factors on cumulative incidence function (probability) of AIDS progression and death were investigated.ResultsThe used model indicated that using antiretroviral therapy tuberculosis co-infection are two top most important variables in predicting cumulative incidence function for AIDS progression in the presence of competing risks, respectively. The patients with tuberculosis had much higher predicted cumulative incidence probability. Predicted cumulative incidence probability of AIDS progression was also higher for mother to child mode of HIV transmission. Moreover, transmission type and gender were two top most important variables for the competing event. Men and those patients with IDUS transmission mode had higher predicted risk compared to others.ConclusionsConsidering nonlinear effects and interaction between variables, confection with tuberculosis was the most important variable in prediction of cumulative incidence probability of AIDS progression.",

    "ab": "Problem consideredStroke or Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) is the leading cause of death and disability and is a major problem in most part of the world as reported by WHO.AimsTo estimate the clinico-epidemiological profile of acute stroke cases admitted in Assam Medical College and Hospital.MethodsAll consecutive cases attending the study site were enrolled and studied with predesigned questionnaires after obtaining ethical clearance for this observational study. Predesigned pretested questionnaire was used to assess socio-demographic profile, behavioural risk factor, health care seeking behaviour, dietary history, clinical examination along with routine blood examination and CT Scan. Statistical analysis was done using rates, ratio, proportion and chi-square test.ResultsOut of 470 cases enrolled the response rate was 96%. Average age was 54.3 ± 13 years with an average monthly income of Rs. 10,831. Majority were literate (76.4%). Majority presented with haemorrhagic cerebro-vascular accidents (CVA) (287, 63.6%), while 164 (36.4%) had ischemic CVA. Significant difference in prevalence of haemorrhagic and ischemic CVA in younger age group (p = 0.001), lower socio-economic strata (p = 0.001), patient's place of stay during symptom onset (p = 0.048) and mode of transportation to hospital (p = 0.021) was seen. Clinical signs and symptoms of ischemic and haemorrhagic CVA showed significant difference in symptoms like change in consciousness (p = 0.000), weakness in face/limb (p = 0.022), dysphagia (p = 0.042), headache (p = 0.006), diabetes (p = 0.001), tobacco consumption (p = 0.000) and alcohol consumption (p = 0.000). MLR showed significant association of haemorrhagic stroke with high salt consumption and loss of consciousness.Conclusionhaemorrhagic CVA constitutes a larger percentage of stroke subtypes on this side of the globe effecting poor to lower middle class. Proper strategy to prevent and treat haemorrhagic CVA in this part of the world is the need of the hour.",

    "ab": "BackgroundDesigning and implementation of screening programs depend on greatly epidemiologic basic data in every country. Also Variation in the incidence of various cancers in our country has been a favorite topic.ObjectivesThis systematic review was conducted to provide an overall perspective about incidence, geographical and age distribution of cancers in Iran.MethodsA comprehensive search were done according to MOOSE guideline criteria in national and international databases for selecting eligible articles from 2005 to 2015. After screening titles and abstracts, duplicated and irrelevant studies were excluded. Selected papers are written in Persian or English. The standard error of the cancer incidence was calculated based on the binomial distribution. Because of the significant heterogeneity observed among the results, we used a random-effects model combine the results of the primary studies. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken to explore the effects of the risk of bias and other sources of heterogeneity.ResultsOverall 16 articles met eligibility criteria for inclusion. The total incidence of cancer was 19.4 and 17.2 per hundred thousand of people in males and females respectively. The five most common cancers in male were: Lymphoma, leukemia, esophagus, stomach, colorectal and in the female are: breast, colorectal, stomach, thyroid and esophagus. The highest incidence rate was seen in Golestan Province and in the age group over 65 years.ConclusionAccording to increasing incidence rate of cancers in Iran, Development, holding and accomplish of universal public cancer control program should be the first precedence for health policy.",

    "ab": "BackgroundThe Antenatal care and institutional delivery to improve maternal and child health is the prime focus of the time. India, with its large economic diversity, the health care utilization may depend on type of service provider i.e. public or private. The present study estimates the trends in the utilization of public and private maternal health care services and the associated socio-demographic factors, the major focus being Antenatal care and skilled delivery.MethodologyThe present population based cross-sectional analysis is performed on the secondary data of India from three rounds of District Level Household Survey (DLHS) conducted in 1998–99, 2002–04 and 2007–08. Indicators for maternal health care utilization are based on full antenatal check up (FANC) as defined by RCH program and skilled institutional delivery attendance (SID) as defined by WHO by the mode of service provider (Public vs Private). Multinomial logistic regression was used for statistical analysis by considering these indicators as the outcome variables treating various socio-demographic factors as independent variables.ResultThe urban area, other than SC/ST caste, higher wealth index and more than 10 years of mother's & father's education have high proportion of maternal health care utilization. Lower parent's education have shown lower relative risk ratio of FANC and SID accessibility throughout the survey periods. Wealth indices as a factor of FANC and SID are observed higher in private sectors as compared to public sectors during second and third survey. Women with more pregnancy related problem have chosen private sector for their institutional delivery during all the survey periods. Maternal health programme related initiatives such as when health worker visit for antenatal care and women counselled to go for institutional delivery have shown improvement in terms of accessibility.ConclusionThis study used multinomial logistic regression which attempts to integrate the different socio-economic and demographic factors as well as maternal health related program initiatives by mode of service provider. The analysis strongly brings out the preference for public sector and private sector for seeking maternal services mainly depends on the various socio-economic characterises. Program initiatives clearly demonstrate that accessibility is higher for public sector. However,the improvement in the public sector is stagnating beyond a point across India. Public-private partnership needs to be explored by keeping in mind that the efforts are to be directed more for deprived section of the society.",

    "ab": "IntroductionDyspepsia is a common clinical symptom with prevalence of 5–20% of Outpatient (OPD) consultation at tertiary care hospital. The cause is not detectable in more than half of the patients. The common organic causes include peptic ulcer, esophagitis, and malignancy.AimTo study the clinical profile of patient presenting with dyspepsia in a tertiary care hospital of Assam, and correlate with endoscopic findings.MaterialsThis is a hospital based observational study conducted over an year. Adult patient with dyspepsia was included after informed consent. Clinical data and endoscopic findings of patients with dyspepsia were collected with the help of a structured questionnaire.Results158 patients with dyspepsia were assessed by Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) Endoscopy. Mean age of patient was 40.04 ± 14.3. 70.8% patients were males. 15.19% had history of smoking, 50.06% had history of tobacco consumption, 38.61% were alcoholic and history of NSAID consumption was seen in 9.49%. Alarm symptoms such as weight losss, anemia, UGI bleed were observed in 18.35% patients. Endoscopy revealed normal findings in 43.67% patients. Significant endoscopic findings were diagnosed in 56.32% patients. These included Peptic Ulcer in 25.95%, esophagitis in 4.43%, and UGI malignancy in 3.16%. Other significant lesions constituted less than 2%. Incidence of UGI malignancy was higher in patients more than 50 years. On comparing the endoscopic findings in patients of dyspepsia with alarm symptoms to those of dyspepsia without alarm symptoms, a statistical significance was observed with a p value of 0.013.ConclusionIn patients with dyspepsia presence of alarm symptoms is more significantly associated with organic lesion on endoscopy. Though the incidence of malignancy was low, endoscopy in patients more than 50 years may help in early diagnosis and reduced morbidity of these patients.",

    "ab": "ObjectiveTo assess incidence of spontaneous preterm births and determine biochemical and obstetric risk factors for spontaneous pre-term births in a cohort of antenatal women visiting a secondary care hospital.MethodsA prospective cohort study was designed to include 1420 pregnant women coming for antenatal care at a secondary care hospital. The cohort was followed throughout pregnancy and relevant history, obstetric and ultrasonographic examination and biochemical investigations was carried out in 2nd (20-24 weeks period of gestation) and 3rd trimester (28-32 weeks period of gestation). Outcome of delivery was noted for all the subjects.ResultsA total of 1133 women were recruited. Among the 1071 respondents, 11 had abortions, 93.1% delivered at term while 5.9% had preterm deliveries. Preterm deliveries were noted among 6.5% women with short stature, 13.3% with cervical length <2.5 cms and 5.2% among women with anaemia. Statistically significant association was noted between Oligohydramnios, IUGR and preterm births. Salivary estriol was lower in women who had preterm births as compared to term births.ConclusionsThe incidence of preterm births (5.9%) was low in the present cohort. Oligohydramnios and Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IUGR) were identified as significant risk factors for preterm births. Conventional risk factors like short cervix, short stature and biochemical inflammatory markers were not identified as predictors of prematurity. Lower levels of salivary estriol identified among women at risk of preterm births demonstrates the utility of the test as a non-invasive investigation for early identification of preterm births.",

    "ab": "Problem consideredAs India is considered as the diabetic capital of world, a huge burden of undiagnosed metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a possibility. Early intervention can be planned if MetS can be detected early to avert cardiovascular morbidities.AimsTo assess determinants of MetS amongst population living in Dibrugarh District of Assam.MethodsCommunity based cross-sectional study conducted in Dibrugarh District of Assam, with multistep sampling. Study area, i.e., four rural sub-centres and two urban electoral blocks, were selected randomly. From the list of population of selected area the consenting eligible were included. Sample size was 1700 population with MetS. Socio-demographic information, World Health Organization's Steps questionnaire for behavioural risk factors along with dietary history, anthropometric assessment and laboratory investigations were conducted in three stages. Statistical analysis used: rates, ratio, proportion, univariate and multivariate analysis.ResultsMetS was 47.6% (1606 of 3372 screened) and mean age 47.1 ± 10.9 years. Univariate analysis showed educational status, occupation, family history of hypertension and diabetes, tobacco and alcohol consumption, financial stress, depression, less physical activity, more consumption of meat, fish, egg, diary products, and high-energy food significantly associated with MetS. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed age, education, occupation, computer owner (OR: 3.69, CI: 2.10–6.47, p = 0.000), family history of diabetes (OR: 3.18, CI: 2.10–6.47, p = 0.000), stress (OR: 1.85, CI: 1.45–2.35, p = 0.000), consuming dairy product ≥3 times/week (OR: 2.57, CI: 1.68–3.94, p = 0.000) and nuts and oilseed <3 times/week (OR: 2.37, CI: 1.90–2.96, p = 0.000) have significant association.ConclusionsRisk factors of cardiovascular diseases were rampant amongst persons with MetS. Screening for risk factors amongst them can give opportunity for early intervention.",

    "ab": "ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to evaluate the risk factors in very low birth weight preterm newborns screened for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in a tertiary care hospital and to find the relationship of risk factors to the severity of disease. Very few reports on risk factors of ROP are available from this part of South India.MethodsA prospective screening study was done enrolling 812 preterm babies during the period April 2013 to April 2015 and followed up until maturation of retina or regression of disease. The study population included preterms ≤32 weeks and or ≤1500 g at birth admitted in newborn intensive care unit. Nested case control analysis was done in 203 cases with ROP against a control group of 609 babies. Multivariate analysis of binary logistic regression model was performed by taking ROP as dependent variable and independent variables were those which were found significant (p < 0.05).ResultsOn multivariate analysis apart from low birth weight and low gestational age, risk factors found statistically significant were apnea (p = 0.020), blood transfusion (p = 0.001), hyaline membrane disease (p = 0.035), phototherapy (p = 0.033), ventilator support (p = 0.033) and oxygen use more than seven days (p = 0.007). Factors significantly associated with severity of ROP were oxygen by continuous positive airway pressure (p = 0.02), congenital pneumonia (p = 0.001), shock (p = 0.02), hyaline membrane disease (p = 0.03) and surfactant use (p = 0.003).ConclusionCompromised pulmonary function along with oxygen, surfactant therapy and shock are important risk factors for severe ROP. Antenatal risk factors have no significance in the development of ROP.",

    "ab": "The immature gastrointestinal (GI) tract makes infants vulnerable to transient disorders including colic, gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) and constipation. These conditions cause a significant distress to infants and caregivers, and are among the most common reasons for the paediatrician referral. In addition, these conditions are associated with a significant morbidity, hospitalisations and high healthcare costs, adding to the burden of the disease. Although they are additions to the ongoing physiological development or arise from maladaptive behavioural responses, the evidence remains limited. The vague aetiology and the self-limiting nature, has devoid these conditions of robust clinical attention, both in the research and clinical practice. Frequent early-life intestinal insults may translate as a risk factor in the development of chronic GI disorders and psychological problems later in life. Emerging evidence suggests that providing an optimal nutritional intervention closer to the breast milk can be a path breaking approach to manage these frequently encountered conditions and aid the growth and development of infants.",

    "ab": "Problem consideredLumbar puncture (LP) refusal rates of as high as 30% have been reported in developing countries. Without LP, the patients may suffer suboptimal treatment or unnecessary complications from their disease. Due to a lack of studies exploring the reasons behind this LP refusal, no solution has been suggested to address this problem. Therefore, we carried out this study with the aim of determining knowledge of and attitude towards LP among the public.MethodsA cross-sectional survey study among staff in a public university in Malaysia was conducted using stratified random sampling. Self-administered questionnaires were sent to 500 staff members from April to August 2015. The questionnaire, which included questions on demography, knowledge and attitude towards LP, was pre-tested and validated (Cronbach's alpha = 0.701).ResultsA total of 316 of 500 (63%) responded, of which 294 were complete and analysed. The median (IQR) age was 34 and 65% were female. 80% had tertiary education. The mean knowledge score was 6 ± 3; 74% were categorised into poorly informed, 23% moderately informed, and 3% well-informed. The mean attitude score was 35 ± 4; 3% were categorised as having poor attitude, 72% moderate attitude, and 27% good attitude. Respondents with higher education had a higher knowledge and attitude score (p = 0.001), while respondents afraid of needles had a lower attitude score (p = 0.019). Total knowledge scores and total attitude scores showed a positive correlation (r = 0.272, p = 0.001).ConclusionThe public are not adequately informed about LP, leading to the unreceptive attitudes towards LP consent. Therefore, the public should be educated about LP to create better awareness.",

    "ab": "BackgroundRisk factors for hypertension are increasingly being recognized even in paediatric age group. While clinical manifestations typically appear in adulthood rather than childhood, pathological studies have reported that advanced atherosclerotic lesions are identifiable in young children.MethodsA cluster sample design was adopted. The cluster size was taken as 50. The sample size for cluster sample is calculated taking 95% confidence coefficient and 5% precision, considering a design effect of two where 800 school going adolescent were enrolled from 16 clusters. Socio-demographic, environmental, anthropometric and lab risk factors were assessed in the studied population.ResultsPrevalence of hypertension was 12%. Behavioural risk factor like tobacco user [former (p = 0.008) and currently tobacco users was (p = 0.003)], betel nut users (p = 0.000), alcohol consumers (p = 0.003), feeling of sad or depressed (p = 0.010] and leisure time activity (p = 0.048) extra salt intake with food (p = 0.037), overweight and obesity (p = 0.000) were significantly associated with hypertension.ConclusionHypertension amongst school going adolescent needs to be addressed specially by targeting modifiable risk factors. School based intervention program can be initiated to address the issue.",

    "ab": "Micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs) during early life are associated with adverse outcomes. Globally, iron deficiency is the most common MND and is particularly common in the first two years of life. Iron is crucial for neurodevelopment, cognition, and immunity. The composition of complementary feeds influences the overall health of an infant. Plant-based complementary foods do not provide enough iron to meet the nutrient needs during 6–23 months of age. Furthermore, the quantities of animal-source foods given to infants are generally inadequate to meet the iron gap. To address this issue, the use of iron-fortified complementary foods should be promoted.",

    "ab": "IntroductionWith the increase in widening role of women, need for family planning and contraceptive use is ever increasing. Healthy reproductive and sexual health for many women is still a dream in Northeast India. Bulk of women are unaware about morbidity associated with the contraceptive use as the service providers usually do not provide information on side-effects to the user thus women suffer silently, which ultimately may lead to severe health consequences.ObjectivesPresent study aims to understand the pattern of contraceptive use and morbidity associated with it.MethodsPresent study uses District Level Household and Facility Survey 2012-2013 (DLHS-4) data of seven North-eastern states of India. Only the currently married women (CMW) who are usual resident and not pregnant are retained. Hence a sample of 30,670 CMW are kept for assessing contraceptive use, subsequently 7,825 CMW are filtered for understanding contraceptive morbidity. Statistical technique like Cramer's V and Phi test, and logistic regression are used for the analysis.ResultsResult shows that the percentage of using modern contraceptive method was highest in Sikkim and lowest in Meghalaya. Key findings of the present study are that women with higher parity, having information about side effects and belonging to non-tribal community are more likely to report having contraceptive morbidity, whereas it is opposite for the users of modern spacing methodsConclusionHigher parity women in particular should be provided information about proper use and side-effects of modern contraceptives, so that they can make an informed choice of contraception and lead a healthy life.",

    "ab": "ObjectiveTo assess the views and feedback of trained Map facilitators on content and usability of the Diabetes Conversation Map™ (DCM) education tools.MethodologyThis study included Pakistani trained health care Map facilitators from June 2010 to September 2011. Four separate Map sessions on how Diabetes Works, living with Diabetes, eating healthy & exercising, and starting insulin treatment were facilitated by a trained facilitator. Each 60–90-minute session includes 3–12 trained facilitators. Evaluations were performed after the session through a questionnaire having questions about use of DCM for educating people with diabetes, contents of each Map, role of facilitator, and overall impact of DCM education tools on participating respondent.ResultsOut of 274 HCPs, 94.3% and 96% agreed that it is a better way of patient education and it provides better education as compared to print material respectively. Around 70% and 80% participants agreed that contents of “How Diabetes Works” & “Healthy Eating and exercise” are not difficult for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) respectively while most of the participants (80% and 76.5%) found contents of “Living with Diabetes” and “Starting Insulin” valuable and easy to apprehend. Most of the participants mentioned that self-monitoring of blood glucose, understanding regarding oral hypoglycemic agents, and insulin injecting technique should be included. Majority healthcare providers (80%) were satisfied with facilitation of Expert Trainer.ConclusionMost of the HCPs found DCM as a useful tool for educating people with diabetes. However, some modifications are required to further enhance its effectiveness.",

    "ab": "IntroductionQuite often disease data are available in aggregated formats mostly to maintain confidentiality. This leads to a misalignment problem when the goal is to analyze risk at a different level of spatial resolution different from the original administrative level where data were available.ObjectiveTo estimate and map the risk of measles at a sub-region level in Namibia using data obtained at a regional level.MethodsUsing measles data from Namibia for the period 2005–2014, both multi-step and direct approaches were applied to correct for misalignment. Subsequently, ecological Bayesian regression models were fitted and compared.ResultsResults show that the variables standardized birth rate, counts of measles cases for previous year, unemployment rate and proportion of vaccinated children against measles by age 12 months were significant determinants of measles risk. Constituencies having elevated measles risk were identified mostly in the northern corridor with Angola.ConclusionWe recommend that relevant authorities should make geographical target intervention and redesign prevention and control strategies based on these findings.",

    "ab": "BackgroundLittle research in low and middle-income countries has been conducted on shifts in levels of smoking among those suffering from chronic diseases exposed to cessation messages. We present data on such shifts among diabetes patients participating in a randomized controlled cessation trial in Kerala state, India. The two-arm trial tested the relative effectiveness of diabetes specific cessation messages from doctors and the added value of motivational interviewing by trained cessation counsellors.MethodsTwo hundred twenty-four smokers who participated in the trial were followed for 2 years. Intention to treat analysis documented changes in levels of smoking. We defined low-level smoking as 1-5 sticks per day, medium-level as 6-10 sticks, and high-level as more than 10 sticks. Twenty-three low-level smokers were interviewed about why they continued to smoke, and household response to their smoking.ResultsAt baseline, 32% of the 224 diabetes patients were low-level smokers, 24% medium-level and 44% high-level smokers. At year two 34% of the participants in the trial had quit smoking, 37% were low-level smokers, 16% medium-level smokers and 13% high-level smokers. Forty-nine percent of low-level smokers at baseline continued to smoke at low level. Fifty percent of mid-level and 45% of high-level smokers who did not quit shifted to low level smoking A majority of low-level smokers and their families perceived low-level smoking to be safe.ConclusionsLow level smoking among diabetes patients is common. Proactive and sustained cessation efforts are called for that are attentive to disease complications as teachable moments.",

    "ab": "Nutrition in early life plays vital role in development of metabolic diseases in adulthood, especially obesity and its complications. Conventional infant formulas having protein supply of 55–80% as compared to breastfed infants could enhance early weight gain and later obesity risk. An improved amino acid profile along with a recommended protein quantity of 1.8 g protein per 100 kcal enables whey predominant starter formula to meet requirement of normal term infants during the first four months of life. Therefore infant formulae with reduced protein contents, high protein quality and the whey-predominant are recommended in infants who are not completely breastfed.",

    "ab": "ObjectiveTo determine accuracy of venous plasma glucose (VPG) and capillary blood glucose (CBG) in Gestational diabetes (GD) detection using Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India criteria.MethodsIt was a prospective single arm intervention study. One thousand thirty pregnant women, in second and third trimesters, recruited between June 2014 to March 2015 were included in the study. Seventy-five gram oral glucose was given, irrespective of last meal; venous and capillary blood samples were collected at 2 h. Using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, 2 h VPG level ≥140 mg/dl but <200 mg/dl were labeled as GD; ≥200 mg/dl diabetes mellitus (DM), <140 mg/dl as normal. Correlation between VPG and CBG, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of either for abnormal glycemic profile (GD or DM) were assessed.ResultMean maternal age was 25.8 ± 5.2 years, mean gestational age was 28.9 ± 4.4 weeks and mean body mass index was 25.8 ± 5.1 kg/m2. By WHO criteria, 78 (7.6%) had GD, 14 (1.4%) had DM. Pearson's correlation between VPG and CBG was 0.761 (p < 0.0001). CBG value at 2-h plasma glucose level of ≥140 mg/dl had a sensitivity of 94.87% and specificity of 79.10% with area under receiver operative curve (ROC) 86%.ConclusionNon fasting CBG is useful for screening of abnormal glucose homeostasis in pregnancy.",

    "ab": "IntroductionCommunity acquired pneumonia (CAP) is among the leading causes of death in children under 5 years of age worldwide. In India 15% of child mortality is due to CAP.Aim and objectivesTo enumerate direct and indirect medical expenditures and out of pocket expenditure incurred by parents and to calculate spending burden ratio (SBR) in hospitalized children of severe CAP under 5 years of age.MethodologyProspective observational study conducted in a tertiary care, teaching hospital in India from September 2015 to August 2016 in children aged 1 month to 59 months hospitalized for WHO defined severe CAP. Included were cases treated on any of the following four regimens in first 48 h of admission: Amoxicillin-clavulanate(AC) only, Amoxycillin-clavulanate(AC) with aminoglycoside(A), 3rd generation cephalosporin(3GC) only and 3rd generation cephalosporin plus vancomycin (3GC + V). Clinical and expenditure data was abstracted from hospital chart review and from expenditure diary maintained by parents. SBR was calculated by dividing out of pocket expenditure by mean monthly income of family.ResultsOut of 100 CAP patients recruited (66% were <12 months of age), distribution by antibiotic regime was as follows: AC 14(14%), AC + A 42 (42%), 3GC 18(18%) and 3GC + V 26(26%). History of prior use of antibiotic was present in 78% AC, 62% AC + A, 83% 3GC and 92% 3GC + V regime. Total mean direct expenditure of 100 cases was INR 10381(SD= 7954) of which 72% was incurred as expenditure on drugs and hospital charges. Mean direct medical expenditures was least in AC regime INR 6772(SD = 4808) which was 57% of family’s mean monthly income and most in 3GC + V regime, INR 17088(SD = 9387) being 260% of mean monthly income (p value <0.01). Mean indirect expenditure was similar in all regimes. SBR in AC regime was 0.39, in AC + A regime was 0.36, in 3GC regime was 0.55 and in 3GC + V regime was 1.01. (1 USD = 65 INR)ConclusionIn hospitalized children with CAP, Direct medical expenditure is driven by expenses on drugs and hospital charges.Therefore, reducing these would reduce total medical expenditure and thus financial burden on families of uninsured patients.",

    "ab": "BackgroundA wide variety of speech and language disorders has been known to exist. These disorders impair the ability to communicate to different extent so as to adversely affect social, emotional and functional well-being of a person. In literature, little has been documented about types of various such disorders and their frequency of occurrence. Less is known about pattern of such patients seeking speech language assessment and therapeutic services. Hence need of the present study.MethodData was collected from a total 6707 patients reporting with communication difficulty to Audiology and Speech Language Pathology wing of ENT department, GGS Medical College Hospital, Faridkot, a tertiary care hospital of Punjab, India. Patients' data were classified depending on (a) age, (b) gender, and (c) diagnosis.ResultsMaximum number of patients was aged below 10 years of age which accounted to approximately 43% of the total patients with speech and language difficulties. The number of patients was observed to reduce as age increased. Mis-articulation was most common among all disorders in the first two decades of life where as stuttering was maximally evident in the young age group (21–30 years). Voice related difficulties were most affecting in the middle age groups (31–50 years).ConclusionsResults of the present study would be useful in guiding administrative authorities to establish adequate and suitable infrastructure, employment of disability specific professionals and manpower, proper planning and execution in order to accommodate variety of case load. Awareness program or meetings can be arranged to make the co-professionals (doctors, nurses, and other para-medical staffs) well versed with a Speech Language Pathologist's scope of practice.",

Most of the laboratories do not test for other known causes of ILI, especially in situation like epidemics.ObjectiveIn the present study we detected Influenza and other respiratory viruses in the cases presenting as ILI during a flu epidemic in North India from January to April 2015.Materials and methodsTotal 200 cases, 50 from each month, that were negative for all types of influenza viruses, were randomly selected and tested by Multiplex Real- Time PCR for detection of other respiratory viruses; rhinovirus, adenovirus, Respiratory Syncitial virus (RSV), Human Boca virus (hBoV), Para Influenza viruses 1,2,3, and 4 (PIV 1, PIV 2, PIV 3, PIV 4), measles virus and human Meta Pneumo virus (hMPV).ResultsA total of 28/200 cases (14%) showed presence of other respiratory viruses. Rhinovirus was most commonly detected, (17/200; 8.5%) followed by adenovirus (7/200, 3.5%), RSV (5/200, 2.5%), hBoV (2/200, 1%), and PIV-3 (2/200, 1%). PIV 1, 2, 4, measles and hMPV were not detected in any of the samples.ConclusionEven during an epidemic other respiratory viruses contribute substantially to ILI",

    "ab": "Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram positive coccus, first described from abscesses more than a century ago, is one of the most widely studied bacteria for it's contribution to human disease. About 30% of the population are asymptomatically colonized by this bacteria, most importantly in the anterior nares. The organism survives reasonably well on inanimate surfaces and transfers by contact. Infections with S. aureus are common both in the community and in health care facilities and range from mild skin infections, to soft tissue and bone infections to severe, life threatening pneumonias and bacteraemias. A recent review describes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and management of many of these infections.1Tong S.Y.C. Davis J.S. Eichenberger E. Holland T.L. Fowler V.G. Staphylococcus aureus Infections: epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management.Clin Microbiol Rev. 2015; 28: 603-661https://doi.org/10.1128/CMR.00134-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar Resistance to commonly used antibiotics, especially the beta-lactams in the methicillin resistant S. aureus(MRSA), the threat of vancomycin resistance, the presence of mobile genetic elements which are involved in transmission of multiple antibiotic resistance genes and a host of virulence factors increase the threat presented by this organism. A virulence factor which has seen recent re-interest is the Panton-valentine Leucocidin protein for it's association with community acquired strains.2Shallcross L.J. Fragaszy E. Johnson A.M. Hayward A.C. The role of the Panton-Valentine leucocidin toxin in staphylococcal disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 43-54https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(12)70238-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar The ability of some MRSA clones to spread across countries and continents poses further challenges.3Monecke S. Coombs G. Shore A.C. et al.A Field Guide to Pandemic, Epidemic and Sporadic Clones of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e17936https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017936Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar The World Health Organization has selected Staphylococcus aureus, as one the seven bacteria of international concern, in the first \"Antimicrobial resistance; Global report on surveillance, 2014.4WHO Antimicrobial resistance: global report on surveillance 2014.2014http://www.who.int/drugresistance/documents/surveillancereport/en/onGoogle Scholar While the available data varied widely across regions and countries, MRSA appears to be a global phenomenon. Most WHO regions report 20% MRSA, but the figure rises to 80% in some areas. The paucity of high quality national data is disturbing and for many regions the report has had to rely on publications. A recent article published in this journal, finds MRSA in 22% of 50 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus.5Abulreesh H.H. Organji S.R. Osman G.E.H. Elbanna K. Almalki M.H.K. Ahmad I. Prevalence of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors encoding genes in clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Suadi Arabia.Clin Epidemiol Global Health. 2017; (Available online 9 September 2016)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar However, when isolates only from wound swabs and blood cultures are considered, the MRSA rates go up to 45.5%. While the authors have not discussed the source of isolates in any detail, 24 of their isolates came from nasal swabs, presumably obtained for screening for MRSA carriers. None of these strains carried the mecA gene, but some strains showed resistance to multiple antibiotic groups, as did several isolates from other sources. The 11 phenotypically MRSA strains carried the mec A gene, none of the 50 isolates carried vancomycin resistance genes. The strains have been characterized for some important molecular markers of pathogenicity and virulence. The PVL gene was not detected and about 8% carried the fnBPA gene, a marker for adhesion. The authors have studied a very small number of isolates making it is difficult to infer anything about the epidemiology of MRSA in the region. If the results for the nasal swabs are ignored, they fall short of meeting the general requirement, of at least 30 strains of the same isolate, to obtain a reasonable picture, as has been adopted in the WHO global surveillance report, 2014. While country specific data is not readily accessible, 58(14.8%) of 390 S. aureus strains from various hospitals of the same region were MRSA.6Eed E. Ghonaim M. Hussein Y. Saber T. Khalifa A. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of HA-MRSA in Taif hospitals, Saudi Arabia.J Infect Dev Ctries. 2015; 9: 298-303https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar While the danger of under-reporting MRSA is obvious in the management of the individual patient, the danger of over- representing proportions of antibiotic resistant organisms, based on small prevalence studies, cannot be underestimated. The primary care or even hospital based physician, reading these reports, may be tempted to use higher generation or more broad spectrum antibiotics or antibiotic combinations empirically, especially in countries like ours, where antibiotic usage is mostly unmonitored. Over- representation of resistance data is very likely to occur, if the only source of data continues to be publications. Publication is biased towards new knowledge and positive numbers. Also most such data is generated based on isolates obtained from tertiary teaching hospitals, especially where health systems suffer from poor laboratory services and data gathering mechanisms. Establishing good quality laboratories at various levels of health care, capable of isolating and characterizing at least common aerobic bacteria from clinical samples and having the ability to perform antimicrobial susceptibility using standardized procedures, with a stringent national quality assurance program for reporting laboratories, is the very minimum requirement, in addition to robust reporting mechanisms, for generating true and representative, local area or nation-wide data for antibiotic resistance.",

    "ab": "BackgroundThis study investigated the prevalence of lip and palate clefts, need for reoperation and primary surgery in unrepaired patients younger than 18 years old in Zanjan province, northwest of Iran.MethodsAll urban and rural healthcare centers and the education department of Zanjan province were informed about this project. After identifying all patients with cleft lip and palate, they were sent to the plastic surgery clinic of our hospital. Their data were gathered, including sex, age, clinical classification, surgical modality, complications, surgery satisfaction and un-repaired patients.ResultsA total of 87,356 people were examined by social workers. Among them 120 children and adolescents had cleft lip and palate (1.37 per 1000). 59 (49.1%) patients had cleft lip and palate, 35 (29.1%) patients had only cleft lip and 26 (21.6%) patients had only cleft palate. 25 patients (20.8%) had not done surgery (detection rate was 2.86 per 10,000). Secondary surgery was done in 39 patients (41.05%). In spite of a referral health system in Iran, 25 children with cleft lip had not been operated.ConclusionAlthough most of the identified patients had been operated before, almost half of them had to undergo surgery again. Given the lack of studies on this topic in Iran, our findings can form the basis for further studies to precisely identify the roots of cleft lip and palate and properly plan to decrease its risk factors. Further studies are needed to identify reasons of missed detections and why primary surgeries are not satisfying.",

    "ab": "IntroductionIndia’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) in North 24 Parganas District of West Bengal reported outbreaks of acute diarrhoeal diseases (ADD) during 2010-2014 without laboratory confirmation. Hence, we described the surveillance system and evaluated in terms of selected surveillance attributes: simplicity, acceptability, timeliness of reporting of ADD/outbreaks, representativeness, positive predictive value, usefulness.MethodsWe described the surveillance through review of documents, manuals, records and interview of surveillance staff. For evaluation of the surveillance system, cross sectional study was conducted among 95 sampled Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), 22 Block Medical Officers (BMOHs) of the District and also abstracted data from records. We developed indicators for surveillance attributes and computed proportions for the same. We computed descriptive statistics for timeliness of reporting.ResultsSeventeen percent (n = 15) of first ANMs and six of nineteen medical officers had correct knowledge on ADD case definition. One-fourth of the ANMs reported lack of communication, training, supervision and lack of feedback in preceding six months. Median time taken to intimate district rapid response team (RRT) and to collect specimen from the date of first case reporting was the same day of reporting of index case (Range: 0–2 days vs. 0–3 days) during ADD outbreaks in 2014. Of the five reported ADD outbreaks in 2014, one was laboratory confirmed.ConclusionsKnowledge regarding case definition was poor at all level of health workers. Existing supervision and feedback mechanism needs to be improved. Timeliness of reporting to district RRT and specimen collection during outbreak had improved overtime.",

    "ab": "IntroductionBirth control is an important determinant of maternal survival. Contraceptive use helps the couple to have the desired number of children in the family as well as to practice the desired birth interval between pregnancies.Objectives(1) To study the choices of contraceptive method by working women following the first childbirth. (2) To study the factors influencing the decision making for the contraception by these working women.Materials and methodsA community-based cross sectional study of 178 women from urban and rural parts was done using a semi-structured questionnaire at Udupi taluk, Karnataka. 30 × 7 cluster sampling technique was followed. Systematic random sampling was done to select total 30 clusters from urban and rural areas.ResultsIt was shown that mean age of women was 29 ± 3.516 years, husbands' mean age was 33 ± 4.711. Majority (74.7%) of the women were from rural area. Majority (99.4%) had knowledge of contraceptives but only 43% were practicing contraception. Majority (44.9%) were using copper T. Health concern (60.7%) was the major factor influencing decision making about family planning services. Majority (91.6%) couples took joint decision about contraception.ConclusionAlthough the awareness of contraceptives among working women was high, less than half of the women were practicing contraception. Copper T was used by the majority of working women. Fear of side-effects was the major concern among non-users of contraceptives. Decision making was based on the mutual discussion between the couple.",

    "ab": "BackgroundRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) are gold standard in assessing the effectiveness of a clinical intervention because of their high internal validity. However, the same does not hold true for interventions conducted at the population level like public health interventions. Well-designed RCTs are not easy to conduct at population level. Similarly, well planned, high-quality non-RCTs or observational studies can complement RCTs. Because of this, several systematic reviews of public health interventions are assessed with other study designs, namely non-RCTs and observational studies. In such situations, studies of similar study design are pooled together to obtain an overall effect estimate. This is inevitable, because the principle of meta-analysis does not offer an opportunity for combining effect estimates coming from various study designs. If the meta-analysis performed for each study design provides contrasting results, then this introduces a quandary for the decision makers and public health policy makers to call for a decision.ObjectiveThe present study aims to integrate the results coming from a variety of study designs in order to obtain a single estimate of effect of intervention.MethodologyBayesian approach to meta-analysis was used by formulating prior distribution from observational studies or non-RCTs and likelihood function from RCTs. Five systematic reviews of public health intervention were used to demonstrate the methodology.Results/conclusionsBy formulating prior distribution from observational studies, the posterior estimates were found to be different than that from the results of RCTs or other study designs. The posterior pooled-estimate was found to be precise and the width of the credible interval narrowed. Inclusion of the relevant observational studies (or non-RCTs) in the systematic review is a potential advantage for evaluating the effectiveness of public health intervention.",

    "ab": "PurposePelvic organs are naturally prone to positional and volumetric changes over time. These individual organ changes may result in variations in the clinical target volume (CTV) position and shape. Planning target volume (PTV) that encompasses the CTV with some margins to account for such uncertainties in patient positioning, organ motion, and beam geometry is universally accepted today in radiotherapy. Keeping this view in mind, the present study has been planned in order to determine the setup error (random and systematic) in patients of carcinoma cervix and rectum image-guided radiotherapy and to propose a population-based three-dimensional CTV to PTV margins in IGRT scenario.Materials and methodsThe mean margin displacements of 61 patients measured through different directions. The proposed method is used to estimate margins of displacement of specific CTV dosing. A further method is illustrated to simulate the dose received by the CTV. The margin distance compared with Van Herk model through consideration of systematic and random errors. Different site-wise displacements were measured and compared. The CTV performance dosimetry has been carried through proposed model and compared with the traditional margin for each of the datasets.ResultsThe PTV margins obtained on lateral, longitudinal and vertical sides on Cervix site are 0.91, 1.93 and 0.96 [Van Hark's formula] and 0.84, 1.79 and 0.89 through proposed formula. It can be noted that in both the cases, the respective margin obtained through proposed method was lesser in comparison to that of Van Hark's method.ConclusionsThe presence of heterogeneity in patient's random error is natural. This random error is highly influential on radiotherapy margin widths of the patients. The Bayesian statistics are useful to deal with such a problem. In this article, a simple and well-defined model is adopted to deal with the patient's heterogeneity problem. It has been observed that the model accounted the variability in the margin estimation. The variation in margin can be extended from one cancer site to another cancer site.",

    "ab": "ObjectiveThe primary objective was to predict onset of remission within 10 days of starting corticosteroid treatment in nephrotic syndrome patients aged between 2 and 10 years (either first episode or first relapse) using clinical and laboratory variables. The secondary objective was to compare changes in CD4 count and percentage among newly diagnosed cases.MethodProspective cohort study with a nested case–control design was conducted from September 2009 to August 2010 after institutional ethical clearance. Included were cases aged 2–10 years diagnosed as nephrotic syndrome based on standard clinical and laboratory criteria. Controls were age- and sex-matched healthy subjects recruited from the outpatient's department.ResultsIncluded were 44 cases (26 newly diagnosed and 16 were first relapse) cases of nephrotic syndrome and 38 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Variables in the linear regression model predicting remission were sex, presence of tuberculosis, Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)/High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) ratio and antihypertensive medication, serum LDL, serum triglyceride, and serum creatinine. CD4 count, CD4%, and CD4% rise were significantly high in first episode of nephrotic syndrome as compared to controls. Serum Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) was raised in late responders of first episode of nephrotic syndrome.ConclusionFemale gender, concomitant tuberculosis, and raised serum VLDL delayed onset of remission while use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertensive patients decreased the duration of proteinuria in cases of nephrotic syndrome in children.",

    "ab": "The field of medical geographic information systems (Medical GIS) has become extremely useful in understanding the bigger picture of public health. The discipline holds a substantial capacity to understand not only differences, but also similarities in population health all over the world. The main goal of marrying the disciplines of medical geography, public health and informatics is to understand how countless health issues impact populations, and the trends by which these populations are affected. From the 1990s to today, this practical approach has become a valued and progressive system in analyzing medical and epidemiological phenomena ranging from cholera to cancer.1Glass G.E. Aron J.L. Ellis J.H. Yoon S.S. Applications of GIS Technology to Disease Control. The John Hopkins University, School of Hygiene and Public health, 1993Google Scholar, 2Chaikaew N. Tripathi N.K. Souris M. Exploring spatial patterns and hotspots of diarrhea in Chiang Mai, Thailand.Int J Health Geogr. 2009; 8: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar The instruments supporting this field include geographic information systems (GIS), disease surveillance, big data, and analytical approaches like the Geographical Analysis Machine (GAM), Dynamic Continuous Area Space Time Analysis (DYCAST), cellular automata, agent based modeling, spatial statistics and self organizing maps. In the present work, the spatio-temporal pattern of acute diarrheal disease (ADD) is studied in Chennai during the years 2009–2011.3Kumar V.S. Devika S. George S. Jeyaseelan L. Spatial mapping of acute diarrheal disease using GIS and estimation of relative risk using empirical Bayes approach.Clin Epidemiol Global Health. 2016; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2016.07.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (14) Google Scholar GIS is used to map ADD data ward-wise. There is very large variation in the cumulative incidence rate of ADD between 155 wards with a minimum of 0 cases/100,000 per year to a maximum of 1699.7 cases/100,000 per year. The variation in incidence rate is also evident among different age groups as well as among different seasons. Higher incidence is prevailed in northern part of Chennai near Coastal area. A common index of disease incidence and morbidity is the standardized morbidity ratio (SMR). The SMR is a reliable measure of relative risk for large geographical regions such as countries or states, but may be unreliable for small areas such as municipal wards.3Kumar V.S. Devika S. George S. Jeyaseelan L. Spatial mapping of acute diarrheal disease using GIS and estimation of relative risk using empirical Bayes approach.Clin Epidemiol Global Health. 2016; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2016.07.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (14) Google Scholar This paper reviews two empirical Bayes methods for producing smoothed estimates of the SMR. A multilevel Poisson gamma and Poisson lognormal model with covariates is developed, and estimating functions are used to estimate model parameters. The authors are using SMR and the relative risk inadvertently. Since SMR is being used as an estimate of the relative risk under consideration, only SMR should have been used in order to avoid any kind of confusion. Spatial analysis methods in GIS revealed the spatial patterns and hotspots of ADD in Chennai from the year 2009 to 2011. To implement specific and geographically appropriate public health risk reduction programs, the use of such spatial analysis tools may become an integral component in the epidemiologic description, analysis, and risk assessment of diarrhea. The positive effects on disease mapping have proven to be tremendous as these instruments continue to have a great impact on the mission to improve worldwide health care. While traditional uses of GIS in public health are static and lacking real time components, implementing a space time animation in these instruments will be monumental as technology and data continue to grow.4Meza J.L.

The randomized response (RR) procedure gives confidence to the interviewee that his/her information on private (sensitive variable) is protected. In general, a simple random sampling (SRS) with replacement design is used for selecting a sample. We develop a model for the estimation of the variance of sensitive variable in randomized response procedure, when ranked set sampling (RSS) design is used under ranking criteria. The usual gain in accuracy related to the use of ranked set sampling is revealed. The performance of the proposed model is demonstrated using data provided by a study of samples of persons infected with AIDS disease.",

    "ab": "Problem consideredCervical cancer, mainly caused by human papillomavirus infection, is one of the most frequent cancers in women in the developing world including India. The present study attempts to explore the risk factors related to symptoms of cervical cancer.Materials and methodsA total of 1319 females of age groups ranging from 14 years to 85 years were included in the present study and analyzed for symptoms and risk factors for cervical cancer.ResultsThe prevalence of painful micturition, white discharge per vagina, and pelvic pain in the age group 25–44 years was found to be 22.1%, 21%, and 8%, respectively, and the distribution of symptoms was statistically associated (p < 0.05) with age. Chances of developing painful micturition were significantly related to age group 45–54 years (AOR = 2.5; 95% C.I.: 1.4–4.5), while the likelihood of developing pelvic pain was significantly related to the females of age groups of below 25 years (AOR = 8.4; 95% C.I.: 1.4–12.1) and 25–34 years (AOR = 7.9; 95% C.I.: 1.7–8.3). Pelvic pain was also independently related to the abnormal age of menarche (≤11 or ≥16 years) (AOR = 3.6; 95% C.I.: 1.6–8.5) concerning the standard age of start.ConclusionsFindings of the study indicate that there is lack of awareness about the key risk factors for cervical cancer among women that pointed out the issue of limited knowledge which may work as an obstacle in health services utilization.",

    "ab": "QuestionFrom previous work, this group had discovered that infection of dendritic cells (DC) caused by the intracellular parasite (Toxoplasma gondii) induced a hyper-migratory state in DC which was a possible mechanism of the protozoan dissemination. For this study, their question was whether ϒ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling was the possible mechanism underlying the control to the migratory properties of the infected DC.MethodsTo affirm the hypothesis, a series of complimentary experiments were conducted using both animal and human DC, also in vitro and in vivo.Main resultsThe main results of the experiments were as follows:First, murine and human DC produced GABA upon T. gondii infection. By quantitatively measuring GABA in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), they found that live Toxoplasma infection of mouse DC, from the three predominant genotypes, increased GABA and the secretion occurred rapidly following infection. In addition, the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of infected DC populations demonstrated that GABA production happened mainly in green fluorescent protein (GFP) + DC.Second, functional GABAA receptors were expressed in mouse and human DC. The GABAA receptors of a3, ß3, and r1 subunit expression was determined with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase reaction (RT-qPCR). Subsequent immune-cytochemical stainings indicated expression of the ß3 subunit in both infected and non infected DC. These receptors were proved to be functional in the electrophysiology tests as membrane currents were induced in T. gondii-infected DC.Third, transmigration of infected DC in vitro was reduced by targeting GABA synthesis and transport. Addition of inhibitors of GABA system such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) inhibitor (SC) and gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter 4 (GAT4) inhibitor (SNAP) to the infected DC had significantly decreased the secretion of GABA and also the transmigration of infected DC.Fourth, the motility and chemotaxis of infected DC in vitro was modulated by GABAergic signaling in vitro. In a chemotaxis chamber system which consisted of chemokine CCL19 concentration gradient, Toxoplasma-infected DC demonstrated an increased random directional motility and velocity even in absence of chemokine compared to non-infected DC.Finally, up-regulation of CCR7 in human and mouse DC were observed upon T. gondii infection in vitro. Furthermore, the dissemination of T. gondii in vivo was reduced by GABAergic inhibition in adoptively transferred infected DC as shown in the bioluminescence imaging (BLI) studies. Photonic emissions were also observed ex vivo in different organs, and the authors noted significant differences in the emissions on days 1–2 in the brain parenchyma.ConclusionThe authors concluded that GABAergic signaling modulated the transmigration of DC and that the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii seizes the GABAergic signaling of DC like a trojan horse mechanism to assure dissemination.",

    "ab": "I did my medical schooling from Kasturba Medical College, Manipal. Our institution encouraged us to apply and do an elective, which is an optional course selected by the student, in another country. Hence I applied to a couple of institutions in the United Kingdom for electives in the final year of my medical graduate school. The Department of Cardiovascular Medicine in the John Radcliff Hospital, University of Oxford, accepted my application for a 4- week elective. I spent a month in the late winter of 2015 there. I am documenting a modified version of the feedback submitted to the Oxford University after returning back to India, as well as sharing my experiences.1.What would be your advice for another student doing an elective period at Oxford?My advice for a student planning to do an elective period at oxford would be a couple of things. First, the student must read about Oxford and Oxford University, study the maps available on the net and get familiarized with the place. It is also advisable to access information of various events, academic and cultural, planned there in the duration of the stay so that s/he can decide on which ones to attend.Oxford University as an “e-buddy” program where regular students are linked through e-mail with International students to welcome them and provide friendly advice about settling in Oxford elective program before arrival. This is a very useful program but one has to know about it and fill the application for an e-buddy well in advance. After arriving in Oxford, the most important thing is to identify and befriend the other elective as well as regular students in the course. These are the people with whom the student would be spending most of his/her time and, since they are peer learners, learning will be enriched by this association.2.What would be your advice for a student from Oxford doing an elective in your country?What would be your advice for a student from Oxford doing an elective in your country?For a student from Oxford doing an elective in India would be really good because here, there is exposure to a lot of clinical cases, including those seldom seen in the UK, as well as to a culture that is diverse. This can be appreciated by those who have had first-hand experience. The student must be ready for a sudden change in not only the surroundings, but also the work environment, and the medical care system. In United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS), is an organized government owned system.[1]Grosios K. Gahan P.B. Burbidge J. Overview of healthcare in the UK.EPMA J. 2010; 1: 529-534https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-010-0050-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar NHS is totally financed by the government. All health services are provided free of cost to the citizens of UK. Services obtained in the private sector are covered by health insurance schemes opted by the patients. On the other hand, Indian health system is complex. Government hospitals provide subsidized health care and are overcrowded. Often, the quality of services are compromised because of lack of resources. In the private sector cost of medical care is high. In absence of viable health insurance programs, the patients have to pay out of pocket for health care expenses.Students would often encounter differences in the teaching-learning methods in Indian schools. In India, a typical batch of students in clinical rounds is large, with an average of 30+ students. In Oxford, I was in clinical round with small batches of about 5 students. The teaching there was interactive and each of us got personalized attention. I also learned subtle aspects of professionalism while observing patient-health care provider interactions in Oxford. In India, professionalims and medical ethics must be taught as a formal curriculum as is done in the UK. I observed meticulous documenation of patient care instructions during ward rounds followed by exact implemention. Management orders were given by a senior consultant who discussed them with us. Evidence based guidelines were followed in Oxford and the hospital had stringent policy for antibiotic use. In India implementation of management guidelines as well as strenthening documenation would surely result in better quality of care. The only deterent is, in my view, increased number of patient to doctor ratio and deficient support from paramedical and nursing staff in India [2]Deo M.G. Doctor population ratio for India-The reality.IJMR. 2013; 137: 632-635PubMed Google Scholar In view of differences in the health care system and medical education program, I recommend groups of at least two or three to come to India at a time.3.Are there any lessons in healthcare your country could learn from Oxford?From what I saw in Oxford, I appreciated centralized approach to the health care system with health insurance coverage for patients. India has to plan to revamp its health care system and provide health insurance to ensure quality in care. University of Oxford is involved in many collaborative clinical studies and trials with many Institutions across the world. I had oppurtunity to hear presenation from several such works conducted in Nepal, Africa and South America. Such collaborative research helps not only the country involved, but also contributes to improve the standards of medical care and research in Oxford. Researchers and clinicians in Oxford were encouraged to innovate, strive for excellence and benefit stakeholders.[3]Atun R. Health systems, systems thining and innovation.Health Policy Plan. 2012; 27 (iv4-iv8)https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czs088Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar The approach to innovation as a whole is something I would like to see in the healthcare and medical education of my country.4.Are there any lessons in healthcare Oxford could learn from your country?The healthcare in the UK and Oxford has evolved over time and has been established as one of the leading models in the world. Patient management in Oxford is technology driven and often “bound” by guidelines. In contrast, in India patient management is based on clinical acumen and experience of the physician, in absence of stringent guidelines. This gives flexibility and learning oppurtunity to the physician. Physicians from Oxford can be benefitted by exposure to personalised management protocols followed in India. This gives an oppurtunity for self directed, experiential learning.",

    "ab": "Background to the change in authorship: This paper was submitted on 20 September 2013, by:•Authors: Mala Kumar, Shalini Tripathi, Neha Agarwal, S.N. Singh Department of Pediatrics, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. The manuscript was Accepted 21 January 2014. Available online 17 March 2014. Thereafter Dr. Neha Agarwal, on April 7, 2017, appealed to the journal that this publication was from her post-graduate thesis work under the chief supervisor Prof. Mala Kumar and co-supervisor Prof. S.N. Singh. Dr. Neha Agarwal had formulated the idea of writing research paper from her thesis. However the manuscript was written after she had completed her residency and left the department. The prime mover for thesis writing was her Chief Supervisor, Prof. Mala Kumar. Since this work was from the postgraduate thesis of Dr. Neha Agarwal she claimed to first authorship, which was accepted by the corresponding author Prof. Mala Kumar. There was a change in authorship while the paper essentially contained the same information on the same topic as submitted in the first version. It appears that the work was done primarily by Dr. Neha Agarwal under supervision of Prof. Mala Kumar and Prof. S.N. Singh. Dr. Shalini Tripathi assisted in reanalysis, interpretation and manuscript writing in absence of Dr. Neha Agarwal.",

    "ab": "BackgroundOn 10th November 2014 health workers from Bardhwaja village informed district surveillance unit, Howrah, about suspected measles outbreak. We investigated it to confirm etiology, estimated coverage and effectiveness of MCV.MethodWe conducted a retrospective cohort study among 0–15 years’ children (n = 613). We did house-to-house survey to identify measles cases, defined as occurrence of fever with rash with one of the three: cough, coryza, conjunctivitis. We tested blood samples from 8 case-patients. We described the distribution of case-patients by time, place and person. We estimated the coverage (and 95% CI) of MCV and compared the attack rate (AR) among vaccinated and unvaccinated children to estimate effectiveness of MCV.ResultWe identified 68 measles case-patients (AR: 11.1%, no death). All sera were positive for IgM measles antibodies. Cases started occurring from 2nd week of September, peaked during October and declined during November. Median age of case-patients was 84 months (IQR: 54–114 months); Vaccine coverage of MCV1 among 9 months to 15 years’ children was 64.8% (379/584) and that of MCV2 among 16 months to 5 years’ children was (62/98) 63.2%. Compared to unvaccinated children, those who received one (RR: 0.16, 95% CI 0.09–0.2) and two doses (RR: 0.09, 95% CI 0.02–0.4) of measles vaccine were at lower risk. The risk of measles was higher among children of religious minority (RR: 28.3, 95% CI 7–114.5). Vaccine Effectiveness of one and two doses of measles vaccine was 83.4% (95% CI 71.2–90.4) and 90.32% (95% CI 59.2–97.7) respectively.ConclusionMCV coverage in Bardwaja was low. We recommended strengthening of outreach immunization targeting religious minority.",

    "ab": "IntroductionThe objective of this study was to estimate the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus carriers among the health care personnel in General Surgery and Orthopaedics Departments of Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram and also to estimate the proportion of methicillin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among them.MethodsAll the health care personnel in General Surgery and Orthopaedics Departments of Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, who were willing to take part in the study and gave consent were recruited. A semi structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Nasal swabs from both nostrils and hand impression specimens from both hands were obtained and cultured on blood agar and MacConkey agar plates for detection of Staphylococcus aureus, followed by antibiotic sensitivity testing. MRSA was confirmed with Hichrome agar.ResultsOut of the 341 subjects, 125 (36.7%) tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus, and 10 (2.93%) tested positive for MRSA. All 10 study participants were from the surgery department.ConclusionMore than one-third of the healthcare personnel were found to be carriers of Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of 2.93% of healthcare personnel being carriers of MRSA is a cause of concern. The causes of personnel from only one department being found to be carriers, need to be evaluated further for finding the determinants of such carrier state.",
