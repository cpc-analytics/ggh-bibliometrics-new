    "ab": "Antibiotic use in human medicine, veterinary medicine, and agriculture has been linked to the rise of antibiotic resistance globally. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the effect that interventions to reduce antibiotic use in food-producing animals have on the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animals and in humans.On July 14, 2016, we searched electronic databases (Agricola, AGRIS, BIOSIS Previews, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Index Medicus, ProQuest Dissertations, Science Citation Index) and the grey literature. The search was updated on Jan 27, 2017. Inclusion criteria were original studies that reported on interventions to reduce antibiotic use in food-producing animals and compared presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria between intervention and comparator groups in animals or in human beings. We extracted data from included studies and did meta-analyses using random effects models. The main outcome assessed was the risk difference in the proportion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.A total of 181 studies met inclusion criteria. Of these, 179 (99%) described antibiotic resistance outcomes in animals, and 81 (45%) of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. 21 studies described antibiotic resistance outcomes in humans, and 13 (62%) of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled absolute risk reduction of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in animals with interventions that restricted antibiotic use commonly ranged between 10 and 15% (total range 0-39), depending on the antibiotic class, sample type, and bacteria under assessment. Similarly, in the human studies, the pooled prevalence of antibiotic resistance reported was 24% lower in the intervention groups compared with control groups, with a stronger association seen for humans with direct contact with food-producing animals.Interventions that restrict antibiotic use in food-producing animals are associated with a reduction in the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in these animals. A smaller body of evidence suggests a similar association in the studied human populations, particularly those with direct exposure to food-producing animals. The implications for the general human population are less clear, given the low number of studies. The overall findings have directly informed the development of WHO guidelines on the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals.World Health Organization.",

    "ab": "Climate change can directly affect human health by varying exposure to non-optimal outdoor temperature. However, evidence on this direct impact at a global scale is limited, mainly due to issues in modelling and projecting complex and highly heterogeneous epidemiological relationships across different populations and climates.We collected observed daily time series of mean temperature and mortality counts for all causes or non-external causes only, in periods ranging from Jan 1, 1984, to Dec 31, 2015, from various locations across the globe through the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network. We estimated temperature-mortality relationships through a two-stage time series design. We generated current and future daily mean temperature series under four scenarios of climate change, determined by varying trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions, using five general circulation models. We projected excess mortality for cold and heat and their net change in 1990-2099 under each scenario of climate change, assuming no adaptation or population changes.Our dataset comprised 451 locations in 23 countries across nine regions of the world, including 85 879 895 deaths. Results indicate, on average, a net increase in temperature-related excess mortality under high-emission scenarios, although with important geographical differences. In temperate areas such as northern Europe, east Asia, and Australia, the less intense warming and large decrease in cold-related excess would induce a null or marginally negative net effect, with the net change in 2090-99 compared with 2010-19 ranging from -1Â·2% (empirical 95% CI -3Â·6 to 1Â·4) in Australia to -0Â·1% (-2Â·1 to 1Â·6) in east Asia under the highest emission scenario, although the decreasing trends would reverse during the course of the century. Conversely, warmer regions, such as the central and southern parts of America or Europe, and especially southeast Asia, would experience a sharp surge in heat-related impacts and extremely large net increases, with the net change at the end of the century ranging from 3Â·0% (-3Â·0 to 9Â·3) in Central America to 12Â·7% (-4Â·7 to 28Â·1) in southeast Asia under the highest emission scenario. Most of the health effects directly due to temperature increase could be avoided under scenarios involving mitigation strategies to limit emissions and further warming of the planet.This study shows the negative health impacts of climate change that, under high-emission scenarios, would disproportionately affect warmer and poorer regions of the world. Comparison with lower emission scenarios emphasises the importance of mitigation policies for limiting global warming and reducing the associated health risks.UK Medical Research Council.",

    "ab": "BackgroundClimate change is a major global public health priority. The delivery of health-care services generates considerable greenhouse gas emissions. Operating theatres are a resource-intensive subsector of health care, with high energy demands, consumable throughput, and waste volumes. The environmental impacts of these activities are generally accepted as necessary for the provision of quality care, but have not been examined in detail. In this study, we estimate the carbon footprint of operating theatres in hospitals in three health systems.MethodsSurgical suites at three academic quaternary-care hospitals were studied over a 1-year period in Canada (Vancouver General Hospital, VGH), the USA (University of Minnesota Medical Center, UMMC), and the UK (John Radcliffe Hospital, JRH). Greenhouse gas emissions were estimated using primary activity data and applicable emissions factors, and reported according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.FindingsSite greenhouse gas evaluations were done between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 2011. The surgical suites studied were found to have annual carbon footprints of 5 187 936 kg of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) at JRH, 4 181 864 kg of CO2e at UMMC, and 3 218 907 kg of CO2e at VGH. On a per unit area basis, JRH had the lowest carbon intensity at 1702 kg CO2e/m2, compared with 1951 kg CO2e/m2 at VGH and 2284 kg CO2e/m2 at UMMC. Based on case volumes at all three sites, VGH had the lowest carbon intensity per operation at 146 kg CO2e per case compared with 173 kg CO2e per case at JRH and 232 kg CO2e per case at UMMC. Anaesthetic gases and energy consumption were the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Preferential use of desflurane resulted in a ten-fold difference in anaesthetic gas emissions between hospitals. Theatres were found to be three to six times more energy-intense than the hospital as a whole, primarily due to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning requirements. Overall, the carbon footprint of surgery in the three countries studied is estimated to be 9Â·7 million tonnes of CO2e per year.InterpretationOperating theatres are an appreciable source of greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions reduction strategies including avoidance of desflurane and occupancy-based ventilation have the potential to lessen the climate impact of surgical services without compromising patient safety.FundingNone.",

    "ab": "A new model of human wellbeing is emerging to guide humanity in the Anthropocene. In essence, it recognises that wellbeing depends on enabling every person to lead a life of dignity and opportunity, while safeguarding the integrity of Earth's life-supporting systems. The conceptual framework of social and planetary boundariesâwhich has come to be known as the Doughnutâcontributes to this paradigm by concisely visualising its ambition (appendix), and so providing a compass for humanity's 21st century progress. Since I created the Doughnut at Oxfam in 2012,1Raworth K A safe and just space for humanity: can we live within the doughnut?.https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/dp-a-safe-and-just-space-for-humanity-130212-en.pdfDate: 2012Google Scholar it has been widely applied within academia, policymaking, progressive business, urban planning, and civil society as a tool for reconceptualising sustainable development.2Dearing J Wang R Zhang K et al.Safe and just operating spaces for regional social-ecological systems.Glob Environ Change. 2014; 28: 227-238Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 3Costanza R Alperovitz A Daly HE et al.Building a sustainable and desirable economy-in-society-in-nature, United Nations Division for Sustainable Development.https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/Building_a_Sustainable_and_Desirable_Economy-in-Society-in-Nature.pdfDate: 2012Google Scholar, 4Article 13.

The Doughnut combines two concentric radar charts to depict the two boundariesâsocial and ecologicalâthat together encompass human wellbeing (figure). The inner boundary is a social foundation, below which lie shortfalls in wellbeing, such as hunger, ill health, illiteracy, and energy poverty. Its twelve dimensions and their illustrative indicators are derived from internationally agreed minimum standards for human wellbeing, as established in 2015 by the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by all member states of the United Nations.7UN Department of Economic and Social AffairsSustainable development goals.https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300Google Scholar The Doughnut's outer boundary is an ecological ceiling, beyond which lies an overshoot of pressure on Earth's life-supporting systems, such as climate change, ocean acidification, and biodiversity loss. Its nine dimensions and their indicators are defined by the planetary boundaries framework, which seeks to identify and safeguard critical processes that regulate Earth's ability to sustain Holocene-like conditions, and this framework was likewise revised in 2015.8Steffen W Richardson K RockstrÃ¶m J et al.Planetary boundaries: guiding human development on a changing planet.Science. 2015; 347: 736Crossref Scopus (5194) Google Scholar Between these two sets of boundaries lies an ecologically safe and socially just space in which all of humanity has the chance to thrive (appendix). By quantifying and visualising the global scale of shortfalls and overshoot, the Doughnut acts as a concise compass for assessment of the current state of human wellbeing (the appendix contains the full data and methods). Millions of people currently lead lives that fall far short of the social foundation's internationally agreed minimum standards, ranging from nutrition and health care to housing, income, and energy. At the same time, human activity has led to overshoot for at least four planetary boundaries: climate change, biodiversity loss, nitrogen and phosphorus loading, and land conversion. Improving humanity's wellbeing this century depends on eliminating this social shortfall and ecological overshoot simultaneously (figure). The Doughnut raises four key implications for the pursuit of human wellbeing in the Anthropocene. First, it highlights the dependence of human wellbeing on planetary health. The Holocene is the only epoch in Earth's history in which it is known that humanity can thrive.9RockstrÃ¶m J Steffen W Noone K et al.Planetary boundaries: exploring the safe operating space for humanity.Nature. 2009; 461: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (6757) Google Scholar The best chance of enabling a life of dignity and opportunity for more than 10 billion people over the coming century therefore depends on sustaining Holocene-like conditions, such as a stable climate, clean air, a protective ozone layer, thriving biodiversity, and healthy oceans. Second, the concurrent extent of social shortfall and ecological overshoot reflects deep inequalitiesâof income and wealth, of exposure to risk, of gender and race, and of political powerâboth within and between countries. The Doughnut helps to focus attention on addressing such inequalities when both theorising and pursuing human wellbeing. Third, the Doughnut implies the need for a deep renewal of economic theory and policymaking so that the continued widespread political prioritisation of gross domestic product growth is replaced by an economic vision that seeks to transform economies, from local to global, so that they become regenerative and distributive by design, and thus help to bring humanity into the Doughnut.10Raworth K Doughnut economics: seven ways to think like a 21st century economist. Penguin Random House, London2017Google Scholar Last, the Doughnut might act as a 21st century compass, but the greater task is to create an effective map of the terrain ahead. Thanks to ongoing socioecological systems research, this century is likely to be the first in which humanity begins more fully to understand and appreciate the complex interdependence of human wellbeing and planetary health. I received a grant from The Kendeda Fund to write and promote my book, Doughnut Economics: seven ways to think like a 21st century economist, on which this comment is based.

    "ab": "BackgroundInformation about the global structure of agriculture and nutrient production and its diversity is essential to improve present understanding of national food production patterns, agricultural livelihoods, and food chains, and their linkages to land use and their associated ecosystems services. Here we provide a plausible breakdown of global agricultural and nutrient production by farm size, and also study the associations between farm size, agricultural diversity, and nutrient production. This analysis is crucial to design interventions that might be appropriately targeted to promote healthy diets and ecosystems in the face of population growth, urbanisation, and climate change.MethodsWe used existing spatially-explicit global datasets to estimate the production levels of 41 major crops, seven livestock, and 14 aquaculture and fish products. From overall production estimates, we estimated the production of vitamin A, vitamin B12, folate, iron, zinc, calcium, calories, and protein. We also estimated the relative contribution of farms of different sizes to the production of different agricultural commodities and associated nutrients, as well as how the diversity of food production based on the number of different products grown per geographic pixel and distribution of products within this pixel (Shannon diversity index [H]) changes with different farm sizes.FindingsGlobally, small and medium farms (â¤50 ha) produce 51â77% of nearly all commodities and nutrients examined here. However, important regional differences exist. Large farms (>50 ha) dominate production in North America, South America, and Australia and New Zealand. In these regions, large farms contribute between 75% and 100% of all cereal, livestock, and fruit production, and the pattern is similar for other commodity groups. By contrast, small farms (â¤20 ha) produce more than 75% of most food commodities in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, south Asia, and China. In Europe, west Asia and north Africa, and central America, medium-size farms (20â50 ha) also contribute substantially to the production of most food commodities. Very small farms (â¤2 ha) are important and have local significance in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, and south Asia, where they contribute to about 30% of most food commodities. The majority of vegetables (81%), roots and tubers (72%), pulses (67%), fruits (66%), fish and livestock products (60%), and cereals (56%) are produced in diverse landscapes (H>1Â·5). Similarly, the majority of global micronutrients (53â81%) and protein (57%) are also produced in more diverse agricultural landscapes (H>1Â·5). By contrast, the majority of sugar (73%) and oil crops (57%) are produced in less diverse ones (Hâ¤1Â·5), which also account for the majority of global calorie production (56%). The diversity of agricultural and nutrient production diminishes as farm size increases. However, areas of the world with higher agricultural diversity produce more nutrients, irrespective of farm size.InterpretationOur results show that farm size and diversity of agricultural production vary substantially across regions and are key structural determinants of food and nutrient production that need to be considered in plans to meet social, economic, and environmental targets. At the global level, both small and large farms have key roles in food and nutrition security. Efforts to maintain production diversity as farm sizes increase seem to be necessary to maintain the production of diverse nutrients and viable, multifunctional, sustainable landscapes.FundingCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CGIAR Research Programs on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security and on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health funded by the CGIAR Fund Council, Daniel and Nina Carasso Foundation, European Union, International Fund for Agricultural Development, Australian Research Council, National Science Foundation, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate ChangeâBelmont Forum.",

    "ab": "The observed increase in the effects on human beings of weather-related disasters has been largely attributed to the rise in population exposed, with a possible influence of global warming. Yet, future risks of weather-related hazards on human lives in view of climate and demographic changes have not been comprehensively investigated.We assessed the risk of weather-related hazards to the European population in terms of annual numbers of deaths in 30 year intervals relative to the reference period (1981-2010) up to the year 2100 (2011-40, 2041-70, and 2071-100) by combining disaster records with high-resolution hazard and demographic projections in a prognostic modelling framework. We focused on the hazards with the greatest impacts-heatwaves and cold waves, wildfires, droughts, river and coastal floods, and windstorms-and evaluated their spatial and temporal variations in intensity and frequency under a business-as-usual scenario of greenhouse gas emissions. We modelled long-term demographic dynamics through a territorial modelling platform to represent the evolution of human exposure under a corresponding middle-of-the-road socioeconomic scenario. We appraised human vulnerability to weather extremes on the basis of more than 2300 records collected from disaster databases during the reference period and assumed it to be static under a scenario of no adaptation.We found that weather-related disasters could affect about two-thirds of the European population annually by the year 2100 (351 million people exposed per year [uncertainty range 126 million to 523 million] during the period 2071-100) compared with 5% during the reference period (1981-2010; 25 million people exposed per year). About 50 times the number of fatalities occurring annually during the reference period (3000 deaths) could occur by the year 2100 (152 000 deaths [80 500-239 800]). Future effects show a prominent latitudinal gradient, increasing towards southern Europe, where the premature mortality rate due to weather extremes (about 700 annual fatalities per million inhabitants [482-957] during the period 2071-100 vs 11 during the reference period) could become the greatest environmental risk factor. The projected changes are dominated by global warming (accounting for more than 90% of the rise in risk to human beings), mainly through a rise in the frequency of heatwaves (about 2700 heat-related fatalities per year during the reference period vs 151 500 [80 100-239 000] during the period 2071-100).Global warming could result in rapidly rising costs of weather-related hazards to human beings in Europe unless adequate adaptation measures are taken. Our results could aid in prioritisation of regional investments to address the unequal burden of effects on human beings of weather-related hazards and differences in adaptation capacities.European Commission.",

    "ab": "Findings from published studies suggest that exposure to and interactions with green spaces are associated with improved psychological wellbeing and have cognitive, physiological, and social benefits, but few studies have examined their potential effect on the risk of mortality. We therefore undertook a national study in Canada to examine associations between urban greenness and cause-specific mortality.We used data from a large cohort study (the 2001 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort [2001 CanCHEC]), which consisted of approximately 1Â·3 million adult (aged â¥19 years), non-immigrant, urban Canadians in 30 cities who responded to the mandatory 2001 Statistics Canada long-form census. The cohort has been linked by Statistics Canada to the Canadian mortality database and to annual income tax filings through 2011. We measured greenness with images from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer from NASA's Aqua satellite. We assigned estimates of exposure to greenness derived from remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) within both 250 m and 500 m of participants' residences for each year during 11 years of follow-up (between 2001 and 2011). We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations between residential greenness (as a continuous variable) and mortality. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs per IQR (0Â·15) increase in NDVI adjusted for personal (eg, education and income) and contextual covariates, including exposures to fine particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. We also considered effect modification by selected personal covariates (age, sex, household income adequacy quintiles, highest level of education, and marital status).Our cohort consisted of approximately 1 265 000 individuals at baseline who contributed 11 523 770 person-years. We showed significant decreased risks of mortality in the range of 8-12% from all causes of death examined with increased greenness around participants' residence. In the fully adjusted analyses, the risk was significantly decreased for all causes of death (non-accidental HR 0Â·915, 95% CI 0Â·905-0Â·924; cardiovascular plus diabetes 0Â·911, 0Â·895-0Â·928; cardiovascular 0Â·911, 0Â·894-0Â·928; ischaemic heart disease 0Â·904, 0Â·882-0Â·927; cerebrovascular 0Â·942, 0Â·902-0Â·983; and respiratory 0Â·899, 0Â·869-0Â·930). Greenness associations were more protective among men than women (HR 0Â·880, 95% CI 0Â·868-0Â·893 vs 0Â·955, 0Â·941-0Â·969), and among individuals with higher incomes (highest quintile 0Â·812, 0Â·791-0Â·834 vs lowest quintile 0Â·991, 0Â·972-1Â·011) and more education (degree or more 0Â·816, 0Â·791-0Â·842 vs did not complete high school 0Â·964, 0Â·950-0Â·978).Increased amounts of residential greenness were associated with reduced risks of dying from several common causes of death among urban Canadians. We identified evidence of inequalities, both in terms of exposures to greenness and mortality risks, by personal socioeconomic status among individuals living in generally similar environments, and with reasonably similar access to health care and other social services. The findings support the development of policies related to creating greener and healthier cities.None.",

    "ab": "BackgroundChina is experiencing severe ambient air pollution. However, few studies anywhere have examined the health effects of PM1 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <1 Î¼m), which are a major part of PM2Â·5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2Â·5 Î¼m) and even potentially more harmful than PM2Â·5. We aimed to estimate the effects of ambient daily PM1 and PM2Â·5 concentrations on emergency hospital visits in China.MethodsIn this epidemiological study, we collected daily counts of emergency hospital visits from the 28 largest hospitals in 26 Chinese cities from Sept 9, 2013, to Dec 31, 2014. Ground-based monitoring data for PM1 and PM2Â·5 and meteorological data were also collected. Hospital-specific emergency hospital visits associated with PM1 or PM2Â·5 were evaluated with a time-series Poisson regression. The effect estimates were then pooled at the country level using a random-effects meta-analysis.FindingsThe mean daily concentration of PM1 in all cities was 42Â·5 Î¼g/m3 (SD 34Â·6) and of PM2Â·5 was 51Â·9 Î¼g/m3 (41Â·5). The mean daily number of emergency hospital visits in all hospitals was 278 (SD 173). PM1 and PM2Â·5 concentrations were significantly associated with an increased risk of emergency hospital visits at lag 0â2 days (cumulative relative risk [RRs] 1Â·011 [95% CI 1Â·006â1Â·017] for a 10 Î¼g/m3 increase in PM1 and 1Â·010 [1Â·005â1Â·016] for a 10 Î¼g/m3 increase in PM2Â·5). Slightly higher RRs of ambient PM1 and PM2Â·5 pollution were noted among women and children than among men and adults, respectively, but without statistical significance. Given a cause-effect association, 4Â·47% (95% CI 2Â·05â6Â·79) and 5Â·05% (2Â·23â7Â·75) of daily emergency hospital visits in China could be attributed to ambient PM1 and PM2Â·5 pollution, respectively.InterpretationExposure to both ambient PM1 and PM2Â·5 were significantly associated with increased emergency hospital visits. The results suggest that most of the health effects of PM2Â·5 come from PM1.FundingNone.",

    "ab": "Experimental evidence and preliminary clinical evidence suggest that environmental air pollution adversely effects kidney health. Previous work has examined the association between fine particulate matter and risk of kidney disease; however, the association between ambient coarse particulate matter (PM10; â¤10 Î¼m in aerodynamic diameter), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) and risk of incident chronic kidney disease, chronic kidney disease progression, and end-stage renal disease is not clear.We merged multiple large databases, including those of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Veterans Affairs, to build a cohort of US veterans, and used survival models to evaluate the association between PM10, NO2, and CO concentrations and risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min per 1Â·73 m2, incident chronic kidney disease, eGFR decline of 30% or more, and end-stage renal disease. We treated exposure as time-varying when it was updated annually and as cohort participants moved.Between Oct 1, 2003, and Sept 30, 2012, 2 010 398 cohort participants were followed up over a median of 8Â·52 years (IQR 8Â·05-8Â·80). An increased risk of eGFR of less than 60 mL/min per 1Â·73 m2 was associated with an IQR increase in concentrations of PM10 (hazard ratio 1Â·07, 95% CI 1Â·06-1Â·08), NO2 (1Â·09, 1Â·08-1Â·10), and CO (1Â·09, 1Â·08-1Â·10). An increased risk of incident chronic kidney disease was associated with an IQR increase in concentrations of PM10 (1Â·07, 1Â·05-1Â·08), NO2 (1Â·09, 1Â·08-1Â·11), and CO (1Â·10, 1Â·08-1Â·11). An increased risk of an eGFR decline of 30% or more was associated with an IQR increase in concentrations of PM10 (1Â·08, 1Â·07-1Â·09), NO2 (1Â·12, 1Â·10-1Â·13), and CO (1Â·09, 1Â·08-1Â·10). An increased risk of end-stage renal disease was associated with an IQR increase in concentrations of PM10 (1Â·09, 1Â·06-1Â·12), NO2 (1Â·09, 1Â·06-1Â·12), and CO (1Â·05, 1Â·02-1Â·08). Spline analyses suggested a monotonic increasing association between PM10, NO2, and CO concentrations and risk of kidney outcomes.Environmental exposure to higher concentrations of PM10, NO2, and CO is associated with increased risk of incident chronic kidney disease, eGFR decline, and end-stage renal disease.US Department of Veterans Affairs.",

    "ab": "BackgroundBisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS) are increasingly used in consumer products as substitutes for bisphenol A (BPA), a widespread environmental endocrine disruptor and putative obesogen. However, studies on the effects of BPF and BPS on obesity in human beings are scarce. We examined the associations of BPA, BPF, and BPS exposure with obesity in US adults.MethodsWe included participants aged 20 years or older, who had available data on concentrations of BPA, BPF, and BPS (n=1709), from a cross-sectional study, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013â14. Participants who were pregnant or had cancer were excluded from the analysis. Urinary BPA, BPF, and BPS concentrations were measured using on-line solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. We used body-mass index to define general obesity and waist circumference to define abdominal obesity. We used logistic regression with sample weights to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for obesity.Findings1521 participants were included in the analysis. Higher BPA, BPF, and BPS concentrations were observed in adults who were obese than adults who were not obese; median concentration 1Â·5 ng/mL (IQR 0Â·7â2Â·8) versus 1Â·1 ng/mL (0Â·5â2Â·3) for BPA, 0Â·4 ng/mL (0Â·1â1Â·3) versus 0Â·3 ng/mL (0Â·1â0Â·9) for BPF, and 0Â·4 ng/mL (0Â·2â1Â·0) versus 0Â·3 ng/mL (0Â·1â0Â·8) for BPS. After adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors, and urinary creatinine concentrations, BPA, but not BPF or BPS, was significantly associated with obesity. The OR for general obesity was 1Â·78 (95% CI 1Â·10â2Â·89; p=0Â·04 for trend) comparing the highest with lowest quartile of BPA, 1Â·02 (0Â·70â1Â·47; p=0Â·81 for trend) for BPF, and 1Â·22 (0Â·81â1Â·83; p=0Â·30 for trend) for BPS. The corresponding OR for abdominal obesity was 1Â·55 (1Â·04â2Â·32; p=0Â·02 for trend) for BPA, 1Â·05 (0Â·68â1Â·63; p=0Â·99 for trend) for BPF, and 1Â·16 (0Â·72â1Â·88; p=0Â·54 for trend) for BPS.InterpretationWhereas there were significant associations of BPA exposure with general and abdominal obesity, concentrations of BPF or BPS were not significantly associated with obesity in US adults at current exposure levels. Continued biomonitoring of these bisphenols and further investigation into their health effects on human beings are warranted.FundingNational Institutes of Health.",

    "ab": "BackgroundMost prospective studies on the health effects of particulate ambient air pollution exposure have focused on high-income countries, which have much lower pollutant concentrations than low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and different sources of pollution. We aimed to investigate the cardiorespiratory health effects of particulate ambient air pollution exposure in LMICs exclusively.MethodsFor this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, LILACS, Global Health, and Proquest for studies published between database inception and Nov 28, 2016, investigating the cardiorespiratory health effects of particulate ambient air pollution exposure in LMICs. Data were extracted from published studies by one author, and then checked and verified by all authors independently. We pooled estimates by pollutant type (particulate matter with a diameter of <2Â·5 Î¼m [PM2Â·5] or 2Â·5â10 Î¼m [PM10]), lag, and outcome, and presented them as excess relative risk per 10 Î¼g/m3 increase in particulate ambient air pollution. We used a random-effects model to derive overall excess risk. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016051733.FindingsOf 1553 studies identified, 91 met the full eligibility criteria. Only four long-term exposure studies from China were identified and not included in the meta-analysis. A 10 Î¼g/m3 increase in same-day PM2Â·5 was associated with a 0Â·47% (95% CI 0Â·34â0Â·61) increase in cardiovascular mortality and a 0Â·57% (0Â·28â0Â·86) increase in respiratory mortality. A 10 Î¼g/m3 increase in same-day PM10 was associated with a 0Â·27% (0Â·11â0Â·44) increase in cardiovascular mortality and a 0Â·56% (0Â·24â0Â·87) increase in respiratory mortality.InterpretationShort-term exposure to particulate ambient air pollution is associated with increases in cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality in LMIC's, with apparent regional-specific variations.FundingNone.",

    "ab": "<h2>Summary<\/h2><h3>Background<\/h3> The emergence of human malaria due to the monkey parasite <i>Plasmodium knowlesi<\/i> threatens elimination efforts in southeast Asia. Changes in land use are thought to be driving the rise in reported <i>P knowlesi<\/i> cases, but the role of individual-level factors is unclear. To address this knowledge gap we assessed human and environmental factors associated with zoonotic knowlesi malaria risk. <h3>Methods<\/h3> We did this population-based case-control study over a 2 year period in the state of Sabah in Malaysia. We enrolled cases with microscopy-positive, PCR-confirmed malaria who presented to two primary referral hospitals serving the adjacent districts of Kudat and Kota Marudu. We randomly selected three malaria-negative community controls per case, who were matched by village within 2 weeks of case detection. We obtained questionnaire data on demographics, behaviour, and residential malaria risk factors, and we also assessed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity. We used conditional logistic regression models to evaluate exposure risk between <i>P knowlesi<\/i> cases and controls, and between <i>P knowlesi<\/i> and human-only <i>Plasmodium<\/i> spp malaria cases. <h3>Findings<\/h3> From Dec 5, 2012, to Jan 30, 2015, we screened 414 patients and subsequently enrolled 229 cases with <i>P knowlesi<\/i> malaria mono-infection and 91 cases with other <i>Plasmodium<\/i> spp infection. We enrolled 953 matched controls, including 683 matched to <i>P knowlesi<\/i> cases and 270 matched to non-<i>P knowlesi<\/i> cases. Age 15 years or older (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4Â·16, 95% CI 2Â·09â8Â·29, p<0Â·0001), male gender (4Â·20, 2Â·54â6Â·97, p<0Â·0001), plantation work (3Â·50, CI, 1Â·34â9Â·15, p=0Â·011), sleeping outside (3Â·61, 1Â·48â8Â·85, p=0Â·0049), travel (2Â·48, 1Â·45â4Â·23, p=0Â·0010), being aware of the presence of monkeys in the past 4 weeks (3Â·35, 1Â·91â5Â·88, p<0Â·0001), and having open eaves or gaps in walls (2Â·18, 1Â·33â3Â·59, p=0Â·0021) were independently associated with increased risk of symptomatic <i>P knowlesi<\/i> infection. Farming occupation (aOR 1Â·89, 95% CI 1Â·07â3Â·35, p=0Â·028), clearing vegetation (1Â·89, 1Â·11â3Â·22, p=0Â·020), and having long grass around the house (2Â·08, 1Â·25â3Â·46, p=0Â·0048) increased risk for <i>P knowlesi<\/i> infection but not other <i>Plasmodium<\/i> spp infection. G6PD deficiency seemed to be protective against <i>P knowlesi<\/i> (aOR 0Â·20, 95% CI 0Â·04â0Â·96, p=0Â·045), as did residual insecticide spraying of household walls (0Â·52, 0Â·31â0Â·87, p=0Â·014), with the presence of young sparse forest (0Â·35, 0Â·20â0Â·63, p=00040) and rice paddy around the house (0Â·16, 0Â·03â0Â·78, 0Â·023) also associated with decreased risk. <h3>Interpretation<\/h3> Adult men working in agricultural areas were at highest risk of knowlesi malaria, although peri-domestic transmission also occurrs. Human behavioural factors associated with <i>P knowlesi<\/i> transmission could be targeted in future public health interventions. <h3>Funding<\/h3> United Kingdom Medical Research Council, Natural Environment Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, and Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council.",

    "ab": "Extensive flooding occurred during the winter of 2013-14 in England. Previous studies have shown that flooding affects mental health. Using data from the 2013-14 Public Health England National Study of Flooding and Health, we compared the prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder between participants displaced by flooding and those flooded, but not displaced, 1 year after flooding.In this multivariable ordinal regression analysis, we collected data from a cross-sectional survey collected 1 year after the flooding event from flood-affected postcodes in five counties in England. The analysis was restricted to individuals whose homes were flooded (n=622) to analyse displacement due to flooding. The primary outcome measures were depression (measured by the PHQ-2 depression scale) and anxiety (measured by the two-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder [GAD]-2 anxiety scale), and post-traumatic stress disorder (measured by the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist [PCL]-6 scale). We adjusted analyses for recorded potential confounders. We also analysed duration of displacement and amount of warning received.People who were displaced from their homes were significantly more likely to have higher scores on each scale; odds ratio (OR) for depression 1Â·95 (95% CI 1Â·30-2Â·93), for anxiety 1Â·66 (1Â·12-2Â·46), and for post-traumatic stress disorder 1Â·70 (1Â·17-2Â·48) than people who were not displaced. The increased risk of depression was significant even after adjustment for severity of flooding. Scores for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were higher in people who were displaced and reported receiving no warning than those who had received a warning more than 12 h in advance of flooding (p=0Â·04 for depression, p=0Â·01 for post-traumatic stress disorder), although the difference in anxiety scores was not significant.Displacement after flooding was associated with higher reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder 1 year after flooding. The amount of warning received showed evidence of being protective against symptoms of the three mental illnesses studied, and the severity of flooding might be the reason for some, but not all, of the differences between the groups.National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Units (HPRU) in Emergency Preparedness and Response at King's College London, Environmental Change and Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Evaluation of Interventions at the University of Bristol, Public Health England.",

    "ab": "Air particulate matter (PM) is a ubiquitous environmental exposure associated with oxidation, inflammation, and age-related chronic disease. Whether PM is associated with loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and risk of bone fractures is undetermined.We conducted two complementary studies of: (i) long-term PM <2.5 Î¼m (PM2.5) levels and osteoporosis-related fracture hospital admissions among 9.2 million Medicare enrollees of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic United States between 2003-2010; (ii) long-term black carbon [BC] and PM2.5 levels, serum calcium homeostasis biomarkers (parathyroid hormone, calcium, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D), and annualized BMD reduction over a 8-year follow-up of 692 middle-aged (46.7Â±12.3 yrs), low-income BACH/Bone cohort participants.In the Medicare analysis, risk of bone fracture admissions at osteoporosis-related sites was greater in areas with higher PM2.5 levels (Risk ratio [RR] 1.041, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.030, 1.051). This risk was particularly high among low-income communities (RR 1.076; 95% CI, 1.052, 1.100). In the longitudinal BACH/Bone study, baseline BC and PM2.5 levels were associated with lower serum PTH (Estimate for baseline one interquartile increase in 1-year average BC= -1.16, 95% CI -1.93, -0.38; Estimate for baseline one interquartile increase in 1-year average PM2.5= -7.39; 95%CI -14.17, -0.61). BC level was associated with higher BMD loss over time at multiple anatomical sites, including femoral neck (-0.08%/year per one interquartile increase; 95% CI -0.14, -0.02%/year) and ultradistal radius (-0.06%/year per one interquartile increase; 95% CI -0.12, -0.01%/year).Our results suggest that poor air quality is a modifiable risk factor for bone fractures and osteoporosis, especially in low-income communities.",

    "ab": "BackgroundEl NiÃ±o and its effect on local meteorological conditions potentially influences interannual variability in dengue transmission in southern coastal Ecuador. El Oro province is a key dengue surveillance site, due to the high burden of dengue, seasonal transmission, co-circulation of all four dengue serotypes, and the recent introduction of chikungunya and Zika. In this study, we used climate forecasts to predict the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in the city of Machala, following one of the strongest El NiÃ±o events on record.MethodsWe incorporated precipitation, minimum temperature, and NiÃ±o3Â·4 index forecasts in a Bayesian hierarchical mixed model to predict dengue incidence. The model was initiated on Jan 1, 2016, producing monthly dengue forecasts until November, 2016. We accounted for misreporting of dengue due to the introduction of chikungunya in 2015, by using active surveillance data to correct reported dengue case data from passive surveillance records. We then evaluated the forecast retrospectively with available epidemiological information.FindingsThe predictions correctly forecast an early peak in dengue incidence in March, 2016, with a 90% chance of exceeding the mean dengue incidence for the previous 5 years. Accounting for the proportion of chikungunya cases that had been incorrectly recorded as dengue in 2015 improved the prediction of the magnitude of dengue incidence in 2016.InterpretationThis dengue prediction framework, which uses seasonal climate and El NiÃ±o forecasts, allows a prediction to be made at the start of the year for the entire dengue season. Combining active surveillance data with routine dengue reports improved not only model fit and performance, but also the accuracy of benchmark estimates based on historical seasonal averages. This study advances the state-of-the-art of climate services for the health sector, by showing the potential value of incorporating climate information in the public health decision-making process in Ecuador.FundingEuropean Union FP7, Royal Society, and National Science Foundation.",

Following use, anaesthetic gases are expelled into the atmosphere, where they contribute to anthropogenic climate change.1Vollmer M Rhee T Rigby M et al.Modern inhalation anesthetics: potent greenhouse gases in the global atmosphere.Geophys Res Lett. 2015; 42: 1606-1611Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2Campbell M Pierce J Atmospheric science, anaesthesia, and the environment.BJA Education. 2015; 15: 173-179Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Pierce J The environment, the gas bill, and the route to sustainable anaesthesia.RCOA Bull. 2013; 82: 39-41Google Scholar, 4Sherman J Le C Lamers V Eckelman M Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of anesthetic drugs.Anesth Analg. 2012; 114: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 5Ishizawa Y Special article: general anesthetic gases and the global environment.Anesth Analg. 2011; 112: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar Recently, the atmospheric concentrations of anaesthetic gases have been determined, and the most damaging agent, desflurane, is rapidly increasing.1Vollmer M Rhee T Rigby M et al.Modern inhalation anesthetics: potent greenhouse gases in the global atmosphere.Geophys Res Lett. 2015; 42: 1606-1611Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar The Montreal protocol aims to phase out global chlorofluorocarbon use, with hydrofluorocarbons subsequently targeted through the 2016 Kigali amendment;6UN Environment ProgrammeFrequently asked questions relating to the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.http://ozone.unep.org/sites/ozone/files/pdfs/FAQs_Kigali_Amendment_v3.pdfDate: 2016Google Scholar however, anaesthetic gases are often excluded from such discussions because of their medical necessity. The damage caused by the release of anaesthetic gases has been comprehensively described; nevertheless, the barriers to sustainable practice changes in anaesthesia has not, we believe, been sufficiently addressed. Anaesthetic gases represent 5% of the carbon footprint for all acute National Health Service (NHS) organisations, or 50% of gas emissions from the heating of acute NHS buildings and water.7NHS Sustainable Development UnitCarbon Hotspots report.http://www.sdu.nhs.uk/corporate-requirements/measuring-carbon-footprint/nhs-carbon-footprint.aspxDate: 2012Google Scholar Likewise, the use of desflurane or sevoflurane from a modern anaesthetic machine for 1 h is the same as 230 or 30 miles travelled in a modern car, respectively.8Ryan SM Nielsen CJ Global warming potential of inhaled anesthetics: application to clinical use.Anesth Analg. 2010; 111: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar Despite these comparisons, clinicians struggle to visualise this harm in the context of the good that comes from it. In 2014, the release of hydrofluorocarbon and chlorofluorocarbon anaesthetic gases stood at the equivalent of 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, with 80% of emissions from desflurane alone.1Vollmer M Rhee T Rigby M et al.Modern inhalation anesthetics: potent greenhouse gases in the global atmosphere.Geophys Res Lett. 2015; 42: 1606-1611Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar An equivalent of 6% of global carbon dioxide emissions result from nitrous oxide, and 1% of these are medicinal. Therefore, if the land area of the UK represented global carbon dioxide emissions, desflurane would be a town the size of Bedford and nitrous oxide would be the size of the metropolitan area of Bristol. The interpretation of this scale is subjective, and although we would argue for a marginal gains approach, others might see the contribution of anaesthetic gases, overall, as negligible. Along with the personal preferences of individual anaesthetists, the practice of anaesthesia is influenced by patient, surgical, and anaesthetic factors. Despite these varied influences, there is currently no consensus with regards to the balance between beneficence and maleficence for the immediate patient, and populations affected by climate change. There is considerable practice variation on the use of hydrofluorocarbon and chlorofluorocarbon anaesthetics, even in the UK, and efforts to standardise their use are often met by many barriers. Furthermore, the scope of change would have to extend far beyond the UK, since climate change is a global phenomenon, and global practices vary widely between countriesâthis change on the international scale would not be without challenges since practices on anaesthesia use around the world are varied and more difficult to address than at a UK-wide level. Additionally, nitrous oxide continues to be a useful method in the fight against acute pain in some circumstances, for which there is currently no alternative. Therefore, agreeing a standardised approach towards the limitation of harm caused by anaesthetic gases presents obvious problems, since the scope must involve everyone, everywhere. Although most modern systems ventilate used gases to the outside atmosphere to avoid theatre pollution, new scavenging devices allow for the collection, capture, reuse, or destruction of gases. Despite these apparent advantages, their safety, benefit, usability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness are as yet unproven. Similarly, the elemental anaesthetic agent Xenon is too costly, both financially and in terms of its energy intensive distillation from air. Financial costs are therefore a major barrier to sustainable practice changes. One could argue that a narrow focus on anaesthetic gases ignores other areas in which clinicians can contribute towards the same goals. Ten such broad examples are keeping up-to-date with recent developments; prescribing antibiotics according to local guidelines; reducing variation in practice and getting treatments or procedures right the first time; encouraging the consumption of less alcohol, less meat, and promoting increased exercise; working with an organisation's quality improvement team to accelerate the adoption of lean working practices; avoiding the use of intravenous drugs when possible, since the sterilisation of intravenous drugs increases their carbon footprint above oral alternatives; reducing, reusing, recycling, and disposing of waste correctly; collaborating with others towards the common purchasing of bulky or high-volume items to reduce transport emissions; encouraging patients to take responsibility for their own health; and discussing resuscitation decisions with the patient at an early stage, to ensure that resources are not being used to provide treatment that the patient does not want. We therefore argue that sustainable anaesthesia is no different to everyday practice: the balancing of benefit and risk for all patients. These barriers to change might explain the continued global use of anaesthetic gases, despite the overwhelming evidence of its contribution to climate change,1Vollmer M Rhee T Rigby M et al.Modern inhalation anesthetics: potent greenhouse gases in the global atmosphere.Geophys Res Lett. 2015; 42: 1606-1611Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2Campbell M Pierce J Atmospheric science, anaesthesia, and the environment.BJA Education. 2015; 15: 173-179Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Pierce J The environment, the gas bill, and the route to sustainable anaesthesia.RCOA Bull. 2013; 82: 39-41Google Scholar, 4Sherman J Le C Lamers V Eckelman M Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of anesthetic drugs.Anesth Analg. 2012; 114: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 5Ishizawa Y Special article: general anesthetic gases and the global environment.Anesth Analg. 2011; 112: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and the effect this has on human populations.9Springmann M Mason-D'Croz D Robinson S et al.Global and regional health effects of future food production under climate change: a modelling study.Lancet. 2016; 387: 1937-1946Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10Watts N Adger WN Agnolucci P et al.Health and climate change: policy responses to protect public health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1861-1914Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar Rather than further physicochemical studies of anaesthetic gases in the atmosphere, these arguments should be engaged with, and lessons learnt from our past must be translated to health care in the developing world.

    "ab": "Youth depression is a major risk factor for suicide, and a leading cause of disability worldwide,1Murray CJ Lopez AD Evidence-based health policy-lessons from the global burden of disease study.Science. 1996; 274: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 2Thapar A Collishaw S Pine DS Thapar AK Depression in adolescence.Lancet. 2012; 379: 1056-1067Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 3Kessler RC Bromet EJ The epidemiology of depression across cultures.Annu Rev Public Health. 2013; 34: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar hence its impact is both devastating and substantial. Although researchers have suggested several potential causal factors that contribute to the development of youth depression including genetic loading, low socioeconomic status, and adverse life events,2Thapar A Collishaw S Pine DS Thapar AK Depression in adolescence.Lancet. 2012; 379: 1056-1067Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar the impact of climate change remains relatively unexplored. In the past three decades, global annual surface temperatures have increased by approximately 0Â·2Â°C per decade, giving rise to concerns for planetary and environmental human health.4Hansen J Sato M Ruedy R Lo K Lea DW Medina-Elizade M Global temperature change.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2006; 103: 14288-14293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar Furthermore, global scale specific humidity, defined as the ratio of water vapour mass of moist air taken with respect to the total mass of the system, has increased in response to rising temperatures.5Willett KM Gillett NP Jones PD Thorne PW Attribution of observed surface humidity changes to human influence.Nature. 2007; 449: 710-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar These planetary changes are believed to be anthropogenic in origin, and are anticipated to increase in extreme precipitation, tropical cyclones, and heat stress events.5Willett KM Gillett NP Jones PD Thorne PW Attribution of observed surface humidity changes to human influence.Nature. 2007; 449: 710-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar In this Comment, we highlight the potential value of considering climatological variables in the assessment of young people with mental illness. One position advanced in the literature is that climate change causes extreme heat events, intensification of storms, flooding, and coastal erosion, all of which might disrupt the societal and economic structures that underpin mental health.6Berry HL Bowen K Kjellstrom T Climate change and mental health: a causal pathways framework.Int J Public Health. 2010; 55: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar Within this framework, individuals in the developing world would be most vulnerable to these direct environmental effects. For example, climate change might alter the quality of soil, preventing agricultural practices that would otherwise supply populations with food.7McMichael AJ Friel S Nyong A Corvalan C Global environmental change and health: impacts, inequalities, and the health sector.BMJ. 2008; 336: 191-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Ongoing climate change could directly result in the degradation of the physical environment, negatively impact food yields and freshwater supplies, leading to the displacement of populations, and eventual loss of livelihoods.7McMichael AJ Friel S Nyong A Corvalan C Global environmental change and health: impacts, inequalities, and the health sector.BMJ. 2008; 336: 191-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Therefore, climate change, and its ensuing negative impact on the physical environment could exacerbate poverty, malnutrition, and disease. Each of these factors could, in turn, serve as independent risks for the development of youth depression in young people living in developing nations. Young individuals with depression and anxiety might be at a disproportionately increased risk for worsening symptoms in the face of changing climate.8Frumkin H Hess J Luber G Malilay J McGeehin M Climate change: the public health response.Am J Public Health. 2008; 98: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 9Norris FH Friedman MJ Watson PJ et al.60,000 disaster victims speak: Part I. An empirical review of the empirical literature, 1981â2001.Psychiatry. 2002; 65: 207-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar Climate change exposes pre-existing psychological vulnerabilities. Individuals with a pre-existing resilience deficit might fail to prepare adequately for extreme events due to the changing climate.10Morrissey SA Reser JP Natural disasters, climate change and mental health considerations for rural Australia.Aust J Rural Health. 2007; 15: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar By contrast, individuals and communities who are prepared for natural disasters associated with changing climate might experience less collective distress.10Morrissey SA Reser JP Natural disasters, climate change and mental health considerations for rural Australia.Aust J Rural Health. 2007; 15: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar Therefore, young individuals are believed to be at greater vulnerability to the negative effects of climate change by virtue of their developing coping capacity. Although few studies evaluating the impact of climate on mental health exist, some suggest that rising temperature might negatively impact mental health. To date, much of the literature has focused on adult mental health. For example, rising temperature and humidity are associated with increases in emergency department visits for mental health concerns.11Vida S Durocher M Ouarda TB Gosselin P Relationship between ambient temperature and humidity and visits to mental health emergency departments in Quebec.Psych Serv. 2012; 63: 1150-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar One study showed a positive correlation between emergency department visits and mean surface temperatures.11Vida S Durocher M Ouarda TB Gosselin P Relationship between ambient temperature and humidity and visits to mental health emergency departments in Quebec.Psych Serv. 2012; 63: 1150-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar Increased rates of emergency department visits occurred during summer months and the rate of mental health concerns increased between 5â10% at higher temperatures (ie, 25Â°C as opposed to 20Â°C).11Vida S Durocher M Ouarda TB Gosselin P Relationship between ambient temperature and humidity and visits to mental health emergency departments in Quebec.Psych Serv. 2012; 63: 1150-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar Furthermore, researchers have proposed an association between humidity and temperature with mental health outcomes.12Ding N Berry HL Bennett CM The importance of humidity in the relationship between heat and population mental health: Evidence from Australia.PLoS One. 2016; 11: e0164190Google Scholar, 13Hansen AL Bi P Nitschke M Ryan P Pisaniello D Tucker G The effect of heatwaves on mental health in a temperate Australian city.Epidemiology. 2008; 19: 1369-1375Google Scholar Increasing temperature and vapour pressure were associated with a significant increase of high distress.12Ding N Berry HL Bennett CM The importance of humidity in the relationship between heat and population mental health: Evidence from Australia.PLoS One. 2016; 11: e0164190Google Scholar Humidity modulates the effect of temperature on distress.12Ding N Berry HL Bennett CM The importance of humidity in the relationship between heat and population mental health: Evidence from Australia.PLoS One. 2016; 11: e0164190Google Scholar In high temperatures, humidity augmented distress, whereas in low temperatures, humidity mitigated distress.12Ding N Berry HL Bennett CM The importance of humidity in the relationship between heat and population mental health: Evidence from Australia.PLoS One. 2016; 11: e0164190Google Scholar Additionally, only a few studies have endeavoured to evaluate the effects of climate on mental health specifically in youth. For example, a study surveyed Nicaraguan adolescents after Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and its findings revealed severe levels of both post-traumatic stress and depressive reactions.14Goenjian AK Molina L Steinberg AM et al.Posttraumatic stress and depressive reactions among Nicaraguan adolescents after hurricane Mitch.Am J Psychiatry. 2001; 158: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar These results extend the work conducted by Norris and colleagues,9Norris FH Friedman MJ Watson PJ et al.60,000 disaster victims speak: Part I. An empirical review of the empirical literature, 1981â2001.Psychiatry. 2002; 65: 207-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar who showed that, by contrast with adults, young individuals were both more susceptible to environmental-related trauma and more likely to become depressed if their family members were injured. Taken together, these studies highlight the unique vulnerabilities and comorbidities of adolescents who have faced environmental disasters associated with climate change. Collectively, these findings indicate a significant and nuanced impact of climate on youth mental health across the world. In countries with large land masses, climate measures vary greatly across provinces and regions. Consequently, researchers aiming to characterise the link between climate change and youth depression should account for regional differences in surface temperatures and humidity. Moreover, delineation of possible mediators of climate-induced depression (ie, sex, prior traumatic exposure, and parental injury) could enhance disaster preparedness and lead to strategic deployment of therapeutic interventions. Youth depression is a burgeoning illness that may be uniquely sensitive to changes in global climate. Young people might be particularly vulnerable to climate-induced depression when faced with parental injury. Although the literature is still developing, several studies now suggest that fluctuations in climate affect both the onset and severity of depression at a population level. We believe that researchers and clinicians treating young people with mental illness should familiarise themselves with the potential ways in which climate change has already impacted mental health outcomes. Finally, researchers should identify ways to fortify the societal structures necessary for mental health that climate change threatens to erode. We declare no competing interests.",

    "ab": "The Paris Agreement was a major political step towards reducing the risks of climate change; however, even if the agreed reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are fully implemented, the global average temperature will still have increased by about 3Â°C above preindustrial levels by the end of the century.1UNEPThe emissions gap report 2016. United Nations Environment Programme, Nairobi2016Google Scholar Deeper cuts are needed for the achievement of the long-term goal of keeping the increase to well below 2Â°C. An obvious rationale for action is the imperative to reduce the risks to health from climate change, but in an era when powerful interests seek to cast doubt on climate change science,2Oreskes N Conway E The merchants of doubt. Bloomsbury Press, USA2010Google Scholar major ancillary near-term benefits (co-benefits) of climate action provide added justification for policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Health co-benefits can arise through several pathways, including through reduced air pollution, increased physical activity, and dietary change.3Haines A McMichael AJ Smith KR et al.Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: overview and implications for policy makers.Lancet. 2009; 374: 2104-2114Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar The International Energy Agency suggested that a 7% increase in investment to achieve a âClean Air Scenarioâ could result in saving 3 million premature deaths worldwide in 2040, provide energy access for all, and lead to a peak in carbon dioxide emissions in 2020.4International Energy AgencyWorld energy outlook special report. International Energy Agency, Paris, France2016Google Scholar The figure shows the sources of major primary air pollutants. In China, under the same scenario, mean life expectancy is increased by 15 months in 2040, relative to today. Although the benefits are larger in more highly polluted countries, they can be substantial even in developed nations. For example, in the USA, clean energy policies consistent with warming of 2Â°C could prevent 175 000 premature deaths by 2030, and subsequently 22 000 (95% CI 11 000â96 000) annually after 2030, with clean transportation contributing additional benefits.5Shindell D Lee Y Faluvegi G Climate and health impacts of US emissions reductions consistent with 2Â°C.Nat Clim Chang. 2016; 6: 503-507Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar Global average marginal co-benefits of avoided mortality have been valued between US$50â380 per tonne of carbon dioxide, which exceed marginal abatement costs in 2030 and 2050.6West JJ Smith SJ Silva RA et al.Co-benefits of mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions for future air quality and human health.Nat Clim Chang. 2013; 3: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar Global fossil fuel subsidies are estimated to total around $5Â·3 trillion annually, largely as a result of a failure to account for the costs of air pollution and climate change.7IMF Working paper. How large are global energy subsidies? International Monetary Fund, Washington, DC2015http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2015/NEW070215A.htmGoogle Scholar Removing these subsidies and implementing carbon taxes could, if properly designed, improve health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, redistribute wealth, and stimulate employment. Policies to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, particularly black carbon, a component of fine particulate air pollution arising from incomplete combustion, could result in 0Â·7â4Â·7 million avoided premature deaths annually from reduced ambient air pollution alone.8Shindell D Kuylenstierna JCI Vignati E et al.Simultaneously mitigating near term climate change and improving human health and food security.Science. 2012; 335: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar Reductions in methane, another short-lived climate pollutant and a precursor of tropospheric ozone, which damages crop growth, could increase annual crop yields by 30â135 million tonnes due to ozone reductions in 2030 and beyond.8Shindell D Kuylenstierna JCI Vignati E et al.Simultaneously mitigating near term climate change and improving human health and food security.Science. 2012; 335: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar A 2016 systematic review9Aleksandrowicz L Green R Joy EJM Smith P Haines A The impacts of dietary change on greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, and health: a systematic review.PLoS One. 2016; 11: e0165797Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar has shown the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, together with land and water use, by shifting present dietary intakes to environmentally more sustainable healthy diets, suggesting that median reductions of 20â30% across these indicators are possible in high-income settings, with modest reductions in all-cause mortality risk. Reductions in environmental footprints were generally proportional to the magnitude of animal-based food restriction. The greatest per-calorie environmental impacts were for ruminant meat, followed by other animal products, and lowest for many plant-based foods. Additional evidence from low-income settings is needed. Studies of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve health in urban environments have shown the potential to achieve both environmental and health improvements. For example, modelled effects of low emission vehicles and increased walking and cycling in London and Delhi showed major benefits to health outweighing the increased risk of exposure to road injuries. In the case of London, the main benefits were projected from increased active travel, which reduced the risk of diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and other health outcomes related to sedentary lifestyle.10Woodcock J Edwards P Tonne C et al.Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: urban land transport.Lancet. 2009; 374: 1930-1943Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar In cities with high air pollution levels such as Delhi, a substantial proportion of the health benefits are likely to be due to air pollution reduction. If urban populations in England and Wales had similar patterns of walking and cycling to those achieved in Copenhagen, about Â£17 billion of costs could be averted from the National Health Service over 20 years, increasing further beyond that period.11Jarrett J Woodcock J Griffiths UK et al.Effect of increasing active travel in urban England and Wales on National Health Service costs.Lancet. 2012; 379: 2198-2205Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar Assessments of policies to mitigate environmental change should specifically consider the potential unintended adverse consequences (co-harms). Some types of biofuels, such as corn alcohol, compete directly with important food crops. Diesel engines were promoted in some countries because of their reduced greenhouse gas emissions but have higher emissions of fine particulates and nitrogen oxides. Increasing the energy efficiency of houses by use of improved insulation and draught proofing might increase exposure to household air pollution unless accompanied by improved ventilation to prevent the build-up of harmful pollutants.3Haines A McMichael AJ Smith KR et al.Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: overview and implications for policy makers.Lancet. 2009; 374: 2104-2114Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar Future studies of health co-benefits need more consistent methods, counterfactual scenarios, and timescales to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of different strategies.12Remais J Hess J Ebi K et al.Estimating the health effects of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies: addressing parametric, model and valuation challenges.Environ Health Perspect. 2014; 122: 447-455PubMed Google Scholar The concept can be extended to policies to reduce other types of environmental change and future research also needs to consider how improved understanding of co-benefits can most effectively help catalyse action by policy makers to support planetary health.

    "ab": "We examined prospectively whether social capital mitigates the adverse effects of natural disaster on cognitive decline.The baseline for our study was established seven months before the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in a survey of older community-dwelling adults who lived 80 kilometers west of the epicenter (59.0% response rate). Approximately two and a half years after the disaster, the follow-up survey gathered information about personal experiences of disaster as well as incidence of cognitive disability (82.1% follow-up rate). Our primary outcome was cognitive disability (measured on an 8-level scale) assessed by in-home assessment.The experience of housing damage was associated with risk of cognitive impairment (coefficient = 0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.02 to 0.06). Factor analysis of our analytic sample (n = 3,566) established two sub-scales of social capital: a cognitive dimension (perceptions of community social cohesion) and a structural dimension (informal socializing and social participation). Fixed effects regression showed that informal socializing and social participation buffered the risk of cognitive decline resulting from housing damage.Informal socializing and social participation may prevent cognitive impairment following natural disaster.National Institutes of Health (R01AG042463-04), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.",

    "ab": "BackgroundUnprecedented levels of habitat transformation and rapid urbanisation are changing the way individuals interrelate with the natural environment in developing countries with high economic disparities. Although the potential benefit of green environments for mental health has been recognised, population-level evidence to this effect is scarce. We investigated the effect of green living environment in potentially countering incident depression in a nationally representative survey in South Africa.MethodsWe used panel data from the South African National Income Dynamics Study (SA-NIDS). Our study used SA-NIDS data from three waves: wave 1 (2008), wave 2 (2010), and wave 3 (2012). Households were sampled on the basis of a stratified two-stage cluster design. In the first stage, 400 primary sampling units were selected for inclusion. In the second stage, two clusters of 12 dwelling units each were drawn from within each primary sampling unit (or 24 dwelling units per unit). Household and individual adult questionnaires were administered to participants. The main outcome, incident depression (ie, incident cohort of 11 156 study participants without significant depression symptoms at their first entry into SA-NIDS), was assessed in the adult survey via a ten item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; a total score of ten or higher was used as a cutoff to indicate significant depressive symptoms. Each participant was assigned a value for green living space via a satellite-derived normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the GPS coordinates of their household location.FindingsOverall, we found uneven benefit of NDVI on incident depression among our study participants. Although the green living environment showed limited benefit across the study population as a whole, our final analysis based on logistic regression models showed that higher NDVI was a predictor of lower incident depression among middle-income compared with low-income participants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0Â·98, 0Â·97â0Â·99, p<0Â·0001), although when this analysis was broken down by race, its positive effect was particularly evident amongst African individuals. Living in rural areas was linked to lower odds of incident depression (aOR 0Â·71, 0Â·55â0Â·92, p=0Â·011) compared with study participants residing in urban informal areas that often lack formal planning.InterpretationOur results imply the importance of green environments for mental wellbeing in sub-Saharan African settings experiencing rapid urbanisation, economic and epidemiological transition, reaffirming the need to incorporate environmental services and benefits for sustainable socioeconomic development.FundingSouth African Medical Research Council, National Institutes of Health, and Academy of Finland.",

    "ab": "Occurrence, severity and geographic extent of droughts are anticipated to increase under climate change, but the health consequences of drought conditions are unknown. We estimate risks of cardiovascular and respiratory-related hospitalization and mortality associated with drought conditions for the western U.S. elderly population.For counties in the western U.S. (N=618) and for the period 2000 to 2013, we use data from the U.S. Drought Monitor to identify: 1) full drought periods; 2) non-drought periods; and 3) worsening drought periods stratified by low- and high-severity. We use Medicare claims to calculate daily rates of cardiovascular admissions, respiratory admissions, and deaths among adults 65 years or older. Using a two-stage hierarchical model, we estimated the percentage change in health risks when comparing drought to non-drought period days controlling for daily weather and seasonal trends.On average there were 2Â·1 million days and 0Â·6 million days classified as non-drought periods and drought periods, respectively. Compared to non-drought periods, respiratory admissions significantly decreased by -1Â·99% (95% posterior interval (PI): -3Â·56, -0Â·38) during the full drought period, but not during worsening drought conditions. Mortality risk significantly increased by 1Â·55% (95% PI: 0Â·17, 2Â·95) during the high-severity worsening drought period, but not the full drought period. Cardiovascular admissions did not differ significantly during either drought or worsening drought periods. In counties where drought occurred less frequently, we found risks for cardiovascular disease and mortality to increase during worsening drought conditions.Drought conditions increased risk of mortality during high-severity worsening drought, but decreased the risk of respiratory admissions during full drought periods among older adults. Counties that experience fewer drought events show larger risk for mortality and cardiovascular disease. This research describes an understudied environmental association with global health significance.",

We aimed to assess the association of prenatal exposure to vanadium with the risk of adverse birth outcomes in babies born to women in China.MethodsFor this population-based cohort study, the Healthy Baby Cohort, women were recruited from three cities in Hubei Province, China. Women included in this analysis were recruited from Wuhan Women and Children Medical Care Center, Wuhan. We measured urinary concentrations of vanadium and other metals simultaneously using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We used multivariable logistic regressions, with adjustment for potential confounders, to estimate the associations of natural logarithm transformed creatinine-corrected urinary vanadium (Ln-vanadium) concentrations as continuous variables and categorised into quartiles (Q; Q1: â¤0Â·84 Î¼g/g creatinine, Q2: 0Â·84â1Â·40 Î¼g/g creatinine, Q3: 1Â·40â2Â·96 Î¼g/g creatinine, Q4: >2Â·96 Î¼g/g creatinine, with the lowest quartile set as reference) with preterm delivery, early-term delivery, low birthweight, and being small for gestational age. We applied restricted cubic spline models to evaluate the dose-response relationships.FindingsData from 7297 women recruited between Sept 22, 2012, and Oct 22, 2014, were included in this study. Urinary Ln-vanadium concentrations showed non-linear dose-response relationships with risk of preterm delivery (S-shaped, p<0Â·0001) and low birthweight (J-shaped, p=0Â·0001); the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for increasing quartiles of urinary vanadium were 1Â·76 (95% CI 1Â·05â2Â·95) for Q2, 3Â·17 (1Â·96â5Â·14) for Q3, and 8Â·86 (5Â·66â13Â·86) for Q4 for preterm delivery, and 2Â·29 (95% CI 1Â·08â4Â·84) for Q2, 3Â·22 (1Â·58â6Â·58) for Q3, and 3Â·56 (1Â·79â7Â·10) for Q4 for low birthweight. Ln-vanadium concentrations were linearly associated with the risk of early-term delivery (linear, p<0Â·0001) and being small for gestational age (linear, p=0Â·0027), with adjusted ORs of 1Â·15 (95% CI 1Â·10â1Â·21) for early-term delivery and 1Â·12 (1Â·04â1Â·21) for being small for gestational age per unit increase in Ln-vanadium concentrations.InterpretationOur findings reveal a relationship between prenatal exposure to higher levels of vanadium and increased risk of adverse birth outcomes, suggesting that vanadium might be a potential toxic metal for human beings. Further studies are needed to replicate the observed associations and investigate the interaction effects of prenatal exposure to different metals on adverse birth outcomes.FundingNational Key R&D Plan of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Key Laboratory of Environment and Health.",

    "ab": "BackgroundObesity is a major health issue and an important public health target for urban design. However, the evidence for identifying the optimum residential density in relation to obesity has been far from compelling. We examined the association of obesity with residential density in a large and diverse population sample drawn from the UK Biobank to identify healthy-weight-sustaining density environments.MethodsFor this full-data, cross-sectional analysis, we used UK Biobank data for adult men and women aged 37â73 years from 22 cities across the UK. Baseline examinations were done between 2006 and 2010. Residential unit density was objectively assessed within a 1 km street catchment of a participant's residence. Other activity-influencing built environment factors were measured in terms of density of retail, public transport, and street-level movement density, which were modelled from network analyses of through movement of street links within the defined catchment. We regressed adiposity indicators of body-mass index (BMI; kg/m2), waist circumference (cm), whole body fat (kg), and obesity (WHO criteria of BMI â¥30 kg/m2) on residential density (units per km2), adjusting for activity-influencing built environment factors and individual covariates. We also investigated effect modification by age, sex, employment status, and physical activity. We used a series of linear continuous and logistic regression models and non-linear restricted cubic spline models as appropriate.FindingsOf 502 649 adults in the prospective cohort, 419 562 (83Â·5%) participants across 22 UK Biobank assessment centres met baseline data requirements and were included in the analytic sample. The fitted restricted cubic spline adiposity-residential density doseâresponse curve identified a turning point at a residential density of 1800 residential units per km2. Below a residential density of 1800 units per km2, an increment of 1000 units per km2 was positively related with adiposity, being associated with higher BMI (Î² 0Â·19 kg/m2, 95% CI 0Â·14 to 0Â·24), waist circumference (Î² 0Â·41 cm, 0Â·28 to 0Â·54), and whole body fat (Î² 0Â·40 kg, 0Â·30 to 0Â·50), and with increased odds of obesity (odds ratio [OR] 1Â·10, 1Â·07 to 1Â·14). Beyond 1800 units per km2, residential density had a protective effect on adiposity and was associated with lower BMI (Î² â0Â·22 kg/m2, â0Â·25 to â0Â·20), waist circumference (Î² â0Â·54 cm, â0Â·61 to â0Â·48), and whole body fat (Î² â0Â·38 kg, â0Â·43 to â0Â·33), and with decreased odds of obesity (OR 0Â·91, 0Â·90 to 0Â·93). Subgroup analyses identified more pronounced protective effects of residential density among individuals who were younger, female, in employment, and accumulating higher levels of physical activity, except in the case of whole body fat, for which the protective effects were stronger in men.InterpretationHousing-level policy related to the optimisation of healthy density in cities might be a potential upstream-level public health intervention towards the minimisation and offsetting of obesity; however, further research based on accumulated prospective data is necessary for evidencing specific pathways. The findings might mean that governments, such as the UK Government, who are attempting to prevent suburban densification by, for example, prohibiting the subdivision of single lot housing and the conversion of domestic gardens to housing lots, will potentially have the effect of inhibiting the conversion of suburbs into more healthy places to live.FundingUniversity of Hong Kong, UK Biobank, and UK Economic & Social Research Council.",

    "ab": "BackgroundThe population of sub-Saharan Africa is currently estimated to be 1245 million and is expected to quadruple by the end of the century, necessitating the building of millions of homes. Malaria remains a substantial problem in this region and efforts to minimise transmission should be considered in future house planning. We studied how building elements, which have been successfully employed in southeast Asia to prevent mosquitos from entering and cooling the house, could be integrated in a more sustainable house design in rural northeastern Tanzania, Africa, to decrease mosquito density and regulate indoor climate.MethodsIn this field study, six prototype houses of southeast Asian design were built in in the village of Magoda in Muheza District, Tanga Region, Tanzania, and compared with modified and unmodified, traditional, sub-Saharan African houses. Prototype houses were built with walls made of lightweight permeable materials (bamboo, shade net, or timber) with bedrooms elevated from the ground and with screened windows. Modified and unmodified traditional African houses, wattle-daub or mud-block constructions, built on the ground with poor ventilation served as controls. In the modified houses, major structural problems such as leaking roofs were repaired, windows screened, open eaves blocked with bricks and mortar, cement floors repaired or constructed, and rain gutters and a tank for water storage added. Prototype houses were randomly allocated to village households through a free, fair, and transparent lottery. The lottery tickets were deposited in a bucket made of transparent plastic. Each participant could draw one ticket. Hourly measurements of indoor temperature and humidity were recorded in all study houses with data loggers and mosquitoes were collected indoors and outdoors using Furvela tent traps and were identified with standard taxonomic keys. Mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex were identified to species using PCR. Attitudes towards the new house design were assessed 6â9 months after the residents moved into their new or modified homes through 15 in-depth interviews with household heads of the new houses and five focus group discussions including neighbours of each group of prototype housing.FindingsBetween July, 2014, and July, 2015, six prototype houses were constructed; one single and one double storey building with each of the following claddings: bamboo, shade net, and timber. The overall reduction of all mosquitoes caught was highest in the double-storey buildings (96%; 95% CI 92â98) followed closely by the reduction found in single-storey buildings (77%; 72â82) and lowest in the modified reference houses (43%; 36â50) and unmodified reference houses (23%; 18â29). The indoor temperature in the new design houses was 2Â·3Â°C (95% CI 2Â·2â2Â·4) cooler than in the reference houses. While both single and two-storey buildings provided a cooler indoor climate than did traditional housing, two-story buildings provided the biggest reduction in mosquito densities (96%, 95% CI 89â100). Seven people who moved into the prototype houses and seven of their neighbours (three of whom had their houses modified) participated in in-depth interviews. After living in their new prototype houses for 6â9 months, residents expressed satisfaction with the new design, especially the second-storey sleeping area because of the privacy and security of upstairs bedrooms.InterpretationThe new design houses had fewer mosquitoes and were cooler than modified and unmodified traditional homes. New house designs are an underused intervention and hold promise to reduce malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa and keep areas malaria-free after elimination.FundingRuth W Jensens Foundation, Copenhagen and Hanako Foundation, Singapore.",

    "ab": "BackgroundIndoor air pollution (IAP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are associated with lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) or wheezing in children. However, the effect of the timing of these exposures, specifically antenatal versus postnatal, and of alternate fuel sources such as the increasingly used volatile organic compounds have not been well studied. We longitudinally investigated the effect of antenatal or postnatal IAP and ETS on LRTI or wheezing prevalence and severity in African infants.MethodsMother and infant pairs enrolled over a 3-year period in a birth cohort study in two centres in Paarl, South Africa, were followed for the first year of life for LRTI or wheezing illness. We measured exposure to IAP (particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds benzene and toluene) using devices placed in homes, antenatally and postnatally. We measured ETS longitudinally by maternal self-report and by urine cotinine measures. Study staff trained in recognition of LRTI or wheeze documented all episodes, which were categorised according to WHO case definition criteria. We used multivariate logistic and Poisson regressions to explore associations.FindingsBetween March 1, 2012, and March 31, 2015, we enrolled 1137 mothers with 1143 livebirths. Of 1065 infants who attended at least one study visit, 524 episodes of LRTI occurred after discharge with a wheezing prevalence of 0Â·23 (95% CI 0Â·21â0Â·26) episodes per child year. Exposures associated with LRTI were antenatal maternal smoking (incidence rate ratio 1Â·62, 95% CI 1Â·14â2Â·30; p=0Â·004) or particulate matter (1Â·43, 1Â·06â1Â·95; p=0Â·008). Subanalyses of LRTI requiring hospitalisation (n=137) and supplemental oxygen (n=69) found antenatal toluene significantly increased the risk of LRTI-associated hospitalisation (odds ratio 5Â·13, 95% CI 1Â·43â18Â·36; p=0Â·012) and need for supplemental oxygen (13Â·21, 1Â·96â89Â·16; p=0Â·008). Wheezing illness was associated with both antenatal (incidence rate ratio 2Â·09, 95% CI 1Â·54â2Â·84; p<0Â·0001) and postnatal (1Â·27, 95% CI 1Â·03â1Â·56; p=0Â·024) maternal smoking. Antenatally, wheezing was associated with maternal passive smoke exposure (1Â·70, 1Â·25â2Â·31; p=0Â·001) and, postnatally, with any household member smoking (1Â·55, 1Â·17 â2Â·06; p=0Â·002).InterpretationAntenatal exposures were the predominant risk factors associated with LRTI or wheezing illness. Toluene was a novel exposure associated with severe LRTI. Urgent and effective interventions focusing on antenatal environmental factors are required, including smoking cessation programmes targeting women of childbearing age pre-conception and pregnant women.FundingBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Discovery Foundation, South African Thoracic Society AstraZeneca Respiratory Fellowship, Medical Research Council South Africa, National Research Foundation South Africa, and CIDRI Clinical Fellowship.",

    "ab": "Planetary health was launched to better understand and address the ways in which human impacts to natural systems are adversely affecting human health. Planetary health provides the opportunity to adopt new ways to: produce a useful evidence base characterising complex, global environmental change and human health linkages; do transdisciplinary systems-based research involving end users; and thereby co-create solutions for transformative change. A systems approach for planetary health involves understanding that human health outcomes emerge from complex interactions between natural and social systems and that stakeholder engagement is necessary in the coproduction of this knowledge. The Rockefeller FoundationâLancet Commission introduced a new field: planetary health that is defined as \"the health of human civilisation and the state of the natural systems on which it depends\".1Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.2015. Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller FoundationâLancet Commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar Planetary health presents the opportunity to take a transdisciplinary approach to develop strategies to reduce and prevent risks to human health and natural systems. The opportunity to improve and sustain human health through the enhancement of stewardship of natural systems and the reduction of exploitative use of resources linked to unsustainable consumption and production patterns is a new concept in global health and medical practice. The report advocated for a closed-loop, systems approach to improve understanding of the complex inter-relationship between human health and wellbeing and natural systems.1Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.2015.

Systems-based methods for integration and analyses of data across disciplines are being increasingly recognised for facilitating the transdisciplinary collaboration required to advance the understanding of planetary health. Identification of practical opportunities for prevention and mitigation of the impacts on human health caused by human-driven environmental changes requires a systems-based understanding of the interconnections and feedbacks to strategically address upstream drivers rather than the consequences (direct and indirect) to human health alone. The study of planetary health at a given spatial scale of interest (ie, city, subnational, national, and regional) requires an understanding of how human-driven stressors, singly or in combination, lead to global and local environmental change and how this change affects human health. The relationship between human-driven environmental change and human health can be non-linear, affected by delays, and dominated by feedback loops across social, economic, and environmental dimensions. These complex, dynamic interactionsâincluding interactions between globally and locally driven changesâand feedbacks can lead to immediate or delayed emergence of positive or adverse health outcomes. Examples include the potential for either poorly designed biofuel policies to adversely affect poverty, nutrition, and health, or the promotion of diesel engine vehicles for climate change mitigation to cause negative health effects.3Wilkinson P Haines A Diesel in the dock.BMJ. 2015; (published online Oct 12.)DOI:10.1136/bmj.h5415Google Scholar Systems approaches have been used by intergovernmental organisations and national government agencies. UN Environment's Green Economy Initiative has adopted systems approaches to support national assessments of the associations between economic development, natural resources, and societal interests of concern.4Probst G Bassi AM Tackling complexity, a systemic approach for decision makers. Greenleaf Publishing, Sheffield2014Google Scholar The United States Environmental Protection Agency has embraced systems thinking and applied collaborative systems-based approaches, such as participatory system dynamics simulation modelling, as useful tools to address challenges such as land use, coastal pollution, and social wellbeing at the watershed scale. Future Earth and the Urban Health and Wellbeing programmes of the International Council for Science have also worked based on systems approaches.5Bai X Surveyer A Elmqvist T et al.Defining and advancing a systems approach for sustainable cities.Curr Opin Environ Sustain. 2016; 23: 69-78Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar These systems approaches are defined by: scientific methods that aim to understand human health as an emergent property of socioecological complexity; and the role that human beings have in defining, framing, and engaging in the processes of knowledge generation and action. A systems approach also considers values. People perceive and attach value to qualities of their environment and the ways in which they interact with it. Value is created as an emergent property of complex rule-based interactions between people and their environment. A systems approach to planetary health considers and readdresses the ways in which people have previously interacted with and used the planet's resources and asks whether those interactions remain healthy for society and the human population. For these reasons, a systems-based understanding of the context-specific challenge of planetary health is necessary to anticipate potential side-effects, unintended consequences, trade-offs, and synergies, and effectively inform policy and planning to identify, prepare for, monitor, and mitigate policy outcomes towards achievement of long-term sustainability. Application of a systems approach to planetary health has several benefits. One benefit of systems thinking is the identification of potential non-linear changes and interactions between multiple environmental stressors that might have greater impact than does the sum of their parts. These effects are important because they might result in a sudden change in natural systems prejudicial to human health. An analysis of abrupt shifts occurring in marine ecosystems showed that they were due to a combination of factors such as nutrient inputs, fishing, climate change, urbanisation, and sewage acting at different scales.6Rocha J Yletyinen J Biggs R Blenckner T Peterson G Marine regime shifts: drivers and impacts on ecosystems services.Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2015; (published online Nov 24.)DOI:10.1098/rstb.2013.0273Google Scholar Early identification and evidence-based action can help to avoid irreversible damage to natural systems and human health. The systems approach grounds planetary health in a specific decision context, at the spatial scale, and with the data available to characterise it. This approach can provide a framework to understand key dynamic interactions, feedbacks, and unintended consequences across sectors. This understanding can help to identify the probable socioeconomic consequences of conservation, health, and development policies under consideration. For example, protection of peatlands from land clearance by fire might not only protect the public from hazardous exposures to fine particulate matter in fire emissions but also strengthen mitigation efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.7Koplitz S Mickley L Marlier M et al.Public health impacts of the severe haze in Equatorial Asia in SeptemberâOctober 2015: demonstration of a new framework for informing fire management strategies to reduce downwind smoke exposure.Environ Res Lett. 2016; (published online Sept 19.)DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/094023PubMed Google Scholar Systems-based analyses can help to reveal and quantify the health benefits of climate change mitigation strategies as a result of reduced air pollution,8Thompson TM Rausch S Saari RK Selin NE A systems approach to evaluating the air quality co-benefits of US carbon policies.Nat Clim Chang. 2014; 4: 917-923Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar increased physical activity, or healthy diets.9Haines A McMichael AJ Smith KR et al.Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: overview and implications for policy makers.Lancet. 2009; 374: 2104-2114Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar Identification of such wins-wins of policy strategy can support efforts towards policy coherence for sustainable development10The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and DevelopmentPolicy coherence for sustainable development 2017: eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity. OECD Publishing, Paris2017Google Scholar and make trade-offs explicit. Another benefit of the adoption of systems approaches lies in the inclusive, multi-stakeholder process involved in its implementation. Stakeholders can include researchers, policymakers, and civil society representatives. This type of process makes clear at the outset that a systems approach is a collaborative cross-sectoral undertaking designed to produce a shared understanding of the system of inter-relationships, feedbacks, and trade-offs that can support decision making and governance processes.11Innes JE Booher DE Planning with complexity: an introduction to collaborative rationality for public decision-making. Routledge, New York2010Google Scholar Inclusive stakeholder participation, if done well, can result in systems-based understanding upon which to plan for sustainable, healthy futures that people want. Despite the inherent and irreducible uncertainty associated with the understanding of complex systems,1Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.2015. Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller FoundationâLancet Commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar stakeholders need to be part of and own the decisions that should be made while an inclusive participatory process builds social capital in science and society, which in itself can be of value. The systems approach we have described is a transdisciplinary approach by which planetary health science can be bridged to policy to drive change.12Mercure J-F Pollitt H Bassi AM ViÃ±uales JE Edwards NR Modelling complex systems of heterogeneous agents to better design sustainability transitions policy.Glob Environ Change. 2016; 37: 102-115Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar Systems approaches should be complementary to other tools or strategies already in use for sustainability planning. For example, to address planetary health challenges such as climate related health impacts in urban settings, development of a shared systems-based understanding could be the first step to inform the scale of green infrastructure strategies to reduce water runoff and flood risks, and thus avoid unintended consequences such as increased mosquito populations.13Medlock JM Vaux AGC Colonization of a newly constructed urban wetland by mosquitoes in England: implications for nuisance and vector species.J Vector Ecol. 2014; 39: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar The design of green infrastructure strategies could be enhanced by the use of health impact assessments to identify and maximise health benefits such as walkability, public safety, and reduced urban heat island effect.14United States Environmental Protection AgencyProctor Creek's Boone Boulevard Green Street Project Health Impact Assessment (HIA). United States Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC2014Google Scholar Other examples include work of the World Wildlife Fund and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity initiative by UN Environment in various landscapes, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, and Tanzania. In these case studies, various modelling approaches were integrated in a single framework of analysis to identify possible side-effects and synergies emerging from policy implementation.15Bassi AM Gallagher LA Helsingen H Green economy modeling of ecosystem services along the road to Dawei.Environments. 2016; 3: 19Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar Methods and tools included systems thinking, system dynamics, spatially explicit land-use models, and ecosystem services models. These methods and tools were harmonised and linked together through the support of a diverse group of researchers, and under the leadership of a variety of local stakeholders representing various Ministries and interest groups. Such complementary, integrated systems-based approaches can support more efficient planning and implementation processes and help to optimise policy interventions by identifying win-win strategies across societal, environmental, and economic concerns. Health risks could be greatly reduced and the benefits of sustainable development policies could be exploited if the drivers and consequences of global and local environmental changes are understood and responded to in policy and planning; however, new approaches are needed for this to happen. A transdisciplinary systems approach to planetary health elucidates interactions and feedback relationships in complex natural and social systems as important drivers of human health and wellbeing. This approach also reflects values based on people's interactions with and use of natural systems. The main benefits of a systems approach are the potential to identify non-linear and irreversible changes in natural systems with serious implications for health, to develop a shared understanding of planetary health challenges in a relevant decision-making context, and the engagement with stakeholders to apply this cross-sectoral understanding to bridge science, policy, and action.

    "ab": "When many of us contemplate the role of agriculture in feeding 7Â·2 billion people, we picture large-scale, industrialised, and efficient systems that produce lots of food that is shipped around the world. Although those systems are relevant, they are only one dimension of what agriculture consists of, who feeds us, and where those farmers reside. Of the 570 million farms worldwide, 83% of which are in sub-Saharan Africa (9%) and Asia (74%), 475 million are smallholder farms (<2 hectares).1Lowder SK Skoet J Raney T The number, size, and distribution of farms, smallholder farms, and family farms worldwide.World Dev. 2016; 87: 16-29Crossref Scopus (739) Google Scholar These smallholder farms operate about 12% of the world's agricultural land.1Lowder SK Skoet J Raney T The number, size, and distribution of farms, smallholder farms, and family farms worldwide.World Dev. 2016; 87: 16-29Crossref Scopus (739) Google Scholar They produce some of the major commodities consumed in the world and provide more than 70% of the food calories to people living in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa;2Samberg LH Gerber JS Ramankutty N Herrero M West PC Subnational distribution of average farm size and smallholder contributions to global food production.Environ Res Lett. 2016; 11: 124010Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar yet many of these farmers are poor and somewhat neglected. These farmers lack the necessary capital for rural development and transformation, including natural, built, human, social, political, and financial capital.3IFADRural development report: fostering inclusive rural transformation. International Fund for Agricultural Development, Rome2016Google Scholar A requisite exists to support all sizes of farms to ensure that a consistent, sustainable supply of diverse, nutritious, and safe foods are available and accessible to all through their food systems and environments. However, many question whether food systemsâconsisting of many actors in the agricultural food chainâare fulfiling human health and nutrition requirements.4Garnett T Plating up solutions.Science. 2016; 353: 1202-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar Looking at statistics, the state of the world's food systems is bleak: roughly 793 million go to bed hungry, 125 million children under the age of five years are stunted, 2Â·1 billion adults are overweight and obese, and many are deficient in key micronutrients, particularly iron, zinc, and vitamin A.5IFPRIGlobal nutrition report. International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington, DC2016Google Scholar Poor diets play into these multiple burdens of malnutrition and are now considered the leading risk of the global burden of disease.6Forouzanfar MH Afshin A Alexander LT et al.GBD 2015 Risk Factors CollaboratorsGlobal, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990â2015.Lancet. 2016; 388: 1659-1724Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar In this inaugural issue of Lancet Planetary Health, Mario Herrero and colleagues7Herrero M Thornton PK Power B et al.Farming and the geography of nutrient production for human use: a transdisciplinary analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e33-e42Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar shed light on how smallholder farmers contribute to the quantity and quality of our global food supply. In their Article, they seek to better estimate where these farms are located, what agricultural commodities (plants, livestock, and fish) are produced from farms of different sizes, how diverse these commodities are, and what their relevance to nutrient production is. First, they found that most large farms (>50 ha) are found in North America and South America, Australia, and New Zealand, and produce 75â100% of all cereal, livestock, and fruit in these regions, whereas small farms (<20 ha) found in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, southeast Asia, and China produce 75% of food commodities globally, and 50â65% of the production volume of major food groups. Very small farms (<2 ha) in the same region produce approximately 30% of most food commodities. Second, most of the commodities produced on small farms come from diverse landscapes, producing a variety of horticulture, roots, tubers, fish, and livestock, whereas most of the plantation-based crops, such as sugar and oil, are produced from less diverse landscapes, mainly large-scale farms. Finally, mixed production systems generate more diversity of key nutrients (zinc, iron, vitamins A and B12, and folate) essential for human health. Most global micronutrients (53â81%) and protein (57%) are produced on more diverse agricultural landscapes (H-index>1Â·5). One thing to note is that in farm landscapes with higher agricultural diversity and more nutrients generated from that diversity, farm size does not matter. Herrero and colleagues' findings show that the one-size-fits-all approach does not work for global food production. Both small and large farms play important roles in ensuring we have enough food that is diverse and nutrient-rich. While industrialised agriculture suggests domination of food systems, smallholder farms play a substantial role in maintaining the genetic diversity of our food supply, which results in both benefits and risk reductions against nutritional deficiencies, ecosystem degradation, and climate change. Herrero and colleagues argue that if we want to ensure that the global food supply remains diverse and generates a rich array of nutrients for human health, farm landscapes must also be diverse and serve multiple purposes. However, the world is moving in the wrong direction. National food supplies have become more homogenous in the number of crops cultivated, which results in an interdependency among countries in accessing a diversity of foods and nutrients to meet human needs.8Khoury CK Bjorkman AD Dempewolf H et al.Increasing homogeneity in global food supplies and the implications for food security.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2014; 111: 4001-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar Farm sizes are decreasing in Africa and Asia, and will continue to do so.9Masters WA Djurfeldt AA De Haan C et al.Urbanization and farm size in Asia and Africa: implications for food security and agricultural research.Glob Food Sec. 2013; 2: 156-165Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar As diminishing of genetic diversity across farms and decreasing land size is compounded by absolute poverty in rural places, will farmers abandon these small, yet diverse landscapes for off-farm opportunities or better livelihood strategies in urban centers? Farmers grapple with many challenges: climate change, demographic shifts, migration, and food policy decisions, such as subsidies and trade, which affect decisions. Many smallholder farmers struggle to make ends meet, and historically, we have witnessed an urban bias and disinvestment in rural areas.10Heady D Bezemer D Agriculture, development and urban bias.World Dev. 2008; 36: 1342-1364Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar It is crucial that we invest in smallholder farmers and their own rural transformation and human capital: we need to better connect rural farmers to markets, empower and engage women farmers, and jumpstart entrepreneurship among smallholder farmers. Food security and nutrition strategies are needed to ensure that farming families are healthy and capable of continuing to make important contributions to the overall dietary diversity of the world's population.

Farming and the geography of nutrient production for human use: a transdisciplinary analysisOur results show that farm size and diversity of agricultural production vary substantially across regions and are key structural determinants of food and nutrient production that need to be considered in plans to meet social, economic, and environmental targets. At the global level, both small and large farms have key roles in food and nutrition security. Efforts to maintain production diversity as farm sizes increase seem to be necessary to maintain the production of diverse nutrients and viable, multifunctional, sustainable landscapes.

    "ab": "Air pollution increases intestinal permeability, alters the gut microbiome, and promotes inflammation, which might contribute towards gastrointestinal bleeding. In the present study, we aim to examine whether short-term elevations in air pollution are associated with increased numbers of emergency hospital admissions for peptic ulcer bleeding in Hong Kong.Daily air pollution (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2Â·5 Î¼m [PM2Â·5], nitric oxide [NO2], sulpher dioxide [SO2], and ozone [O3]) data during 2005-10 were collected from the Environmental Protection Department and emergency admission data for peptic ulcer bleeding in elderly people (aged 65 years or older) from the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong. A time stratified case-crossover analysis with conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the excess risk of peptic ulcer bleeding associated with each air pollutant, in single-pollutant and multi-pollutant models. Cardiorespiratory diseases were used as positive controls.8566 emergency admissions for peptic ulcer bleeding were recorded among Hong Kong's elderly population during 2005-10; the daily number of admissions ranged from 0 to 13. An IQR increment of 5-day moving average (lag04) of NO2 concentration (25Â·8 Î¼g/m3) was associated with a 7Â·6% (95% CI 2Â·2-13Â·2) increase in emergency admissions for peptic ulcer bleeding. Multi-pollutant models confirmed the robustness of the risk estimates for NO2. Other pollutants (PM2Â·5, SO2, and O3) were not associated with peptic ulcer bleeding admissions.Short-term elevation in ambient NO2 might trigger peptic ulcer bleeding events and increase the risk of emergency admissions for peptic ulcer bleeding in Hong Kong's elderly population. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that air pollution affects not just cardiopulmonary diseases, but also certain diseases of the digestive system.None.",

    "ab": "BackgroundAlthough the effects of air pollution on mortality have been clearly shown in many epidemiological and observational studies, the pro-arrhythmic effects remain unknown. We aimed to assess the short-term effects of air pollution on ventricular arrhythmias in a population of high-risk patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) or cardiac resynchronisation therapy defibrillators (ICD-CRT).MethodsIn this prospective multicentre study, we assessed 281 patients (median age 71 years) across nine centres in the Veneto region of Italy. Episodes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation that were recorded by the diagnostic device were considered in this analysis. Concentrations of particulate matter of less than 10 Î¼m (PM10) and less than 2Â·5 Î¼m (PM2Â·5) in aerodynamic diameter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone were obtained daily from monitoring stations, and the 24 h median value was considered. Each patient was associated with exposure data from the monitoring station that was closest to their residence. Patients were followed up for 1 year and then scheduled to have a closing visit, within 1 more year. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01723761.FindingsParticipants were enrolled from April 1, 2011, to Sept 30, 2012, and follow-ups (completed on April 5, 2014) ranged from 637 to 1177 days (median 652 days). The incidence of episodes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation correlated significantly with PM2Â·5 (p<0Â·0001) but not PM10. An analysis of ventricular fibrillation episodes alone showed a significant increase in risk of higher PM2Â·5 (p=0Â·002) and PM10 values (p=0Â·0057). None of the gaseous pollutants were significantly linked to the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. In a subgroup analysis of patients with or without a previous myocardial infarction, only the first showed a significant association between particulate matter and episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.InterpretationParticulate matter has acute pro-arrhythmic effects in a population of high-risk patients, which increase on exposure to fine particles and in patients who have experienced a previous myocardial infarction. The time sequence of the arrhythmic events suggests there is an underlying neurally mediated mechanism. From a clinical point of view, the results of our study should encourage physicians to also consider environmental risk when addressing the prevention of arrhythmic events, particularly in patients with coronary heart disease, advising them to avoid exposure to high levels of fine particulate matter.FundingThere was no funding source for this study.",

    "ab": "Bisphenols are used in the polymerisation of polycarbonate plastics and production of epoxy resins. Bisphenol A (BPA) was first synthesised by Alexander Dianin in 1891, and was considered for use as a pharmaceutical oestrogen for pregnant women, but was not sufficiently potent, and eventually diethylstilbestrol was used instead.1Vandenberg LN Maffini MV Sonnenschein C Rubin BS Soto AM Bisphenol-A and the great divide: a review of controversies in the field of endocrine disruption.Endocr Rev. 2009; 30: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar Increasing evidence from the past two decades suggest that synthetic chemicals represent an underrecognised third key factor in the obesity epidemic worldwide, alongside diet and physical activity.2Lind L Lind PM Lejonklou MH et al.Uppsala Consensus Statement on environmental contaminants and the global obesity epidemic.Environ Health Perspect. 2016; 124: A81-A83Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar Bisphenols are one major category of chemicals now recognised as obesogens. Laboratory studies have documented that BPA makes fat cells bigger and inhibits function of adiponectin.3Trasande L Attina TM Blustein J Association between urinary bisphenol A concentration and obesity prevalence in children and adolescents.JAMA. 2012; 308: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar Cross-sectional and longitudinal human studies3Trasande L Attina TM Blustein J Association between urinary bisphenol A concentration and obesity prevalence in children and adolescents.JAMA. 2012; 308: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 4Philips EM Jaddoe VW Trasande L Effects of early exposure to phthalates and bisphenols on cardiometabolic outcomes in pregnancy and childhood.Reprod Toxicol. 2017; 68: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Song Y Hauser R Hu FB Franke AA Liu S Sun Q Urinary concentrations of bisphenol A and phthalate metabolites and weight change: a prospective investigation in US women.Int J Obes. 2014; 38: 1532-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar have also associated BPA exposure with obesity in children and adults. Notably, human studies have not consistently identified the key periods of susceptibility. Differences in results between studies might be the result of leveraging a limited number of spot urine samples in pregnancy as a proxy of exposure. Given that the half-life of BPA is generally 24â48 h, use of a modest number of spot samples introduces exposure imprecision that can influence statistical results. Obesity is not the only concern documented for BPA. Epidemiological studies have identified neurocognitive effects of BPA6Braun JM Kalkbrenner AE Calafat AM et al.Impact of early-life bisphenol A exposure on behavior and executive function in children.Pediatrics. 2011; 128: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar and newly incident coronary artery disease,7Melzer D Osborne NJ Henley WE et al.Urinary bisphenol a concentration and risk of future coronary artery disease in apparently healthy men and women.Circulation. 2012; 125: 1482-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar and laboratory studies strongly suggest BPA is an ovarian toxicant.8Peretz J Vrooman L Ricke WA et al.Bisphenol A and reproductive health: update of experimental and human evidence, 2007â2013.Environ Health Perspect. 2014; 122: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar The rapidly rising evidence of adverse effects has prompted manufacturers to substitute BPA with various bisphenols (BPS, BPP, BPZ, and BPF, to name a few). These chemicals were not required to be proven as safer alternatives because of the Toxic Substances Control Act, which, until June, 2016, when President Obama signed legislation updating the law, presumed chemicals to be innocent until proven guilty in terms of toxicity in the USA, requiring little toxicity testing data before approval for widespread use by the Environmental Protection Agency.9Trasande L Updating the toxic substances control act to protect human health.JAMA. 2016; 315: 1565-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar What little we know about one BPA replacement, BPS, suggests serious concerns.

In The Lancet Planetary Health, Buyun Liu and colleagues12Liu B Lehmler H-J Sun Y et al.Bisphenol A substitutes and obesity in US adults: analysis of a population-based, cross-sectional study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e114-e122Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar examine data from the 2013â14 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to study cross-sectional associations of urinary concentrations of BPA, BPF, and BPS with obesity in adults. Their analysis confirms persistent associations of BPA with obesity, despite lower exposures than previously studied. Although associations of urinary BPF or BPS with body-mass index or obesity were not significant, Liu and colleagues' analyses raise more questions than answers about whether non-A bisphenols are obesogenic. The authors used statistical models to examine effects of each bisphenol independent of the other; however, no potency data are available to aggregate effects of model relationships in aggregate across the bisphenols, and examination of interactions to evaluate synergy or antagonism were not done. Exposures to BPF and BPS were much lower and less prevalent than BPA and the cross-sectional evaluation of adult obesity is an important limitation of the study design given the known life-course origins, especially early life exposures that can have a big impact on adult obesity.4Philips EM Jaddoe VW Trasande L Effects of early exposure to phthalates and bisphenols on cardiometabolic outcomes in pregnancy and childhood.Reprod Toxicol. 2017; 68: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar Longitudinal studies are needed, especially to examine pregnancy and early childhood exposures, as are studies that assess the period after the introduction of BPA. Most longitudinal cohort studies of BPA exposure are limited by missing measurements of non-A bisphenols and missing associations could be caused by imprecision in the measurement of bisphenol exposure. Although these issues complicate interpretation of human studies, they exemplify the problem of so-called regrettable substitution. The economic benefits of substituting BPA in the linings of aluminium cans with an alternative free of health effects (US$1Â·74 billion per year) were found to nearly outweigh the costs of a natural alternative oleoresin ($2Â·2 billion per year), and this analysis was limited to benefits associated with reductions in BPA-attributable childhood obesity and coronary artery disease.10Trasande L Further limiting bisphenol a in food uses could provide health and economic benefits.Health Aff. 2014; 33: 316-323Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar Oleoresin is not necessarily a feasible alternative for all canned foods, but substitution of BPA with BPF, BPS, or another bisphenol might result in the same associations with adverse health outcomes as BPA, after years of studies in the laboratory and human beings. The European Commission has the opportunity to set the platform for a stronger regulatory framework for bisphenols and other endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that necessitate the use of safer alternatives when laboratory and other studies suggest that they cause adverse effects. The stakes are high; EDC-associated diseases and disabilities extend well beyond bisphenols to a broader array of synthetic chemicals, with effects including adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and male and female reproductive disorders. The costs of EDC exposures are estimated to be â¬163 billion in the European Union and $340 billion in the USA.13Attina TM Hauser R Sathyanarayana S et al.Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the USA: a population-based disease burden and cost analysis.Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 2016; 4: 996-1003Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar Although these estimates are based on known exposures, they suggest the large, potential societal benefits of proactive and thorough screening of new chemicals before they can be introduced into the market, and reconsidering the use of non-A bisphenols and other potentially regrettable substitutes.

Bisphenol A substitutes and obesity in US adults: analysis of a population-based, cross-sectional studyWhereas there were significant associations of BPA exposure with general and abdominal obesity, concentrations of BPF or BPS were not significantly associated with obesity in US adults at current exposure levels. Continued biomonitoring of these bisphenols and further investigation into their health effects on human beings are warranted. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "Potential synergies between public health and environmental protection that offer new opportunities for achieving health and sustainable development targets have been postulated. However, empirical evidence of the effect of ecosystem degradation and protection on public health outcomes is scarce, which restricts policy makers' ability to assess the net health effects of land-use change.We used generalised linear mixed-effects models to analyse data for 35 547 households in 1766 communities from the Cambodian Demographic Health Surveys to investigate the relation between health and protected areas across deforestation gradients in Cambodia between Feb 1, 2005, and April 30, 2014. Diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection, and fever in children younger than 5 years were used as population health indicators. Dense and mixed forest coverage were derived from Open Development Cambodia, and forest loss was calculated from 2000 to 2004, 2004 to 2009, and 2009 to 2014. The incidence of non-specific illness and injury in people older than 15 years was used as a negative control. Our analyses included rich pseudo-panel data (combining cross-sectional datasets from 2005, 2010, and 2014) that accounted for socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioural characteristics, and had a negative control, approximating a quasi-experimental study design.Deforestation of dense forest was associated with an increased incidence of diarrhoea (p=0Â·007), fever (p=0Â·0495), and acute respiratory infection in children (p=0Â·003). For example, a 10 percentage point increase in loss of dense forest was estimated to be associated with an increase of 14Â·1% (95% CI 2Â·6-35Â·8) in the incidence of diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years per household in the 2 weeks before the Cambodian Demographic Health Surveys. Protected area coverage, but not type, was associated with decreased incidences of diarrhoea (p=0Â·028) and acute respiratory infection (p=0Â·030). Apart from an association between mixed forest coverage and increased incidence of diarrhoea, forest coverage was not associated with any health outcomes.Deforestation is associated with increased risk of several major sources of global childhood morbidity and mortality. Although causal mechanisms are unclear, our findings suggest that protected areas could help to alleviate the global health burden, presenting new possibilities for simultaneous achievement of public health and conservation goals.Ministry of Education of Singapore.",

Orb Media's recent investigation has brought the issue of microplastics in the environment into sharp focus. The analysis of tap water samples from around the world found that a high proportion of drinking water is contaminated with microscopic fragments of plastic (83% of samples collected worldwide, but up to 94% in the USA). Microplastic contamination seems more widespread than we perhaps knew, and they are regularly being ingested by people worldwide.",

    "ab": "BackgroundThe availability of freshwater for irrigation in the Indian agricultural sector is expected to decline over the coming decades. This might have implications for food production in India, with subsequent effects on diets and health. We identify realistic and healthy dietary changes that could enhance the resilience of the Indian food system to future decreases in water availability.MethodsIn this modelling study, we optimised typical dietary patterns in an Indian population sample to meet projected decreases in the availability of water per person for irrigation (blue water footprint) due to population growth (to 2025 and 2050). The optimised diets met nutritional guidelines and minimised deviation from existing patterns. Resulting changes in life-years lost due to coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancers were modelled using life tables, and changes in greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of diets were estimated. The primary outcomes of the model were changes in life-years per 100 000 total population over 40 years (to 2050).FindingsThe optimised diets had up to 30% lower blue water footprints and generally contained lower amounts of wheat, dairy, and poultry, and increased amounts of legumes. In the 2050 scenario, adoption of these diets would on average result in 6800 life-years gained per 100 000 total population (95% CI 1600â13 100) over 40 years. The dietary changes were accompanied by reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The magnitude of the health and environmental effects varied between dietary patterns.InterpretationModest changes in diets could help to address projected reductions in the availability of freshwater for irrigation in India. These dietary changes could also simultaneously reduce diet-related greenhouse gas emissions and improve diet-related health outcomes.FundingWellcome Trust.",

    "ab": "The medical relevance of environmental topics can be blurred by politicised debates and the global scale of the environmental impact of human life. However, a seemingly remote serious health threat is currently floating in our oceans and needs to trigger the attention of the medical community, as its clinical manifestation is only a matter of time. Plastics are one of the most important materials in industrialised countries. Despite huge annual inputs of plastic litter into the oceans (4Â·8â12Â·7 million metric tons), the hazards to both the environment and human health are widely neglected.1Jambeck JR Geyer R Wilcox C et al.Marine pollution. Plastic waste inputs from land into the ocean.Science. 2015; 347: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (5535) Google Scholar Marine plastic contamination has spread across the globe. Several garbage patches have formed in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.2Rochman CM Cook AM Koelmans AA Plastic debris and policy: using current scientific understanding to invoke positive change.Environ Toxicol Chem. 2016; 35: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar Clockwise ocean currents lead to the retention and convergence of plastic debris. These subtropical gyres prevent plastic debris from moving towards mainland coasts. Plastic pollution substantially threatens marine life.3Mansui J Molcard A OurmiÃ¨res Y Modelling the transport and accumulation of floating marine debris in the Mediterranean basin.Mar Pollut Bull. 2015; 91: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar Numerous chemical monomers are used to produce plastic polymers, which are characterised by high longevity. Partial degradation in seawater leads to generation of macro-waste and micro-waste, which causes physical and biological hazards to marine organisms. Release of ecotoxic chemicals from plastic particles provokes chemical and toxicological threats (figure). Furthermore, plastic litter is frequently mistaken for food by marine life, leading to health complications and death. Plastic ingestion has been observed in numerous animals. Plastic parts were found in the stomachs of turtles, and seabirds die from obstruction of their respiratory or digestive tracts by bottle caps.4Derraik JG The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: a review.Mar Pollut Bull. 2002; 44: 842-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (2343) Google Scholar Turtles and seals are trapped by abandoned fishing netsâso-called ghost nets. However, the long persistence of plastic debris is also problematic for other reasons. Combinations of weathering by ultraviolet light, seawater, and mechanical action partly degrade and fragment larger pieces of plastic down to microplastics (<0Â·5 mm). When they sink, small plastic pieces and microplastics are colonised by certain marine organisms, which affects submarine organisms and entire ecosystems, including non-human and human food chains. Via the intake of microplastics or their chemical compounds, which are set free in various decomposition processes, ocean garbage has become a latent threat to the health of future generations, and already affects human health on a global scale. Human biomonitoring shows that compounds used for plastic production are already ubiquitous in human blood and cells.5Koch HM Calafat AM Human body burdens of chemicals used in plastic manufacture.Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2009; 364: 2063-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar Major sources of chemical pollutants are polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, perfluorinated carboxylic acids, and perfluoroalkyl acids,6Engler RE The complex interaction between marine debris and toxic chemicals in the ocean.Environ Sci Technol. 2012; 46: 12302-12315Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar which cause hepatotoxicity. Xenobiotic compounds are metabolised in the liver by the phase 1â3 detoxification system. Phase 1 consists of oxidation reactions to increase hydrophilicity of xenobiotics and facilitating extrusion. In phase 2, xenobiotics are coupled to transfer carrier molecules and in phase 3, xenobiotic compounds are transported out of liver cells for excretion out of the organism. Plastic debris-related pollutants induce cytochrome P450 monooxygenase isoenzyme 1A (CYP1A) phase 1 enzyme activity.7Tian S Pan L Zhang H Identification of a CYP3A-like gene and CYPs mRNA expression modulation following exposure to benzo(a)pyrene in the bivalve mollusk Chlamys farreri.Mar Environ Res. 2014; 94: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar Polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons upregulate CYP1A activity in marine organisms. CYP1A is involved in chemical carcinogenesis, and these compounds form DNA adducts as the first step of tumour development.8Michel C Vincent-Hubert F DNA oxidation and DNA repair in gills of zebra mussels exposed to cadmium and benzo(a)pyrene.Ecotoxicology. 2015; 24: 2009-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar An important phase 3 protein is the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter P-glycoprotein, which is involved in hepatic excretion. P-glycoprotein acts as an ATP-consuming efflux transporter that extrudes a large array of diverse chemicals out of cells.9Efferth T The human ATP-binding cassette transporter genes: from the bench to the bedside.Curr Mol Med. 2001; 1: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar P-glycoproteins are present in mammals (eg, human beings, pigs, and cattle), other vertebrates (eg, fish and reptiles), and invertebrates (eg, worms, molluscs, and insects).10Efferth T Volm M Multiple resistance to carcinogens and xenobiotics: P-glycoproteins as universal detoxifiers.Arch Toxicol. 2017; 91: 2515-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar Many aquatic organisms live in water that is highly polluted with anthropogenic or natural toxins. ABC-transporters enable many aquatic organisms to tolerate toxins and survive even in highly polluted water. This phenomenon is termed multi-xenobiotic resistance. Inhibition of multi-xenobiotic resistance has important implications for environmental risk assessment.

Until now, marine plastic pollution has been considered a remote environmental problem. However, a latent threat to marine life has become an acute threat to human health. Biochemical pathways of degraded and decomposed materials and xenobiotics released by great ocean garbage patches are clear enough to alert us and stimulate us to work on prevention of an otherwise immense health problem.

    "ab": "As a new discipline, the field of planetary health could follow one of two obvious pathways. In the first, practitioners of planetary health would develop a catalogue of the myriad ways in which human health is affected by anthropogenic changes to the environment. Although such an exercise might be valuable, it would not be novel, and the information by itself might not lead to solutions to the critical problems being documented. In the second pathway, planetary health practitioners would use the many adverse health consequences of anthropogenic environmental change as grounds to advocate for better environmental protections. Although there is no doubt that advocacy is necessary to prevent ever more rapid degradation of environmental health, this pathway would de-emphasise the scientific mission of planetary health and emphasise the political one. I argue that there is a third path. Planetary health could document the many cases in which human health and environmental health are simultaneously improved by the same policy or management actions. A thorough exploration of these winâwin situations, with careful analysis of the mechanisms that underlie co-benefits to environmental and human health, could uncover key principles and inform new applications, while providing concrete options for policy and management. Environmental health and human health are both multidimensional concepts. Identification of principles underlying winâwin situations requires identification of specific, measurable components of both environmental and human health. In the example that follows, I specify species diversity (a key component of biodiversity) as a focal metric of environmental health and risk of exposure to zoonotic diseases as a focal metric of human health. Burgeoning research has shown that high biodiversity frequently reduces rates of pathogen transmission and lowers disease risk for human beings, wildlife, livestock, and plants.1Keesing F Belden LK Daszak P et al.Impacts of biodiversity on the emergence and transmission of infectious diseases.Nature. 2010; 468: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 2Ostfeld RS Keesing F Effects of host diversity on infectious disease.Annu Rev Ecol Evol Syst. 2012; 43: 157-182Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Ostfeld RS, Keesing F.

First, most pathogens seem to be host generalists, in the sense that they encounter and potentially infect more than one species of host. Second, these host species differ substantially in their invasibility, susceptibility to infection, and potential to transmit infection to other hosts. Third, in many cases, the hosts most likely to acquire and transmit infection (the so-called reservoir hosts) are species that are abundant, widespread, and resilient to anthropogenic perturbations. Consequently, these reservoir species tend to persist when diversity is reduced, increasing in abundance relative to species more sensitive to disturbance. Consequently, species living in ecological communities with high diversity tend to dilute the effect of the reservoir species and reduce disease risk.6Keesing F Holt RD Ostfeld RS Effects of species diversity on disease risk.Ecology Letters. 2006; 9: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar This \"dilution effect\"6Keesing F Holt RD Ostfeld RS Effects of species diversity on disease risk.Ecology Letters. 2006; 9: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 7Ostfeld RS Keesing F The function of biodiversity in the ecology of vector-borne zoonotic diseases.Can J Zool. 2000; 78: 2061-2078Crossref Google Scholar of high diversity has been best studied in plant and wildlife diseases but is also known to be widespread in human pathogens.2Ostfeld RS Keesing F Effects of host diversity on infectious disease.Annu Rev Ecol Evol Syst. 2012; 43: 157-182Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Civitello DJ Cohen J Fatima H et al.Reply to Salkeld et al.: diversity-disease patterns are robust to study design, selection criteria, and publication bias.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2015; 112: E6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar Its operation can be understood from the following observations. First, most human infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin.9Woolhouse MEJ Gowtage-Sequeria S Host range and emerging and reemerging pathogens.Emerg Infect Dis. 2005; 11: 1842-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar These zoonotic pathogens are capable of infecting multiple species of host. Second, although zoonotic pathogens can originate in many different species of vertebrates, certain mammalian orders are over-represented as pathogen sources. Rodents, in particular, carry more zoonotic pathogens than do any other mammalian order, and far more rodent species host zoonotic pathogens than do other orders.10Han BA Kramer AM Drake JM Global patterns of zoonotic disease in mammals.Trends Parasitol. 2016; 32: 565-577Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar Even within the rodents, the species with fast life history traits (early maturity, large litters, and short longevity) are more likely than species with slower life histories to be reservoirs for zoonotic pathogens.11Han BA Schmidt JP Bowden SE Drake JM Rodent reservoirs of future zoonotic diseases.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2015; 112: 7039-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar Third, fast life histories are typically associated with commonness and resilience to disturbance,12Stearns SC The evolution of life histories. Oxford University Press, London1992Google Scholar suggesting that competent reservoir species will often predominate in low-diversity communities. The propensity for species of plants and animals with fast life history traits to be among the best reservoirs for multi-host pathogens is under active investigation. One possible underlying mechanism could be a tendency for species with fast life histories to have lower resistance or higher tolerance to infection, resulting from trade-offs between reproduction and self-defence.13Ostfeld RS Levi T Jolles AE Martin LB Hosseini PR Keesing F Life history and demographic drivers of reservoir competence for three tick-borne zoonotic pathogens.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e107387Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar Another possible mechanism could be a tendency for multi-host pathogens to specialise on host species that they encounter most frequently, which might be hosts with high average population density.7Ostfeld RS Keesing F The function of biodiversity in the ecology of vector-borne zoonotic diseases.Can J Zool. 2000; 78: 2061-2078Crossref Google Scholar Irrespective of the mechanisms, whenever pathogen transmission or disease risk is lower in high-diversity communities, policies that prevent the loss of biodiversity will simultaneously promote environmental protection and health protection. How common are winâwin situations like this, in which a single policy or management option might improve both environmental protection and human health? Are there specific features shared in common by these situations? When trade-offs between environmental and human health prevail, can policy be adjusted to reduce the costs to the environment or to people? To what degree does the characterisation of a policy as winâwin versus trade-off depend on the specific environmental health or human health outcome being considered? How frequently is the identification of winâwin situations limited by data, and how can data limitations be breached? Planetary health is uniquely poised to address these and related questions, the answers to which will undoubtedly improve both science and health. The urgency of this enterprise grows as assaults on the environment accelerate. I declare no competing interests. I acknowledge helpful input from Felicia Keesing.",

    "ab": "Nutritionists are classically concerned with the associations between nutrients and diets and nutrition and health outcomes. Understanding these associations is important. Insufficient and poor quality food, especially during pregnancy and in early childhood is a major contributor to the high burden of undernutrition: globally, 159 million children younger than 5 years are stunted (too short for their age), 50 million children globally are wasted (dangerously thin), and more than 3 million children die every year from causes associated with undernutrition.1International Food Policy Research InstituteGlobal Nutrition Report 2016: From Promise to Impact: Ending Malnutrition by 2030.http://www.ifpri.org/publication/global-nutrition-report-2016-promise-impact-ending-malnutrition-2030Date: 2016Google Scholar, 2Black RE Victora CG Walker SP et al.Maternal and child undernutrition and overweight in low-income and middle-income countries.Lancet. 2013; 382: 427-451Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4259) Google Scholar Simultaneously, nutrition-related chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some forms of cancer are major contributors to the global burden of disease.3Forouzanfar MH Alexander L Anderson HR et al.Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks in 188 countries, 1990â2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.Lancet. 2015; 386: 2287-2323Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar Ambitious goals have been set by the international community to eliminate malnutrition in all its forms, and 2016 saw the start of a UN Decade of Action on Nutrition designed to reinvigorate national and international efforts for nutrition.4United NationsZero hunger: why it matters?

And the world is changing: the global population is increasing, migration to cities is accelerating, and transitions in dietary habits towards more processed and animal-source based foods are becoming commonplace, putting the food system under ever-increasing pressure. Worryingly, the situation seems likely to deteriorate further, largely as a result of increasing pressures on land-use and environmental change. For example, global and national modelling studies suggest that yields of major cereals will decline under scenarios of increased temperature, especially in tropical countries.6Challinor AJ Watson J Lobell D Howden S Smith D Chhetri N A meta-analysis of crop yield under climate change and adaptation.Nat Clim Chan. 2014; 4: 287-291Crossref Scopus (1111) Google Scholar Water scarcity threatens the ability of large parts of the world to continue its present agricultural growth,7UN Food and Agriculture OrganisationThe state of the world's land and water resources for food and agricultureâmanaging systems at risk.http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/i1688e/i1688e.pdfDate: 2011Google Scholar and agricultural land is increasingly in conflict with infrastructure development and with protected areas. Biodiversity loss, including of critical crop pollinators, and loss of soil quality will both have substantial impacts on global fruit and vegetable supply and thereby on population health.8Smith MR Singh GM Mozaffarian D Myers SS Effects of decreases of animal pollinators on human nutrition and global health: a modelling analysis.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1964-1972Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar The costs for people and governments are also becoming clearer: recent spikes in the price of food, resulting from poor harvests and speculation on world cereal markets led to major riots in more than 20 countries.9Lagi M Bertrand KZ Bar-Yam Y The food crises and political instability in North Africa and the Middle East.http://necsi.edu/research/social/food_crises.pdfDate: 2011Google Scholar Although agriculture is a major contributor to environmental impacts (food production generates up to 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and accounts for substantial proportions of land-use change and global water consumption), there are many opportunities to mitigate or reduce these impacts that will become increasingly important as the demand for food continues to rise. Historically, studies by nutritionists and others working in public health have not been designed to address these new problems that span environmental change, food system activities, and health outcomes within specific socioeconomic, societal, and political contexts (figure). In this new, more complex arena, traditional research and policy that engages across narrowly aligned sectors is limited and typically fails to take on board potentially key underlying changes in the broader food system. The distinct literatures and research communities that have evolved around the food system and health and food system and environment agendas over the past decades now need to converge and coalesce, clarifying trade-offs, and seeking co-benefits and synergistic solutions. In this context, it is not clear whether the results of traditional research, while important for many of the major issues of today, will provide solutions that are fit for the future. Agricultural and food technology research efforts are essential to identify ways to reduce the environmental impacts of the production, processing and distribution of foods, and to enhance the ability of the food system to deliver healthy and nutritious diets to all in a rapidly changing environment. But engagement with people on planetary health, and designing mechanisms to encourage consideration of the public good aspects of food in addition to its private benefits is also critical for a sustained and collective impact. A recent online survey of more than 2000 British adults identified a relatively good public knowledge of climate change and the impact of the food system on the environment.10Global Food SecurityPublic Attitudes to Climatic Shocks and their interaction with the Food System.http://www.foodsecurity.ac.uk/assets/pdfs/public-attitudes-climatic-shocks-interaction-food-system.pdfDate: 2017Google Scholar However, although four in five of those asked stated that they would change their diets to improve their health, only a little more than half said that they would do so to reduce their impact on the environment. Our ability to plan sustainable, equitable, and healthy food systems for the future requires integration of methods from distinct disciplines, innovation in analytical approaches and intersectoral policy analysis and engagement. The Rockefeller FoundationâLancet Commission on Planetary Health11Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller FoundationâLancet commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar identified three first-order challenges to secure human health in the future: challenges of imagination, research, and governance. The complexities of this new planetary health research agenda and the enormous political and governance obstacles to transformational change may slow our collective progress. But let us not allow a lack of empathy and imagination thwart our ambition to deliver environmentally sustainable and healthy diets for all. We declare no competing interests.",

    "ab": "Environmental pollution is a global problem and the subject of increasing worldwide public health concern.1WHOWHO global urban ambient air pollution database (update 2016). 2016http://www.who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/cities/en/Google Scholar In particular, air pollution is regarded as the largest single environmental risk to health. More than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed the WHO limits, and all regions of the world are affected. Declines in urban air quality increase the risk of cerebrovascular accidents, coronary artery disease, lung carcinoma, and chronic and acute respiratory diseases (eg, asthma, obstructive lung disease, and acute lower respiratory infections). Associations between air pollution and central nervous system diseases have also been shown,2Block ML Elder A Auten RL et al.The outdoor air pollution and brain health workshop.Neurotoxicology. 2012; 33: 972-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar but we believe that relatively little attention has been given to the possible role of pollution as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental (eg, schizophrenia) and neurodegenerative (eg, dementia) diseases. Therefore, we read with great interest the articles by Chen and colleagues3Chen H Kwong JC Copes R et al.Living near major roads and the incidence of dementia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis: a population-based cohort study.Lancet. 2017; 389: 718-726Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar in The Lancet and by Gao and colleagues in European Psychiatry.4Gao Q Xu Q Guo X Fan H Zhu H Particulate matter air pollution associated with hospital admissions for mental disorders: a time-series study in Beijing, China.Eur Psychiatry. 2017; (published online April 7.)http://doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.02.492Google Scholar The former was a large population-based cohort study conducted in Ontario, Canada, whose findings showed that urban residents, especially individuals living close to heavy traffic roads had an increased incidence of dementia. Notably, long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (â¤2Â·5 Î¼m in diameter; PM2Â·5) and nitrogen dioxide was positively associated with dementia. The latter study was a time-series analysis done in Beijing, China, investigating the acute effects of particulate matter on hospital admissions for mental disorders. The authors reported that elevated levels of PM10 (particulate matter â¤10 Î¼m in diameter), PM2Â·5, and PMC (2Â·5â10 Î¼m in diameter), were significantly associated with a small increase in hospital admissions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia evidently has a multifactorial (genetic and environmental) aetiology, and is a complex, and clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental syndrome, associated with variable functional impairments in social, emotional, perceptual, and cognitive domains.5Owen MJ Sawa A Mortensen PB Schizophrenia.Lancet. 2016; 388: 86-97Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar A biological association between schizophrenia and dementia has been debated for a long time, since Emil Kraepelin named schizophrenia as dementia praecox (premature dementia). The question of whether cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia is still a matter of debate. Evidence of deficits in multiple cognitive domains such as memory, attention, and visuospatial orientation, is noted in individuals with schizophrenia.6Ribe AR Laursen TM Charles M et al.Long-term risk of dementia in persons with schizophrenia. A Danish population-based cohort study.JAMA Psychiatry. 2015; 72: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Green MF Cognitive impairment and functional outcome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.J Clin Psychiatry. 2006; 67: 3-8PubMed Google Scholar Patients with schizophrenia show different degrees of cognitive impairment, and have poorer performance than healthy counterparts. Not infrequently, impairments in cognition can manifest years before the first psychotic episode, and usually cognitive dysfunctions are chronic.5Owen MJ Sawa A Mortensen PB Schizophrenia.Lancet. 2016; 388: 86-97Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar More recently, it has been proposed that schizophrenia could be a syndrome of accelerated ageing, suggesting that physiological abnormalities associated with schizophrenia could contribute to the increased mortality of individuals affected by this disorder.8Kirkpatrick B Messias E Harvey PD Fernandez-Egea E Bowie CR Is schizophrenia a syndrome of accelerated aging?.Schizophr Bull. 2008; 34: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar It has been furthermore shown that patients with schizophrenia have a substantially increased relative risk of dementia that could not be explained by established dementia risk factors, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.6Ribe AR Laursen TM Charles M et al.Long-term risk of dementia in persons with schizophrenia. A Danish population-based cohort study.JAMA Psychiatry. 2015; 72: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar A comprehensive hypothetical model may be explained by the presence of a progressive, neurodegenerative component in addition to a neurodevelopmental component in subjects with schizophrenia.5Owen MJ Sawa A Mortensen PB Schizophrenia.Lancet. 2016; 388: 86-97Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar The pathophysiological factors of the link between schizophrenia and dementia remain unclear. Urbanicity (being born or raised in cities) has been commonly described as one of the risk factors for schizophrenia and other non-affective psychosis, and pollution exposure (eg, exposure to xenobiotic heavy metals such as lead and cadmium, constituents of air pollution such as particulate matter, and nitrogen and sulphur oxides, organic solvents, and other constituents of environmental pollution) could potentially mediate the association between urbanicity and elevated risk, at least in part.9Attademo L Bernardini F Garinella R Compton MT Environmental pollution and risk of psychotic disorders: a review of the science to date.Schizophr Res. 2017; 181: 55-59Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar In our opinion, environmental pollution should be considered as a common risk factor for both dementia and schizophrenia. Studies are warranted to test this hypothesis, and if confirmed, the clinical implications could be of great importance for public and mental health. Future research, including large population-based studies, is likely to focus on investigation of the effects of specific components of environmental pollution on increased risk for mental, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative diseases in human beings, with the aim to plan possible prevention strategies. Policy measures, regulatory interventions, and aggressive air quality management programmes are needed to reduce current air pollution levels and the associated burden of disease, so bringing substantial health benefits across a broad spectrum of disease.10Cohen AJ Brauer M Burnett R et al.Estimates and 25-year trends of the global burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution: an analysis of data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015.Lancet. 2017; (published online April 10.)http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30505-6Google Scholar We declare no competing interests.",

    "ab": "The study in The Lancet Planetary Health by Tang and colleagues1Tang KL Caffrey NP NÃ³brega DB et al.Restriction in the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals and its associations with antibiotic resistance in food-producing animals and human beings: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Lancet Plan Health. 2017; 1: e316-e327Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar is an impressively comprehensive work on one of the most pressing health issues currently acknowledged worldwide: the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In this complex, multifactorial problem, the Article specifically focusses on the role of antimicrobial use on AMR in food-producing animals and human beings, which has become the subject of increased attention over the past decade.2European Centre for Disease Prevention and ControlEuropean Food Safety AuthorityEuropean Medicines AgencyECDC/EFSA/EMA first joint report on the integrated analysis of the consumption of antimicrobial agents and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from humans and food-producing animals.EFSA J. 2015; 13: 4006Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 3European Centre for Disease Prevention and ControlEuropean Food Safety AuthorityEuropean Medicines AgencyECDC/EFSA/EMA second joint report on the integrated analysis of the consumption of antimicrobial agents and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from humans and food-producing animalsâJoint Interagency Antimicrobial Consumption and Resistance Analysis (JIACRA) Report.EFSA J. 2017; 15: 4872Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar Though from an insider's point of view it might hardly seem surprising, this meta-analysis now unequivocally shows that reducing veterinary antimicrobial use leads to a decrease in AMR in animals; and also that veterinary antimicrobial use is not operating in an isolated animal setting but also affects the occurrence of AMR in human beings. Although the varying quality of the studies assessed in this analysis might justly be argued to weaken conclusions on an individual study level, the authors are right to highlight the consistency of their findings overall; hence, convincingly showing that any doubting or second guessing of these major conclusions is no longer defendable. Care should be taken to interpret the reported overall percentage decrease within the context of this study, From a scientific point of view, this study should be viewed as an extra stimulus to drive further researchâto unravel the many aspects that have emerged in recent years showing how complex the associations and roles of different reservoirs (eg, animals, in-contact humans, non-contact humans, and the environment) and different processes (eg, use of antimicrobials, development of resistance, spread of resistance, and transmission of resistance) are in reality.4Madec J-Y Haenni M Nordmann P Poirel L Extended-spectrum b-lactamase/AmpC- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in animals: a threat for humans?.Clin Microbiol Infect. 2017; (published online Jan 29.)DOI: 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.01.013Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar Although this study shows that a reduction in the use of antimicrobials in animals leads to a reduction of AMR in human beings, the question of exactly what is changing remains. An altered risk of transmission of AMR strains or determinants from animals to human beings seems the better explanation of the observations made, rather than a direct effect of development and spread of AMR in human beings.4Madec J-Y Haenni M Nordmann P Poirel L Extended-spectrum b-lactamase/AmpC- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in animals: a threat for humans?.Clin Microbiol Infect. 2017; (published online Jan 29.)DOI: 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.01.013Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar Molecular epidemiological studies should provide the necessary answers, and the effect of any such transmissions on the human resistome on the short and long term needs to be clarified. This discussion imposes an important warning: caution should be taken not to overly shift the focus of the problem of AMR in human beings on the use of antimicrobials in animals. It is important to call veterinary medicine to account for its role in the prevalence of human AMR, yet the exact role that the use of antimicrobials in animals has on human antimicrobial resitance is still insufficiently understood and should not be used to divert attention from the responsibilities in human medicine in relation to cautious antimicrobial use in humans. Another open question the authors identify is the benefit that can be expected from different interventions. In our opinion, the study somewhat under-exposes the very large policy differences existing in different regions of the world, and it might be interpreted as suggesting that banning use of antimicrobials, rather than reducing their use, might be the best answer. However, with such large policy differences, the results from the study by Tang and colleagues might be very differently interpreted in different regions. It seems only reasonable to advocate the prohibition of antimicrobial use in feed for growth promotion worldwide, as has been implemented in Europe for over a decade. At the same time, several countries, European as well as non-European, have shown that antimicrobial stewardship, on the basis of detailed information on antimicrobial use, AMR, or both, rather than strict inhibition, might lead to desired reductions).5European Medicines AgencyEuropean Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial ConsumptionSales of veterinary antimicrobial agents in 30 European countries in 2015.http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Report/2017/10/WC500236750.pdfDate: 2007Google Scholar, 6Dorado-GarcÃ­a A Mevius DJ Jacobs JJ et al.Quantitative assessment of antimicrobial resistance in livestock during the course of a nationwide antimicrobial use reduction in the Netherlands.J Antimicrob Chemother. 2016; 71: 3607-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7The Netherlands Veterinary Medicines InstituteUsage of antibiotics in agricultural livestock in the Netherlands in 2016.

Restricting the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals and its associations with antibiotic resistance in food-producing animals and human beings: a systematic review and meta-analysisInterventions that restrict antibiotic use in food-producing animals are associated with a reduction in the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in these animals. A smaller body of evidence suggests a similar association in the studied human populations, particularly those with direct exposure to food-producing animals. The implications for the general human population are less clear, given the low number of studies. The overall findings have directly informed the development of WHO guidelines on the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

The investigators showed that long-term exposure to black carbon was associated with an excess of longitudinal bone loss. They also showed that people living in areas with higher PM2Â·5 concentrations had a greater risk of osteoporotic fracture. Air pollution is considered the most important risk factor for mortality at the population level;2Landrigan PJ Air pollution and health.Lancet Public Health. 2017; 2: e4-e5Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar now we know that it is also a risk factor for osteoporosis. These findings, together with a previous study3Chang KH Chang MY Muo CH et al.Exposure to air pollution increases the risk of osteoporosis: a nationwide longitudinal study.Medicine (Baltimore). 2015; 94: e733Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and the development of the exposome concept,4Wild CP Complementing the genome with an \"exposome\": the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2005; 14: 1847-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar have pointed to a new and exciting area of research in the aetiology of osteoporosis. To appreciate the significance of these findings, it is important to consider the complex aetiology of osteoporosis and its consequence of fragility fracture in the general population. Osteoporosis is a systemic disease of the bone that affects a large number of people worldwide. Approximately one-third of women and one-tenth of men aged 50 years and older have osteoporosis or osteopaenia.5Looker AC Melton 3rd, LJ Harris TB Borrud LG Shepherd JA Prevalence and trends in low femur bone density among older US adults: NHANES 2005â2006 compared with NHANES III.J Bone Miner Res. 2010; 25: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar Atraumatic fracture is a consequence of osteoporosis. Among those aged 50 years, about one in two women and one in three men will sustain a fracture during their remaining lifetime.6Nguyen ND Ahlborg HG Center JR Eisman JA Nguyen TV Residual lifetime risk of fractures in women and men.J Bone Miner Res. 2007; 22: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar It has not been well recognised that individuals with a fracture have a higher risk of risk of mortality, and the risk is greater in men than in women.7Bliuc D Nguyen ND Milch VE Nguyen TV Eisman JA Center JR Mortality risk associated with low-trauma osteoporotic fracture and subsequent fracture in men and women.JAMA. 2009; 301: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar Those who survive a fracture are more likely to sustain another fracture and develop one or more of chronic pain, increased dependence, and reduced quality of life. Taken together, osteoporosis and its consequence of fracture represent a common and serious skeletal disorder that is expected to increase in magnitude over the next few decades as populations are rapidly ageing. Globally, WHO considers osteoporosis to be the second (only to cardiovascular disease) leading health problem. Research on osteoporosis has largely focused on two important outcomes: fracture and bone mineral density (BMD). A bone fracture occurs when a force exerted against a bone is greater than the bone can bear. Thus, reduced bone strength is the key determinant of fracture risk. Bone strength is, in turn, mainly determined by BMD and the microstructure of the bone. Low BMD is the strongest risk factor for fracture, with each SD lower BMD being associated with a 1Â·5â2Â·5-fold increase in fracture risk,8Marshall D Johnell O Wedel H Meta-analysis of how well measures of bone mineral density predict occurrence of osteoporotic fractures.BMJ. 1996; 312: 1254-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar a magnitude of association equivalent to the association between blood pressure and stroke. Therefore, BMD is operationally used to diagnose osteoporosis. However, in postmenopausal women and older men, BMD progressively declines with advancing age. Although the average rate of decline is modest (<1% per year),9Jones G Nguyen T Sambrook P Kelly PJ Eisman JA Progressive loss of bone in the femoral neck in elderly people: longitudinal findings from the Dubbo osteoporosis epidemiology study.BMJ. 1994; 309: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar the individual rates of bone loss are highly heterogeneous, with some individuals losing BMD excessively and some losing BMD in a gradual fashion. Moreover, excessive rate of bone loss is an important predictor of fracture risk independent of baseline BMD.10Nguyen TV Center JR Eisman JA Femoral neck bone loss predicts fracture risk independent of baseline BMD.J Bone Miner Res. 2005; 20: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar Therefore, there are good reasons to study factors influencing the variation in bone loss and fracture risk in the population at large. Over the past four decades, although considerable research has been devoted to biological and genetic risk factors, less attention has been paid to environmental factors. This is logical since studies of twins suggest that between 65% and 80% of the variation in BMD is determined by genetic factors.11Pocock NA Eisman JA Hopper JL Yeates MG Sambrook PN Eberl S Genetic determinants of bone mass in adults. A twin study.J Clin Invest. 1987; 80: 706-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar Intensive research over the past decade has identified more than 70 genetic variants associated with low BMD or fracture.12Estrada K Styrkarsdottir U Evangelou E et al.Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 56 bone mineral density loci and reveals 14 loci associated with risk of fracture.Nat Genet. 2012; 44: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar However, these variants account for less than 10% of variance in BMD and fracture risk, suggesting that genetic variation is not the major determinant of osteoporosis. This fact implies that research on osteoporosis should be broadened to examine the impact of environmental factors. In osteoporosis research, environmental factors are often understood as factors intrinsic to an individual such as lifestyle, diet, physical activity, and exposure to chronic stress. The influence of a bigger and more omnipresent factorâsuch as indoor and outdoor air pollutionâon osteoporosis has received little attention. There is good reason to study the impact of environmental pollutants on bone, because bone is a lifetime reservoir for heavy metals ingested by diets and exposed to external environmental factors. Lead and other toxic metals, such as cadmium, mercury, and aluminium,13Bellinger DC The protean toxicities of lead: new chapters in a familiar story.Int J Environ Res Pub Health. 2011; 8: 2593-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar are sequestered in the skeleton, binding with calcium in hydroxyapatite, as a biological 'toxic waste dump' throughout life. Indeed, more than 90% of the lead in the body resides in bones and teeth. Lead can exert its effect on bone directly and indirectly through decreased vitamin D concentrations, decreased bone-forming cells, and increased bone-resorbing cells. The increased production of bone-resorbing cells and reduced bone-forming cells lead to loss of bone and low bone mass (ie, osteoporosis). Emerging empirical evidence is consistent with a relationship between environmental pollution and osteoporosis. A registry-based study in Taiwan found that greater concentrations of air pollutants (ie, CO and NO2) were associated with progressively lower BMD.3Chang KH Chang MY Muo CH et al.Exposure to air pollution increases the risk of osteoporosis: a nationwide longitudinal study.Medicine (Baltimore). 2015; 94: e733Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar Furthermore, exposure to lead and cadmium is adversely associated with BMD and fracture risk.14Campbell JR Auinger P The association between blood lead levels and osteoporosis among adultsâresults from the third national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES III).Environ Health Perspect. 2007; 115: 1018-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar Nevertheless, it appears from these studies1Prada D Zhong J Colicino E et al.Association of air particulate pollution with bone loss over time and bone fracture risk: analysis of data from two independent studies.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e337-e347Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 3Chang KH Chang MY Muo CH et al.Exposure to air pollution increases the risk of osteoporosis: a nationwide longitudinal study.Medicine (Baltimore). 2015; 94: e733Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar that the impact of air pollution on fracture risk is modest, with the average relative risk being less than 1Â·1. However, given that a large proportion of the population is exposed to air pollution, the impact of such exposure on disease is substantial. Still, the finding of Prada and colleagues adds to the growing body of literature on the influence of air pollution on bone health in the general population. However, air pollution is only a constituent of endogenous and exogenous environmental factors that individuals are exposed to from the time of birth to the time of death. These exposures include, but are not limited to, pollutants, heavy metals, foods, drugs, and other toxic chemicals that affect tissues. The realisation of such lifetime exposures gives rise to the concept of the exposome, which is defined as the cumulative measure of all non-genetic exposures in an individual's lifetime.4Wild CP Complementing the genome with an \"exposome\": the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2005; 14: 1847-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar The demarcation of the effect of the exposome on diseases, including osteoporosis, is the next frontier of medical research. Fortunately, recent advances in mass spectrometry make it possible to profile the serum exposome by using metabolomics and proteomics. This unbiased quantification of environmental exposure can help discover non-genetic determinants of fracture. In summary, osteoporosis and its consequence of fragility fracture represent one of the most important public health problems worldwide, because fracture is associated with increased mortality. It is now clear that genetic factors account for a modest proportion of fracture cases and bone density variance, suggesting that an environmental profile in the form of the exposome is likely the main driver of the disease. Conceptually, an individual's risk of fracture is grounded by the individual's genome and modified by the individual's exposome. The delineation of the interaction between genome and exposome has the potential to transform our thinking about the aetiology of osteoporosis. I declare no competing interests. Association of air particulate pollution with bone loss over time and bone fracture risk: analysis of data from two independent studiesOur results suggest that poor air quality is a modifiable risk factor for bone fractures and osteoporosis, especially in low-income communities.

    "ab": "Transitions from rural to urban living are often prompted by promises of increased economic opportunities and cheaper health care, education, and transportation. However, these rural-to-urban transitions are often chaotic. Megacities, defined as rapidly developing urban centres with populations of 10 million or more, present a unique opportunity to study the future of planetary health and how to build a more resilient globe (figure). By 2030, two-thirds of the world's population will reside in urban areas and there will be 41 megacities, of which over 80% will be in low-income and middle-income countries. Megacities are characterised by substantial cultural, socioeconomic, and racial diversity, as well as environmental heterogeneity.2Patel RB Burke TF Urbanizationâan emerging humanitarian disaster.N Engl J Med. 2009; 361: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar We propose that future comprehensive studies of megacities should move beyond commonly identified single issues to consider the complex health sequelae of the natural and built environmental landscapes. For example, urban-built environments are often poorly equipped to provide stable sources of food for sustaining massive populations. In low-income and middle-income megacities, such as Dhaka, Bangladesh, food shortages and poverty result in increasing food prices and malnutrition.3Keck M Etzold B Bohle H Zingel W Food security in Dhaka: between global risks and local vulnerabilities.in: Kraas F Aggarwal S Coy M Mertins G Megacities: our global urban future. Springer, Dordrecht: Netherlands2014: 59-73Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar Additionally, many megacity inhabitants exhibit a shift towards more sedentary lifestyles and a western diet, leading to increased body-mass indices (BMIs) and instances of obesity and diabetes.4Saquib J Saquib Barry M Cullen M et al.Sex differences in obesity, dietary habits, and physical activity among urban middle-class Bangladeshis.Int J Health Sci (Qassim). 2016; 10: 363-372PubMed Google Scholar As urban residents transition from diets sustained on home gardens to rely on cheaper, processed foods, they are at a greater risk of developing obesity and other non-communicable diseases. Studies in China and Egypt have shown that breast cancer incidencesâcontrolled for screening biasesâwere substantially higher among urban women than among rural women. This difference in breast cancer incidences is postulated to be caused by increased exposure to xeno-oestrogens from processed foods, and higher BMIs and alcohol consumption in urban areas.5Fei X Wu J Kong Z Christakos G Urban-rural disparity of breast cancer and socioeconomic risk factors in China.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0117572Google Scholar, 6Dey S Soliman AS Hablas A et al.Urban-rural differences in breast cancer incidence by hormone receptor status across 6 years in Egypt.Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2010; 120: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar Megacities are also linked with increased instances of violent victimisation and gender-based violence. Urban women, in many instances the victims of violence, are at a higher risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections and HIV than their rural counterparts.7WHO World Health Organisation, Switzerland2010http://www.who.int/kobe_centre/publications/hiddencities_media/who_un_habitat_hidden_cities_web.pdf?ua=1Google Scholar The increased instances of violence in megacities can also contribute to deteriorating mental health within the population. A mental-health survey of the residents in the metropolitan area of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, found a higher prevalence of mental disorders than that found with similar surveys of residents in non-megacities.8Andrade L Walters E Gentil V Laurenti R Prevalence of ICD-10 mental disorders in a catchment area in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol. 2002; 37: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar Anxiety, mood, impulse-control, and substance-use disorders were all associated with crime-related traumatic events, particularly in women. Augmented violence in megacities results in increased imprisonments, leading to crowded epicentres for disease proliferation that pose a threat to adjacent populations. A study from 20159Sacchi FP PraÃ§a RM Tatara MB et al.Prisons as reservoir for community transmission of tuberculosis, Brazil.Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21: 452-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar reported that urban centres near prisons are at increased risk of contracting tuberculosis strains developed within those prisons.9Sacchi FP PraÃ§a RM Tatara MB et al.Prisons as reservoir for community transmission of tuberculosis, Brazil.Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21: 452-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar The indirect influence of megacity violence highlights the impact of megacities not only on their inhabitants, but also on the surrounding populations. Air pollution also has a substantial effect on the wellbeing of people worldwide. This pollution can consist of sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and fine-particulate matter of less than 2Â·5 Î¼m in diameter (PM2Â·5). 92% of the global population is exposed to higher-than-recommended concentrations of PM2Â·5, resulting in 3 million premature deaths per year. PM2Â·5 exposure is particularly high in megacities and can cause fatal diseases including stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer.10WHOAmbient air pollution: a global assessment of exposure and burden of disease. World Health Organisation, 2016http://who.int/phe/publications/air-pollution-global-assessment/en/Google Scholar Another atmospheric phenomenon is called the urban-heat-island effect, with megacities often being 5â11Â°C warmer than surrounding areas, and it is associated with increased incidences of dehydration, heat stroke, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.11Campbell-Lendrum D CorvalÃ¡n C Climate change and developing-country cities: implications for environmental health and equity.J Urban Health. 2007; 84: 109-117Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar These higher temperatures can also lead to increased use of cooling systems that release hydrofluorocarbons and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, further exacerbating the heat-island effect. Other challenges that are also associated with urban-built environments include overcrowding, a scarcity of open space, poor sanitation, and insufficient groundwater management. And challenges that are associated with urban-natural environments, in addition to air pollution, are extreme-weather events, such as floods and heat waves, and increased instances of urban-arboviral diseases with changing vector patterns that are caused by climate change. As human populations become increasingly concentrated in cities, understanding successful social and natural interventions in present-day megacities can help global-health practitioners to better manage our rapidly evolving planetary health for the future. To address food insecurity and the inability of many evolving megacities to be agriculturally independent, cities such as Singapore and New York City have trialled vertical-farming techniques. At the forefront of this technology is aeroponicsâa method for growing plants in stacks without sunlight or water.12Despommier D The vertical farm: feeding the world in the 21st century. Macmillan Press, London2010Google Scholar Using green technologies and urban designs, wastewater and rainwater can be recycled and stored to manage water safely in the age of megacities. Finally, megacity interventions should consider the heterogeneity of the city's population. By examining and disaggregating large datasets obtained from so-called smart cities, one can interpret the information to generate optimum methods of energy, food, and wastewater management to prevent so-called splintered cities, wherein goods are maldistributed to only the wealthier sections (Levitt R, Stanford University, CA, USA, personal communication). Considering the complex health sequalae of the natural and built environmental landscapes of megacities, planning to maintain the health of the populations of those cities and prepare them for a resilient future will rely on collaborations between many disciplines including social scientists, health professionals, and environmentalists.

    "ab": "BackgroundCardiovascular disease rates are known to increase immediately after a severe earthquake. However, less is known about the magnitude of this increase over time in relation to the amount of housing damage. We assessed the effect of area housing damage from a major earthquake sequence in Christchurch, Canterbury province, New Zealand, on cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions and deaths.MethodsFor this cohort-linkage study, we used linked administrative datasets from the Statistics New Zealand Integrated Data Infrastructure to identify individuals aged 45 years or older living in Christchurch from the date of the first earthquake on Sept 4, 2010. Individuals were assigned the average damage level for their residential meshblock (small neighbourhood generally comprising 10â50 dwellings) using the insurance-assessed residential building damage costs obtained from the Earthquake Commission as a proportion of property value. We calculated the rates of cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions (including myocardial infarction) and cardiovascular disease-related mortality and rate ratios (adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, small-area deprivation index, and personal income) by level of housing damage in the first year and the 4 subsequent years after the earthquake. The rate ratio association between earthquake housing damage and cardiovascular event was examined by Poisson regression, and linear test of trends across damage categories was done by regression modeling.FindingsWe identified 179 000 residents living in the earthquake-affected region of Christchurch, of whom 148 000 had complete data. For the first 3 months after the Feb 22, 2011 earthquake, the Poisson regression-adjusted rate ratio (RR) for cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions for residents from areas that were most damaged (compared with residents from the least damaged areas) was 1Â·12 (95% CI 0Â·96â1Â·32; test for linear trend p=0Â·239). In the first year after the earthquake sequence, for residents from areas that were most damaged (vs the least damaged areas), Poisson regression-adjusted RRs were 1Â·10 (1Â·01â1Â·21; test for linear trend p=0Â·068) for cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions, 1Â·22 (1Â·00â1Â·48; p=0Â·036) for myocardial infarction-related hospital admissions, and 1Â·25 (1Â·06â1Â·47; p=0Â·105) for cardiovascular disease-related mortality, corresponding to an excess of 66 (95% CI 7â125) cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions, including 29 (0â53) additional myocardial infarction-related hospital admissions and 46 (13â73) additional deaths from cardiovascular disease. In the 4 subsequent years, we found no evidence of an association of these outcomes with earthquake damage.InterpretationRates of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction were increased in people living in areas with more severely damaged homes in the first year after a major earthquake. Policy responses to reduce the effect of earthquake damage on cardiovascular disease could include pre-earthquake measures to minimise building damage, early wellbeing interventions within the first year to address post-earthquake stress, and enhanced provision of cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment services.FundingHealthier Lives National Science Challenge and Natural Hazards Research Platform, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.",

    "ab": "China experienced unprecedented heavy smog pollution in the winter of 2016â17. Northern Chinese areas surrounding Beijing suffered most seriously. At the beginning of 2017, the Ministry of Science and Technology of China started to implement a special focus research programme on the causes and control technology of air pollution with financial input of Â¥2Â·47 billion, and the Beijing Municipal Government released its 13th 5-year plan (2016â20) for environmental protection and ecosystem construction. Both events emphasised a series of plans, goals, and measures and aimed to understand why, how, and from where the smog arises. These questions are complicated to answer because the smog pollution has been attributed to various sources and mixed chemical reactions between the source pollutants.1Huang R Zhang Y Bozzetti C et al.High secondary aerosol contribution to particulate pollution during haze events in China.Nature. 2015; 514: 218-222Google Scholar, 2Zheng M Yan C Li X PM2Â·5 source apportionment in China.in: Hester R Harrison R Querol X Airborne particulate matter: sources, atmospheric processes and health. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge2016: 293-314Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar At the same time, concerns over the health effects of heavy smog pollution are rising, increasing the need to better understand the interlinkages. Existing knowledge on the health impacts of smog pollution is mostly based on statistical records of patients and mortalities, which are descriptive but lack deeper insights in the context of China. So far, no systematic understanding exists of the causal chain from smog conditions to human exposure and health outcomes (eg, diseases). Because there might be no immediate solution to stop smog pollution, it is especially important to reduce its impacts on humans as soon as possible.3Xu B Yang J Zhang Y Gong P Healthy cities in China: a Lancet Commission.Lancet. 2016; 388: 1863-1864Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar But recent strategies of addressing smog are overwhelmingly focusing on the physical conditions of smog exposure and not on the human side. One of the most pressing and urgent problems is that polluted air can severely endanger human health and life.4Chan M Solheim E Taalas P Working as one UN to address the root environmental causes of ill health.Bull World Health Organ. 2017; 95: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar Individual residents who are affected by smog pollution can often do very little to prevent it, but they can apply adaptive and protective measures to reduce their risk. At the individual level, although people cannot prevent the smog, they can diminish their exposure to it. For example, people often prefer to drive instead of taking public transport to be less exposed to open air, which however goes against the government strategy of encouraging less driving to mitigate emissions that contribute to smog pollution. The real situation is much more complicated, as many people change their normal lifestyles and habits in response to poor air quality, whereas others continue outdoor activities and wear a mask. Thus our understanding on actual behaviour patterns of urban individuals is insufficient, and typical Chinese daily lifestyles differ from western ones.5Feng J Dijst M Prillwitz J Wissink B Travel time and distance in international perspective: a comparison between Nanjing (China) and the Randstad (The Netherlands).Urban Studies. 2013; 50: 2993-3010Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Zhao Y Chai Y Kwan M Comparison of urban residents' travel behavior in China and the U.S.: a case study between Beijing and Chicago (in Chinese).Geogr Res. 2014; 33: 2275-2285Google Scholar Only a few studies have discussed the interlinkages of travel behaviour and exposure to smog pollution.7Guo W Zhang Y Chai Y Measurement of residents' daily travel air pollution exposure and its mechanism: A case study of suburban communities in Beijing (in Chinese).Geogr Res. 2015; 34: 1310-1318Google Scholar But they did not focus on the related health risks. Many key questions remain to be answered: how long and to what degree are different urban residents exposed to smog concentrations? How could the individual exposure be measured considering local people's typical daily life habits? How does the accumulated exposure affect the human respiratory system? How promising are people's spontaneous measures (eg, wearing a mask or using indoor air purifiers)? What are the best strategies to avoid and prevent smog impacts? To address knowledge deficits on these aspects, new scientific approaches are needed. Reduction of the health effects of smog will require a deeper understanding of the unprecedented complexity of exposure to smog pollution associated with individual actions.8Kulmala K Atmospheric chemistry: China's choking cocktail.Nature. 2015; 526: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar Very little is known about these effects, in particular in the Chinese urban environment, since they are strongly related to people's culture and habits that lead to specific daily activities and behaviours. In addition, the human body has some capacity to adapt to smog impacts, but there are thresholds. Cumulative exposures that exceed such thresholds will threaten health. It is a challenge to quantify the accumulation of exposures, which highly depends on individual daily routes and behavioural routines. It is also a challenge to identify the relevance of exposure to sickness, as well as the biochemical reactions of pollutants in the body. Many sectors of the Chinese society are acting to address the problem of smog pollution. Government departments have crafted several policies to reduce such issues as overconsumption of coal and energy and limit the number of cars on the road. Scientists are also actively proposing research projects for the coming years to investigate the sources and processes of smog development, to study the health effects of air pollution, and to improve technologies of monitoring, forecasting, warning, controlling, and managing.9Tang T Science and technology for smog control: where to spend the 2Â·47 billion CNY investment? (in Chinese).Science and Technology Daily. Jan 23, 2017; Google Scholar In many projects, indicators of fine particulate matter (<2Â·5 Î¼m) concentration, meteorological conditions, number of patients, and mortalities are to be monitored and studied. Apart from these actions, innovative and individual-based approaches are needed to assess accumulations of human exposure, study different behavioural patterns and responses of people, and understand the pollutants' impacts for specific physiological conditions of the human body. Priority actions include supporting individual-based monitoring and modelling of human exposure in urban context, assessing and improving the particulate-isolating efficiency of buildings and public facilities, and studying the effect of transportation infrastructures and travel patterns. Along with the development of positioning technology and big data resources generated in social media, combined with agent-based modelling and social network analysis, individual activities and their tracks could be recorded and analysed accurately. Combining these approaches with hospital patient reports and laboratory experiments will greatly help studying individual and collective exposure and health effects. Additional support is also needed to commit to reduce people's exposures immediately. Some options could be encouraging the change of household coal or gas cook stoves to electrical ones (to reduce indoor exposures), adopting a flexible (home-based and office-based) work system when possible, and also raising public awareness about exposure reduction. We believe that efforts in understanding and reducing exposure to smog offer a no-regret solution that reduces both individual health risks and particulate emissions. With these measures, we hope to improve understanding on the individual level health impacts of smog and reduce the actual health impacts, even if smog pollution itself is not mitigated in the near future. Smog pollution also happens in many other countries, including India and Brazil. Evaluation of public health intervention mechanisms and development of optimisation strategies could be used to reduce risks to specific groups globally. We declare no competing interests.

In the past 200 years, the proportion of the world's population living in cities has grown from about 5% to more than 50%.1McMichael AJ The urban environment and health in a world of increasing globalization: issues for developing countries.Bull World Health Organ. 2000; 78: 1117-1126PubMed Google Scholar By 2050, about 2Â·5 billion additional people will need to be housed in citiesâmore than 1 million people every weekâwith about 90% of the increase concentrated in Asia and Africa.2United NationsDepartment of Economic and Social AffairsPopulation DivisionWorld urbanization prospects: the 2015 revision. United Nations, New York2015https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Google Scholar Urban land cover is expected to increase by more than 1 million km2 by 2030, nearly tripling the global urban land area circa 2000, threatening biodiversity and affecting ecosystem productivity through loss of habitat, biomass, and carbon storage.3Seto KC GÃ¼neralpa B Hutyra LR Global forecasts of urban expansion to 2030 and direct impacts on biodiversity and carbon pools.PNAS. 2012; 109: 16083-16088Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar Urban ways of living are the keystone of modern human ecology.1McMichael AJ The urban environment and health in a world of increasing globalization: issues for developing countries.Bull World Health Organ. 2000; 78: 1117-1126PubMed Google Scholar Having evolved as hunter gatherers living in natural environments with ready access to a healthy diet and plenty of opportunity for physical activity in daily living, most Homo sapiens in the world are now living with a mismatch between their evolutionary biology and their environment.4Gluckman P Hason M Mismatch: The lifestyle diseases timebomb. Oxford University Press, Oxford2008Google Scholar Although, on average, the health of urban dwellers is better than rural dwellers, urban health inequities have been well documented.5Kjellstrom T Friel S Dixon J et al.Urban environmental health hazards and health equity.J Urban Health. 2007; 84: s86-s97Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar Associations between health and location have been studied since at least the time of Hippocrates. In ancient Roman civilisation, aqueducts brought clean water into the cities. Swamps were drained. With the dawn of the Anthropocene, rapid industrialisation and urbanisation in places such as England began to affect the health of urban residents, particularly those living in crowded and unsanitary conditions. Sir Edwin Chadwick and others successfully argued for urban reforms in the interest of public health. The contemporary discourse of urban health has mostly focused on the social determinants of health. Although the original ambition of the WHO Healthy Cities programme encompassed concern about the health of ecosystems,6Hancock T The evolution, impact and significance of the health cities/healthy communities movement.J Public Health Policy. 1993; 14: 5-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar in practice less attention was given to ecological foundations of health in most healthy city projects. In parallel, urban planning, transport, and engineering leaders have advanced a discourse on sustainable cities that, on the whole, has paid less attention to the human and social dimensions of sustainable development. It is essential to transcend these two separate discourses and take a more interdisciplinary, and integrative, approach to sustainable urban development.7UNU-IIGHPeople, planet and participation: the Kuching statement on healthy, just and sustainable urban development.Health Promot Intl. 2016; (published online June 26.)https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daw046Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar Concern about the human health impacts of toxic urban air pollution has fuelled a resurgence of global interest in the links between urbanisation and health. With almost 1 billion people living in slum households, a pressing need exists for action to address their high risks of infection and injury.8Ezeh A Oyebode O Satterthwaite D et al.The history, geography, and sociology of slums and the health problems of people who live in slums.Lancet. 2017; 389: 547-558Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar The large urban populations in river deltas of Asia are particularly vulnerable to inundation during extreme weather events.9Nicholls RJ Wong PP Burkett VR et al.Coastal systems and low-lying areas.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2007Google Scholar In this rapidly evolving context, the Sustainable Development Goals include a specific urban goalâGoal 11: Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. In October, 2016, the UN convened Habitat III, its third conference on housing and sustainable urban development. The goals and ambitions have been set. The challenge is implementation. Because cities are now the dominant human habitat, it is essential for health that they are fit for purpose. Cities are for people10Gehl J Cities for People. Island Press, Washington, DC2010Google Scholar and therefore human health, wellbeing, safety, security, and opportunity should be central considerations in sustainable urban development. All people share a set of universal health needs (panel)11Boyden S The Biology of civilisation: understanding human culture as a force in nature. University of New South Wales Press, Sydney2004Google Scholar and the ambition of urban governance should be to meet these needs in sustainable ways.PanelUniversal health needs of the human speciesBiophysical needsâ¢Clean airâ¢Clean waterâ¢A natural dietâ¢Absence of harmful levels of radiationâ¢A natural microbiomeâ¢Protection from extremes of climateâ¢A natural amount of physical activityâ¢SleepPsychosocial needsâ¢An emotional support networkâ¢The experience of convivialityâ¢Opportunities for co-operationâ¢A natural level of sensory stimulationâ¢An interesting environmentâ¢An aesthetically pleasing environmentâ¢Opportunities for creative behaviourâ¢Opportunities for learningâ¢Opportunities for recreationâ¢Opportunities for spontaneityâ¢Variety in daily experienceâ¢Absence of alienation and deprivationâ¢A sense of belonging, purpose, and love*Adapted with permission from Boyden.11Boyden S The Biology of civilisation: understanding human culture as a force in nature.

University of New South Wales Press, Sydney2004Google Scholar Context is important. No single model exists for sustainable and healthy urban development. Cities, rightly, should reflect their unique geographies, histories, economies, politics, and cultures. The discipline of human ecology is useful in understanding urban health challenges and thinking through solutions. Systems thinking can help bring expertise from different disciplines together with local knowledge for effective urban governance. Importantly, urban development is a political process and addressing the maladaptive political economy at play in many cities is fundamental to planetary health. Although more empirical research is doubtless needed, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, action is required on what is already known. The recent Lancet series on the health of people who live in slums8Ezeh A Oyebode O Satterthwaite D et al.The history, geography, and sociology of slums and the health problems of people who live in slums.Lancet. 2017; 389: 547-558Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar and urban design, transport, and health12Giles-Corti B Vernez-Moudon A Reis R et al.City planning and population health: a global challenge.Lancet. 2016; 388: 2912-2924Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar provide up to date policy research syntheses on key themes. Traditional knowledge can also be usefulâfor example, the experience of urban populations in North Africa dealing with extreme heat over millennia without air conditioning provides lessons for climate change adaptation in other regions. In 1992, the Secretary-General of the UN conference on environment and development declared that if our planet is to remain a hospitable and sustainable home for the human species, the battle would be won or lost in major urban areas. Much work remains to be done. In the interest of the wellbeing of current and future generations, we must re-think our current approach to urban development and governance to enable all people to flourish on our precious planet Earth.

    "ab": "We read with interest the Article by Alice Munro and colleagues,1Munro A Kovats RS Rubin GJ et al.Effect of evacuation and displacement on the association between flooding and mental health outcomes: a cross-sectional analysis of UK survey data.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e134-e141Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and have observed similar results in a cohort of 1615 New York residents affected by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Participants completed a questionnaire that measured mental health symptoms, Hurricane Sandy exposure, and displacement. The PHQ-4 depression scale was used to assess symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder and depression, the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Specific was used to assess symptoms of probable post-traumatic stress disorder specific to Hurricane Sandy, and the Perceived Stress Scale was implemented as a general measure of perceived stress.2Schwartz RM Sison C Kerath SM et al.The impact of Hurricane Sandy on the mental health of New York area residents.Am J Disaster Med. 2015; 10: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar The mean time since Hurricane Sandy was 14Â·47 months (SD 3Â·26, range 11Â·81â27Â·93). In this cohort, displaced participants (729 [45%]) were more likely to have symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2Â·21, 95% CI 1Â·73â2Â·82), depression (1Â·37, 1Â·05â1Â·79), anxiety (1Â·30, 1Â·01â1Â·67), and increased perceived stress (Î² value 1Â·16, SE 0Â·38) compared with non-displaced participants, after adjusting for age, sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, previous mental health conditions, and time since Hurricane Sandy.3Schwartz RM, Rasul R, Kerath S, et al. Displacement during Hurricane Sandy: the impact on mental health. J Emerg Manag (in press).Google Scholar We have since re-interviewed 130 participants from the original cohort in a follow-up study.4Schwartz RM Gillezeau CN Liu B Lieberman-Cribbin W Taioli E Longitudinal impact of Hurricane Sandy exposure on mental health symptoms.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2017; 14: E957Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar The mean time since Hurricane Sandy was 33Â·27 months (SD 5Â·28, range 27Â·73â43Â·75). Experiencing personal and property damage during Hurricane Sandy continued to be positively associated with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms at follow-up (adjusted OR 1Â·2, 95% CI 1Â·1â1Â·4). Of the 130 participants who were re-interviewed, 50 (38%) were displaced because of Hurricane Sandy. At baseline, displacement was statistically significantly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (adjusted OR 3Â·72, 95% CI 1Â·47â9Â·42), but not with anxiety or depression. At follow-up, displacement was not statistically significantly associated with symptoms of anxiety (1Â·52, 0Â·65â3Â·59), depression (1Â·32, 0Â·52â3Â·34), or post-traumatic stress disorder (1Â·23, 0Â·46â3Â·32).4Schwartz RM Gillezeau CN Liu B Lieberman-Cribbin W Taioli E Longitudinal impact of Hurricane Sandy exposure on mental health symptoms.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2017; 14: E957Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar The results suggest an attenuated mental health effect of displacement 2â3 years after Hurricane Sandy. Longitudinal studies with larger samples might be better powered to detect the effect of displacement on the mental health of those affected by hurricanes. We recognise the importance of understanding the impact of displacement and exposure on short-term and long-term mental health symptoms, and concur with Munro and colleagues1Munro A Kovats RS Rubin GJ et al.Effect of evacuation and displacement on the association between flooding and mental health outcomes: a cross-sectional analysis of UK survey data.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e134-e141Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar that mental health services should be strengthened for those who are displaced because of natural disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy in the USA or the extensive flooding in England. Additionally, there are many potential disaster preparedness policy implications that can be drawn from this research, including increasing funding for short-term crisis management services to those who are displaced. Research reported in this letter was supported by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under award number U01-TP000573-01, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response under HITEP 150029-01-00, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials under ASTHO 64-45471, the Stony Brook-Mount Sinai Alliance Pilot Project, and a private gift given to Northwell Health.

Effect of evacuation and displacement on the association between flooding and mental health outcomes: a cross-sectional analysis of UK survey dataDisplacement after flooding was associated with higher reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder 1 year after flooding. The amount of warning received showed evidence of being protective against symptoms of the three mental illnesses studied, and the severity of flooding might be the reason for some, but not all, of the differences between the groups.

    "ab": "Ambient air pollution is a global public health challenge, especially for developing countries such as China and India.1Cohen AJ Brauer M Burnett R et al.Estimates and 25-year trends of the global burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution: an analysis of data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1907-1918Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar Among various pollutants, particulate matter often shows the strongest evidence for adverse health effects.2Pope 3rd, CA Dockery DW Health effects of fine particulate air pollution: lines that connect.J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2006; 56: 709-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (4030) Google Scholar Particulate matter consists of discrete particles that range in size over several orders of magnitude. In many countries, inhalable particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 Î¼m, PM10) and fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2Â·5 Î¼m, PM2Â·5) have been regarded as criterial pollutants because several studies have documented the adverse health effects of PM10 and PM2Â·5. Size is an important determinant of health effects of particulate matter. Previous epidemiological studies suggested that PM2Â·5 has stronger effects on cardiorespiratory disorders than PM10.2Pope 3rd, CA Dockery DW Health effects of fine particulate air pollution: lines that connect.J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2006; 56: 709-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (4030) Google Scholar However, there is very limited knowledge regarding which specific size fraction below 2Â·5 Î¼m is mainly responsible for the observed health effects. Thus, it has been of great interest, both from a scientific viewpoint and from a regulatory perspective, to investigate which specific size fractions below PM2Â·5 are more toxic than others. Recently, PM1 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 1 Î¼m), as a major part of PM2Â·5, has received more and more attention. In The Lancet Planetary Health, a nationwide study by Gungbo Chen and colleagues3Chen G Li S Zhang Y et al.Effects of ambient PM1 air pollution on daily emergency hospital visits in China: an epidemiological study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e221-e229Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (129) Google Scholar provides new evidence about the relation between PM1 and increased risk for emergency hospital visits in 26 Chinese cities.3Chen G Li S Zhang Y et al.Effects of ambient PM1 air pollution on daily emergency hospital visits in China: an epidemiological study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e221-e229Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (129) Google Scholar Thanks to a national monitoring network of PM1, the authors were able to conduct the first multi-city epidemiological study of PM1 in developing countries or even in the world. Interestingly, PM1 was found to have similar effects on emergency hospital visits as PM2Â·5 (relative risks [RRs] 1Â·011 [95% CI 1Â·006â1Â·017] and 1Â·010 [1Â·005â1Â·016], for a 10 Î¼g/m3 increase in PM1 and PM2Â·5, respectively, at lags 0â2 days) and the attributable fraction of emergency hospital visits due to PM1 (4Â·47%) approached that due to PM2Â·5 (5Â·05%). Moreover, PM1â2Â·5 was not significantly associated with emergency hospital visits, suggesting that the health effects of PM2Â·5 were mostly from PM1. The findings are consistent with a previous study in Shanghai, China showing that, compared with PM1â2Â·5, PM1 had much stronger associations with circulating biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation, and vasoconstriction in a panel of young adults.4Chen R Zhao Z Sun Q et al.Size-fractionated particulate air pollution and circulating biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation and vasoconstriction in a panel of young adults.Epidemiology. 2015; 26: 328-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Together these findings suggest that PM1 has adverse effects on the health of the general population and strengthen the rationale for restricting levels of PM1 in outdoor air. The stronger effects of smaller particlesâeg, PM1âis probably due to higher pulmonary deposition efficiency, easier vascular penetration, larger surface area, as well as more toxic components adhered. As the authors have pointed out, this new study has limitations that need to be addressed in future studies. The authors used the monitoring results from only one fixed-site monitoring station as a proxy for population exposures to PM1 and were not able to assess spatial variation of PM1. Several approaches, including statistical models of measurement error and use of personal exposure assessment, can be used to address this issue.5Zeger SL Thomas D Dominici F et al.Exposure measurement error in time-series studies of air pollution: concepts and consequences.Environ Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar The authors did not have information about causes of emergency hospital visits limiting this study's ability to identify subgroup morbidity outcomes associated with PM1 exposure. Finally, it is difficult to differentiate the effects of PM1 and PM2Â·5 on emergency hospital visits in view of the high association between the two pollutants. Historically, evidence from epidemiological studies of air pollution has played a pivotal part in regulatory policy making and standards setting. So far, the standards for PM1 have not been proposed by WHO or any other government agencies. Is it the right time to propose the standards for PM1? The answer is probably no, because the knowledge we have for PM1 is still far from enough. Clearly, more studies are needed for PM1 in both developed and developing countries. More studies are warranted to determine the characteristics of exposure to PM1 to investigate the independent health effects of PM1 from other pollutantsâeg, PM2Â·5âas well as to identify the most susceptible time periods and population groups, and pathophysiological link between PM1 and cardiorespiratory diseases. I declare no competing interests. Effects of ambient PM1 air pollution on daily emergency hospital visits in China: an epidemiological studyExposure to both ambient PM1 and PM2Â·5 were significantly associated with increased emergency hospital visits. The results suggest that most of the health effects of PM2Â·5 come from PM1. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "BackgroundMycobacterium ulcerans infection is the third most common mycobacterial disease in the world after tuberculosis and leprosy. To date, transmission pathways from its environmental reservoir to humans are still unknown. In South America, French Guiana has the highest reported number of M ulcerans infections across the continent. This empirical study aimed to characterise the epidemiology of M ulcerans infection in French Guiana between 1969 and 2013.MethodsData were collected prospectively mainly by two dermatologists at Cayenne Hospital's dermatology department between Jan 1, 1969, and Dec 31, 2013, for age, date of diagnosis, sex, residence, location of the lesion, type of lesion, associated symptoms, and diagnostic method (smear, culture, PCR, or histology) for all confirmed and suspected cases of M ulcerans. We obtained population data from censuses. We calculated mean M ulcerans infection incidences, presented as the number of cases per 100 000 person-years.Findings245 patients with M ulcerans infections were reported at Cayenne Hospital's dermatology department during the study period. M ulcerans infection incidence decreased over time, from 6Â·07 infections per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 4Â·46â7Â·67) in 1969â83 to 4Â·77 infections per 100 000 person-years (3Â·75â5Â·79) in 1984â98 and to 3Â·49 infections per 100 000 person-years (2Â·83â4Â·16) in 1999â2013. The proportion of children with infections also declined with time, from 42 (76%) of 55 patients in 1969â83 to 26 (31%) of 84 in 1984â98 and to 22 (21%) of 106 in 1999â2013. Most cases occurred in coastal areas surrounded by marshy savannah (incidence of 21Â·08 per 100 000 person-years in Sinnamary and 21Â·18 per 100 000 person-years in Mana). Lesions mainly affected limbs (lower limbs 161 [66%] patients; upper limbs 60 [24%] patients). We diagnosed no bone infections.InterpretationThe decrease of M ulcerans infection incidence and the proportion of children with infections over a 45 year period in this ultra-peripheral French territory might have been mostly driven by improving living conditions, prophylactic recommendations, and access to health care.FundingAgence Nationale de la Recherche.",

Previous systematic reviews have yielded convincing evidence of the effect of short-term exposure to particulate matter on cardiorespiratory mortality and hospital admissions, including for myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke.6Mustafic H Jabre P Caussin C et al.Main air pollutants and myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.JAMA. 2012; 307: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 7Shah AS V Langrish JP Nair H et al.Global association of air pollution and heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Lancet. 2013; 382: 1039-1048Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 8Shah AS V Lee KK McAllister DA et al.Short term exposure to air pollution and stroke: systematic review and meta-analysis.BMJ. 2015; 350: h1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Newell and colleagues add to the scientific literature by focusing specifically on LMICs and potential variations in magnitude across LMIC regions. The most notable finding from the systematic review is the very small number of studies of long-term exposure. Of 91 studies meeting the eligibility criteria, only four were studies of long-term exposure derived from two Chinese populations, providing estimates based on PM10 but not PM2Â·5. The meta-analysis included only studies relating day-to-day variation in air pollution and daily counts of deaths and hospital admissions from time-series and case-crossover studies. Among the studies included in the meta-analysis, only one was available for Africa. In cases for which enough studies were available to compare estimates between LMIC regions, estimates were larger for Latin America and the Caribbean compared with east Asia and the Pacific for several outcomes, including respiratory and stroke mortality. Whether observed differences in effects are due to differences in particle concentrations or composition, population vulnerability, or cause of death determination across countries is unclear and warrants further research. This systematic review5Newell K Kartsonaki C Lam KBH Kurmi O Cardiorespiratory health effects of particulate ambient air pollution exposure in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e368-e380Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar brings the paucity of studies linking long-term exposure to PM2Â·5 and cardiorespiratory mortality and morbidity at exposure levels above those seen in North American and western Europe into sharp focus. This paucity of research in LMICs is one of the main limitations in the evolving Global Burden of Disease effort to estimate attributable burdens to air pollution.1Cohen AJ Brauer M Burnett R et al.Estimates and 25-year trends of the global burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution: an analysis of data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1907-1918Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar At present, the Global Burden of Disease estimates for PM2Â·5 are based on integrated exposure response functions combining estimates from cohort studies of long-term exposure in high-income countries (with relatively low exposures) with passive and active smoking to approximate the global exposure range.9Burnett RT Pope 3rd, CA Ezzati M et al.An integrated risk function for estimating the global burden of disease attributable to ambient fine particulate matter exposure.Environ Health Perspect. 2014; 122: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar A clear need exists for more direct epidemiological evidence of long-term exposure at high pollution levels in view of the high likelihood that relationships are not linear. Estimates from short-term exposure studies, such as those included in the meta-analysis by Newell and colleagues, shed limited light on the burden of disease in LMICs because the effects from short-term exposures are smaller than the effects from long-term exposures,10Brook RD Rajagopalan S Pope CA et al.Particulate matter air pollution and cardiovascular disease. An update to the scientific statement from the American Heart Association.Circulation. 2010; 121: 2331-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (4531) Google Scholar resulting in an underestimation of the full effect of air pollution on cardiorespiratory health. Filling this gap in the epidemiological evidence will require advances in the estimation of long-term exposure to particulates in LMICs. Substantial challenges remain in the adaptation of exposure models used for large population studies in high-income countries to LMIC settings. Ambient monitoring is less available in LMICs than in high-income countries, and what is available, rarely covers rural areas. Additionally, LMICs tend to have greater diversity of local sources of air pollution (eg, crop and trash burning, biomass-fuel use, and culturally specific sources), which are difficult to capture with routinely available land-use or remote-sensing data. Present knowledge suggests the relation between particulate matter and cardiovascular and respiratory mortality flattens out at higher exposure levels.1Cohen AJ Brauer M Burnett R et al.Estimates and 25-year trends of the global burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution: an analysis of data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1907-1918Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar The systematic review by Newell and colleagues5Newell K Kartsonaki C Lam KBH Kurmi O Cardiorespiratory health effects of particulate ambient air pollution exposure in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e368-e380Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar covered cities with mean PM2Â·5 levels ranging from 56 Î¼g/m3 to 179 Î¼g/m3 (43â142 Î¼g/m3 for PM10). The authors could have taken their analysis further to investigate the shape of the exposureâresponse relationship over this broad range, shedding light on the extent to which mean concentration contributed to the substantial heterogeneity reported across studies.

    "ab": "One of the key lessons that can be learnt from the history of public health is that many major public health advancesâfrom clean drinking water to tobacco controlâhave been led at the local level. As we enter the Anthropocene, and strive to embrace an ecosocial approach that can address the implications for population health of the global ecological changes humans are creating,1Hancock T Capon A Dietrich U Patrick R Governance for health in the Anthropocene.Int J Health Gov. 2016; 21: 245-262Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar once again much of the leadership and action will need to occur at the local level. This position does not deny the need for global-level action to address boundary-spanning issues such as climate change, ozone depletion, or persistent organic pollutants (three examples for which international agreements have recently been made). Unfortunately, such global-level action is usually time-consuming and fraught with difficulties. Meanwhile, local governments have often shown more commitment and been quicker to act.2Pancost R Cities lead on climate change.Nat Geosci. 2016; 9: 264-266Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar Earth's human population is now mostly urban, with almost 55% of people living in cities, a proportion expected to grow to 66% by 2050.3United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population DivisionWorld urbanization prospects: the 2014 revision (ST/ESA/SER.A/366). United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, New York2015Google Scholar Cities produce about 80% of global gross domestic product,4UN HabitatUrbanization and development: emerging futures (world cities report 2016). UN Habitat, Nairobi2016Crossref Google Scholar and are responsible for more than 75% of natural resource consumption, 60â80% of energy consumption, and 75% of global carbon emissions.5Steiner A Foreword.in: Swilling M Robinson B Marvin S Hodson M. City-level decoupling: urban resource flows and the governance of infrastructure transitions. summary for policy makers. UNEP, Nairobi2013Crossref Google Scholar It can, therefore, be argued that the battle for planetary health will be won or lost in the world's cities. One way to understand the scale of human impact on the Earth is the ecological footprint (EF).6Wackernagel M Rees W Our ecological footprint: reducing human impact on the earth. New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, BC; Philadelphia, PA1996Google Scholar Globally, the EF exceeded the Earth's biocapacity (put simply, the Earth's capacity to produce resources and ecological services) in about 1970, and as of 2012 had grown to 1Â·6 times that figure, even though in that period biocapacity itself grew slightly due to increased agricultural productivity.7WWF InternationalLiving planet report 2016.in: Risk and resilience in a new era. WWF International, Gland, Switzerland2016Google Scholar Moreover, high-income countries (HICs) required 6Â·2 global hectares per person in 2012, which was 3Â·6 times the available biocapacity of 1Â·7 global hectares per person.7WWF InternationalLiving planet report 2016.in: Risk and resilience in a new era. WWF International, Gland, Switzerland2016Google Scholar In other words, people living in HICs require, on average, 3â4 planet's worth of biocapacity to sustain present ways of living. Because this situation is unsustainable, we must learn to live on the one small planet that is our home, but in a way that also ensures a good quality of life, and a long and healthy life, for all. This predicament has led to the concept of so-called One Planet living, in which all individuals, communities, and nations have to abide by inherent resource constraints.7WWF InternationalLiving planet report 2016.in: Risk and resilience in a new era. WWF International, Gland, Switzerland2016Google Scholar, 8Bioregional, One planet living. http://www.bioregional.com/oneplanetliving/ (accessed March 25, 2017).Google Scholar The challenge is particularly hard for people living in HICs because of the need to reduce their ecological footprint by up to 75%. However, HICs have a responsibility and ethical duty to do just this for several reasons: they have become the model to which many people in many other countries aspire, and they take far more than their fair share of the Earth's resources and have done so for many decades, if not centuries. The transformation in societies, economies, and ways of life to achieve One Planet living represents a key 21st century population health challenge. International movements are already based on local approaches to these issues, such as Healthy Cities, Sustainable Cities, and the Transition Network, but effective co-ordination between and integration of health and sustainable development is frequently not prioritised.9Patrick R Dooris M Poland B Healthy cities and the transition movement: converging towards ecological well-being?.Glob Health Promot. 2016; 23: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar Because of One Planet living's concern to address both life quality and wellbeing and the EF, it offers an integrative approach with the potential to release synergies at local and regional levels. Bioregional, a UK-based charity and social enterprise working around the world with developers and municipal governments, among others, created its One Planet Living initiative in 2003.8Bioregional, One planet living. http://www.bioregional.com/oneplanetliving/ (accessed March 25, 2017).Google Scholar Its ten One Planet Principles (panel) begin with health and happiness and also address other social concerns (eg, culture and community, equity and local economy) in addition to environmental and urban planning focus areas.PanelOne Planet Principlesâten principles for local and global sustainable livingHealth and happinessEncourage active, social, meaningful lives to promote good health and wellbeing.Equity and local economyCreate safe, equitable places to live and work, which support local prosperity and international fair trade.Culture and communityNurture local identity and heritage, empowering communities and promoting a culture of sustainable living.Land and natureProtect and restore land for the benefit of people and wildlife.Sustainable waterUse water efficiently, protecting local water resources and reducing flooding and drought.Local and sustainable foodPromote sustainable humane farming and healthy diets high in local, seasonal organic food and vegetable protein.Travel and transportReduce the need to travel and encourage walking, cycling, and low carbon transport.Materials and productsUse materials from sustainable sources and promote products and services that help people reduce consumption.Zero wasteReduce consumption, and reuse and recycle to achieve zero waste and zero pollution.Zero carbon energyMake buildings and manufacturing energy efficient and supply all energy with renewables.Reproduced with permission from 8Bioregional, One planet living. http://www.bioregional.com/oneplanetliving/ (accessed March 25, 2017).Google Scholar.

There is also a pressing need to change the way societal and community progress is measured to more accurately reflect an ecosocial approach to health. We are thus interested in applying the Happy Planet Index (HPI) at a community as well as at a national level. The HPI, an innovative measure developed by the New Economics Foundation,10New Economics Foundation The happy planet index http://happyplanetindex.org (accessed March 25, 2017).Google Scholar measures precisely what population and planetary health is interested in: life quality (life expectancy Ã life satisfaction Ã equity factor) per unit of ecological footprint. Each of the authors is working locally to convene key partners and explore what our local regions would look like if they had an EF of One Planet and a high quality of life, using the HPI at a local level to assess progress. Our intent is that planetary health understanding informs local action in the interest of the health and wellbeing of future generations, which makes it a vitally important task for public health in the 21st century.

    "ab": "Over the past decade, a growing number of studies have linked urban green space and aspects of biodiversity with emotional wellbeing. Although the existing body of epidemiological work has been very encouragingâcollectively providing a strong argument that access to areas rich in vegetation, bodies of water, or both is important for mental healthâmuch of the research relies heavily on cross-sectional designs. Thus, the translation and application of existing research to policy and planning decisions has been hampered by the scarcity of prospective evidence of natural environments as a causative factor in promoting mental health resilience. In The Lancet Planetary Health, Andrew Tomita and colleagues1Tomita A Vandormael AM Cuadros D Green environment and incident depression in South Africa: a geospatial analysis and mental health implications in a resource-limited setting.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e153-e163Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (50) Google Scholar strengthen this evidence by combining satellite-measurements of green space with depression outcomes in a large population in South Africa followed up over time. Globally, urbanisation is advancing at a rapid pace, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Decision makers, and the communities they represent, have much to consider when planning ahead for the arrival of an estimated 1Â·35 billion additional people to cities around the world within the next 15 years.2Seto KC GÃ¼neralp B Hutyra LR Global forecasts of urban expansion to 2030 and direct impacts on biodiversity and carbon pools.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2012; 109: 16083-16088Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar Choices made today will undoubtedly affect personal, public, and planetary health. There is therefore a tremendous need for policy and practice to be driven by the best available evidence. Historically, planning decisions in the context of public health have been driven by research in the areas of safety, security, sanitation, ease of transport, and social factors such as affordable housing. With shifting global disease burdens from infectious causes toward an epidemic of non-communicable diseasesâcoincident with climate change and biodiversity lossesâfactors such as access to healthy, nutritious food and stable, sustainable, and healthy ecosystems are now included in the recent Vienna Declaration on Public Health.3McKee M Stuckler D Zeegers Paget D Dorner T The Vienna declaration on public health.Eur J Public Health. 2016; 26: 897-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar It is becoming increasingly clear that biodiverse, vegetation-rich green spaces are important assets for public health in the era of urbanisation.4Jennings V Larson L Yun J Advancing sustainability through urban green space: cultural ecosystem services, equity, and social determinants of health.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2016; 13: 196Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar Although residential proximity and equitable access to natural environments have been linked to reduced risk of cardiometabolic disorders, their association with emotional wellbeing seems particularly strong.5Nieuwenhuijsen MJ Khreis H Triguero-Mas M Gascon M Dadvand P Fifty shades of green: pathway to healthy urban living.Epidemiology. 2017; 28: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar Indeed, some researchers have argued that green space may be \"equigenic\", in that equitable access can help to curb the consistency with which socioeconomic inequalities and disadvantages translates into in mental health disorders such as depression.6Mitchell RJ Richardson EA Shortt NK Pearce JR Neighborhood environments and socioeconomic inequalities in mental well-being.Am J Prev Med. 2015; 49: 80-84Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar Evidence supports the notion that sensory exposure to aspects of the natural environmentâor actually spending time in nature versus urban, built environmentsâimproves cognitive restoration, decreases oxidative stress, and lowers markers of stress physiology and low-grade inflammation.7Cox DT Shanahan DF Hudson HL et al.Doses of nearby nature simultaneously associated with multiple health benefits.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2017; 14: E172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Song C Ikei H Miyazaki Y Physiological effects of nature therapy: a review of the research in Japan.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2016; 13: E781Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar Although evidence supporting the importance of natural environments is growing more robust,9McEachan RR, Prady SL, Smith G, et al. The association between green space and depressive symptoms in pregnant women: moderating roles of socioeconomic status and physical activity. J Epidemiol Community Health; 70: 253â59.Google Scholar large prospective studies remain sparse. Tomita and colleagues make an important contribution to the argument for incorporating nature into the urban environment. Taking advantage of the South African National Income Dynamics Study and mental health data collected via the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, they were able to determine whether vegetation-rich land surrounding the homeâmeasured via the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI)âaffected incident depression over time. The authors found that, for middle-income South Africans, greenness surrounding the home was a predictor of lower incident depression. Tomita and colleagues did not find a connection between green living environments and lowered risk of depression among South Africa's low-income populations. The apparent lack of benefit of greenness in relation to depression among these disadvantaged individuals is, arguably, the most intriguing finding of the study. Such a finding, which the authors suggest could be due to the overwhelmingly larger negative issues associated with poverty, together with land dispossession and marginalisation, demands further research. One of its primary goals of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is to \"ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\".10United Nations Development ProgrammeSustainable development goals (SDGs).http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/Date: 2015Google Scholar In the contemporary urban environment, public health research provides evidence-based guidance to limit exposure to toxins and to promote a built environment that fosters a healthy lifestyle.11Child ST Schoffman DE Kaczynski AT Forthofer M Wilcox S Baruth M Neighborhood attributes associated with the social environment.Am J Health Promot. 2016; 30: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar Against the background of climate change, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss, public health has become planetary health and vice versa, and virtually every branch of science and medicine must be allied in this new reality. This will help to strike a balance between socioeconomic development and sustainability. As urbanisation proceeds at its rapid pace, the temptation is strong to simply translate the existing research into the notion that more green is better. But to what extent does increasing the amount of green space contribute to gentrification and marginalisation of the groups it was intended to benefit?12Kabisch N Haase D Green justice or just green? Provision of urban green spaces in Berlin, Germany.Landsc Urban Plan. 2014; 122: 129-139Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar More information is needed about land use than vegetation indexes currently provide, such as details on biodiversity. Addressing inequitable access to biodiversity and natural environments is a matter of \"ecological justice\".13Prescott SL Logan AC transforming life: a broad view of the developmental origins of health and disease concept from an ecological justice perspective.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2016; 13: E1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar It will be very difficult to retrofit green space if neighbourhoods expand with steel, cement, and glass alone. Urban planners, public health professionals, multidisciplinary teams, and local communities must work together to plan ahead for mental health and quality of urban life in a changing world. We declare no competing interests. Green environment and incident depression in South Africa: a geospatial analysis and mental health implications in a resource-limited settingOur results imply the importance of green environments for mental wellbeing in sub-Saharan African settings experiencing rapid urbanisation, economic and epidemiological transition, reaffirming the need to incorporate environmental services and benefits for sustainable socioeconomic development.

    "ab": "Increased global temperatures as a result of climate change can have a number of effects on human health, and it is important to know how these will vary across the globe. In The Lancet Planetary Health, Antonio Gasparrini and colleagues1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e437Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar comprehensively calculate projections of temperature-related mortality under varying climate change scenarios across 451 locations in 23 countries. Their findings suggest that by the end of the century, under defined scenarios, a net increase will occur in temperature-related excess mortality in the absence of efforts to limit global warming. A key message from this work is that high-emission climate change scenarios could have varying impacts in different regions of the world. Increases in heat-related mortality will be greatest under high-emission scenarios in the warmer and poorer regions, including central and southern America and southeast Asia. With the burden highly dependent on greenhouse gas emissions, the authors argue the importance of mitigation policies to limit emissions and reduce net temperature-related excess mortality.1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e437Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar Although mitigation will reduce the emissions, policies are highly reliant on current political environments and economic barriers to social acceptance, and, to date, the slow pace of global action has failed to impede the observed warming trend. Adaptation was not accounted for in the study, yet projected heat-related impacts would be expected to be lower if humans, like many other species, adapt to changing environmental conditions. Indeed, in warmer regions of the world identified in this study,1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e437Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar adaptation will probably be the primary means of prevention against the health impacts of climate change. However, adaptive capacity varies greatly between different populations, communities, and individuals, depending on levels of vulnerability, resilience, and available resources.2McMichael AJ Globalization, climate change, and human health.N Engl J Med. 2013; 368: 1335-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar Approaching adaptation from a collectivist viewpoint fails to acknowledge these differences. Means to boost adaptive capacity therefore might require careful consideration by local decision makers because no one size fits all. Adaptation plans can benefit from an interdisciplinary approach at the local level. This approach can encompass a sociological understanding of community health under climate change, with adaptation strategies formulated through good governance combined with community engagement and community-based participatory approaches.3Sullivan J Parras B St Marie R et al.Public talks and science listens: a community-based participatory approach to characterizing environmental health risk perceptions and assessing recovery needs in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.Environ Health Insights. 2009; 3: 37-51Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar The small islands in the Asia-Pacific region facing numerous climate change threats are a case in point. There, planning has included building climate-resilient health systems, addressing health governance and surveillance, and prevention and control measures for climate-sensitive diseases.4Kim R Costello A Campbell-Lendrum D Climate change and health in Pacific island states.Bull World Health Organ. 2015; 93: 819Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar Adaptation plans and health vulnerability assessments formulated through stakeholder engagement and interdisciplinary collaboration are part of the developed framework for action on climate change in the region.5McIver L Kim R Woodward A et al.Health impacts of climate change in Pacific island countries: a regional assessment of vulnerabilities and adaptation priorities.Environ Health Perspect. 2016; 124: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar In developing countries with warm, tropical climates, outdoor workers will be particularly at risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality as global warming ensues. Studies in Central America and Thailand, for example, have shown that heat exposure results in losses in work capacity and a range of acute and chronic health outcomes in workers.6Lundgren K Kuklane K Gao C Holmer I Effects of heat stress on working populations when facing climate change.Ind Health. 2013; 51: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar Occupational adaptation and prevention measures will become more salient, and should not be overshadowed by productivity concerns. For more affluent countries, the impacts of climate change will still be evident, albeit less harsh than in poorer countries. Where individuals have ready access to health-care professionals, tailored advice could be provided about heat health as a form of so-called precision adaptation. Ideally, precision adaptation to climate change would take into account individual and regional variability, in much the same way as the precision medicine concept has become a novel approach to prevention and treatment in the clinical setting.7Collins FS Varmus H A new initiative on precision medicine.N Engl J Med. 2015; 372: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar Adaptive health professionals could aid in the reduction of vulnerability to climate change in those whose health can be compromised in hot conditions, including those with pre-existing conditions often associated with ageing, and those facing socioeconomic disadvantage. One argument is that medical educators should integrate climate change into the medical curriculum to better enable physicians to have this adaptive expertise.8Bell E Horton G Blashki G Seidel BM Climate change: could it help develop 'adaptive expertise'?.Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract. 2012; 17: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Maxwell J Blashki G Teaching about climate change in medical education: an opportunity.J Public Health Res. 2016; 5: 673Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar This could encompass a diverse content of course material including global climate risks, eco-health, health promotion, and emergency preparedness, thereby equipping graduating health professionals with problem-solving skills to manage human health in the face of climate change-driven emergencies and extreme weather events.9Maxwell J Blashki G Teaching about climate change in medical education: an opportunity.J Public Health Res. 2016; 5: 673Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar This work by Gasparrini and colleagues1Gasparrini A Guo Y Sera F et al.Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e360-e437Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar will be valuable to researchers and policymakers in planning for the adverse health impacts of climate change in their region. No other study has examined such a breadth of locations using this methodology, and the evidence generated could be informative for global leaders, highlighting the urgent need for mitigation policies to limit further warming. However, as pointed out by the authors, large expanses of the world were not considered. If data were to become available, further research should be undertaken to include countries in the Indian subcontinent and sub-Saharan Africa to gain a broader view of global health effects. Regional estimates of other health impacts on an increasing and ageing global population would also be useful in forward planning for, and adaptation to, a warmer climate. We declare no competing interests. Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenariosThis study shows the negative health impacts of climate change that, under high-emission scenarios, would disproportionately affect warmer and poorer regions of the world. Comparison with lower emission scenarios emphasises the importance of mitigation policies for limiting global warming and reducing the associated health risks. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "âIt is easier to build a strong child than to repair broken menâ, is a statement widely attributed to Frederick Douglass, whose early years in slavery had given him a poor start in life. Our early years matter because the environment shapes our future health and resillience to unhealthy environments later in life. The risks to a child's health if the mother is obese, smokes during pregnancy, or develops pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes, or if the child's diet is high in sugar, salt, and trans-saturated fat, are well known.1Gluckman PD Hanson MA Cooper C Thornburg KL Effect of in utero and early-life conditions on adult health and disease.N Engl J Med. 2008; 359: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar However, the unrecognised risks to the health of future generations are increasingly concerning. WHO2WHOInheriting a sustainable world? Atlas on children's health and the environment. World Health Organization, Geneva2017Google Scholar has published an Atlas on children's health and the environment, noting that â26% of the deaths of 5Â·9 million children who died before reaching their fifth birthday could have been prevented through addressing environmental risksâa shocking missed opportunityâ. Environmental risks such as air pollution, contaminated food and water, and exposure to environmental toxic substances, can affect developing organs and physiological systems at all critical life stages, from the embryo through childhood and into adolescence (figure). The ability of tissues to repair damages and the opportunities to reverse any detrimental effects decreases with age. Although the prevalence of morbidities such as asthma and obesity are increasing in childhood, the effects of some conditions caused by the environment might not manifest until many years later. For example, in low-income and middle-income countries, an adverse environment during childhood might prevent 43% of children from reaching their full neurocognitive potential.3Black MM Walker SP Fernald LC et al.Early childhood development coming of age: science through the life course.Lancet. 2017; 389: 77-90Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar An assessment of disease risk at different life stages indicates that governmental health policies should focus on the health of young people, especially since adolescents account for nearly one fifth of the world's population.4UNICEFProgress for children: a report card on adolescents Number 10. UNICEF, New York2012Google Scholar Although the UN General Comment 4 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that âadolescents are in general a healthy population groupâ,5UN Committee on the Rights of the ChildGeneral comment No. 4 (2003): adolescent health and development in the context of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.https://www.unicef-irc.org/portfolios/general_comments/GC4_en.doc.htmlDate: 2003Google Scholar they can be on a high-risk trajectory to develop non-communicable diseases,6Twig G, Yaniv G, Levine H, et al. Body-mass index in 2Â·3 million adolescents and cardiovascular death in adulthood. N Engl J Med; 374: 2430â40.Google Scholar even if they appear outwardly healthy. Importantly, many adolescents at high risk do not have access to primary health care because of their place in society and thus are unlikely to be informed about the risks to their health. Moreover, we now understand that individuals can pass the risk of non-communicable diseases to their children, for example via epigenetic mechanisms. These biological processes can occur before the mother knows she is pregnant and accesses health care, and so the cycle of risk is perpetuated. A new WHO initiative aims to highlight how early life exposure to environmental toxic substances can be avoided and has proposed a plan to address the issue. WHO already has detailed information on various environmental toxicants from many reports7PrÃ¼ss-UstÃ¼n A Wolf J CorvalÃ¡n C Bos R Neira M Preventing disease through healthy environments: a global assessment of the burden of disease from environmental risks. World Health Organization, Geneva2016Google Scholar and their initiative calls for this information to be better communicated to all health-care professionals, alongside new WHO-supported educational packages. Public health departments and communities need to be better informed about how exposure to toxicants during early life is of concern and can be minimised or avoided altogether. At an individual level, education of men and women before they conceive a child is an ideal opportunity to promote awareness of healthy habits. Daily exposure to environmental toxicants can cause bioaccumulation, which, in a pregnant mother, can expose her unborn child to higher than expected concentrations of toxicant and produce additive effectsâthis phenomenon occurs even if the level of exposure to or concentration within the mothers' body of the toxicant is considered safe, if an acceptable level of exposure is known. Additionally, fathers are not excluded: bioaccumulation of toxins can affect offspring development via epigenetic effects on the sperm.8Estill MS Krawetz SA The epigenetic consequences of paternal exposure to environmental contaminants and reproductive toxicants.Curr Envir Health Rep. 2016; 3: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar The Sustainable Development Goals9UNSustainable Development Goals.https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgsGoogle Scholar can be achieved through environmental prevention of diseases without an additional burden on resources. The WHO avoidable early environmental exposures initiative emphasises that the unrecognised health risks are most damaging to the human population. An absence of overt developmental abnormalities, however, does not necessarily imply all is well. Recognition of the importance of exposure to hazardous environmental factors should be a core component of the training of health-care professionals. This training should be coupled with primary prevention measures set by governments to protect populations and public education to reduce individual exposure, which are essential to ensure the future health of the global population.

    "ab": "Urbanisation is one of the leading global trends of the 21st century and the UN predicts that seven in ten people will live in urban areas by 2050.1UN Department of Economic and Social AffairsThe 2014 revision. United Nations, New York2014Google Scholar With hasty global urbanisation, the importance of understanding relationships between environment, human health, and wellbeing is being increasingly recognised. Urban advance offers many opportunities, including access to better health care; however, this growth is also associated with many emerging environment and health hazards. Over the past decades, urbanisation and subsequent changes in our living standards, lifestyles, and dietary patterns have been suggested to be associated with different exposures and the risk of disease.2WHOBulletin of the World Health Organization, Urbanization and health.http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/4/10-010410/en/Date: 2010Google Scholar An increasing number of studies are investigating the effect of urban density and land-use mix on health gains, including reduced levels of obesity, and aim to identify types of neighbourhoods or characteristics of neighbourhoods that will promote health benefits.3Croucher KL Wallace A Duffy S The influence of land use mix, density and urban design on health: Centre for Housing Policy. University of York, York2012Google Scholar However, uncertainty regarding the effect of urbanisation on obesity remains due to discrepancies in conceptual and methodological approaches in urban definitions. In this issue of The Lancet Planetary Health, Chinmoy Sarkar and colleagues4Sarkar C Webster C Gallacher J Association between adiposity outcomes and residential density: a full-data, cross-sectional analysis of 419 562 UK Biobank adult participants.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e277-e288Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar report their findings on the association between adiposity and residential density using objective measures of the built environment. In a large and diverse population in the UK, they provide evidence for a curvilinear doseâresponse relationship indicating inflexion points at 1800 and 3200 residential units per km2. Findings were consistent across measures of adiposity, with stronger associations being found for people who were female, younger, and accumulating higher levels of physical activity.4Sarkar C Webster C Gallacher J Association between adiposity outcomes and residential density: a full-data, cross-sectional analysis of 419 562 UK Biobank adult participants.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e277-e288Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar This beneficial urban environment is particularly important because, irrespective of geographical location, residential density seems to be associated with decreased levels of obesity.5Rundle A Diez Roux AV Free LM Miller D Neckerman KM Weiss CC The urban built environment and obesity in New York City: a multilevel analysis.Am J Health Promot. 2007; 21: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar This association suggests that high-density areas can provide and support increased levels of physical activity because they have nearby destinations that support walking.6Witten K Geographies of obesity: environmental understandings of the obesity epidemic. Ashgate Publishing, Farnham2010Google Scholar Taken together these findings inform policies and practices aiming to create healthier cities through optimisation of urban planning and built environment design and to reduce health expenses by decreasing urban detrimental exposures. Unfortunately, the urban neighbourhood effect might not be always beneficial for the obesity risk. First, the increased urbanisation associated with high residential density, street intersections, and mixed land-use, together with low physical activity, increases reliance on foods that are often highly processed and containing high levels of salt, sugar, and fat.7Kim J Shon C Yi S The relationship between obesity and urban environment in Seoul.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2017; 14: 898Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8Pouliou T Elliott SJ Individual and socio-environmental determinants of overweight and obesity in urban Canada.Health Place. 2010; 16: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Sobal J Commentary: globalization and the epidemiology of obesity.Int J Epidemiol. 2001; 30: 1136-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar Second, the complex interaction between human beings and urbanisation is dependent, not only on individual determinants and behaviours such as gender, age, social or economic resources, and lifestyle, but also on urbanisation landscapes, including air pollution, handiness of green areas and recreational facilities, neighbourhood safety, and opportunities for mobility and physical activity.10Papas MA Alberg AJ Ewing R Helzlsouer KJ Gary TL Klassen AC The built environment and obesity.Epidemiol Rev. 2007; 29: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 11Brody J The global epidemic of childhood obesity: poverty, urbanization, and the nutrition transition. Nutrition Bytes.http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/1xb9x54zDate: 2002Google Scholar Therefore, to be effective in promoting health and healthy behaviour, public health interventions have to address not only individual characteristics but also the physical and social environment.1UN Department of Economic and Social AffairsThe 2014 revision. United Nations, New York2014Google Scholar The complexity of the linkages between urbanisation, environmental change, and human health and wellbeing requires a systems approach towards these factors. The study by Sarkar and colleagues4Sarkar C Webster C Gallacher J Association between adiposity outcomes and residential density: a full-data, cross-sectional analysis of 419 562 UK Biobank adult participants.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e277-e288Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar provides us with an improved understating of how the urban environment and land use can affect a complex chronic disease such as obesity. In fact, the rewiring of public health and urban planning is an opportunity to understand the effect of urbanisation and many other urban exposures on health, providing information to build up successful community-based disease prevention efforts. Ultimately, it is not only who you are, but also, and mostly, where and how you live that affects your health. We declare no competing interests. Association between adiposity outcomes and residential density: a full-data, cross-sectional analysis of 419 562 UK Biobank adult participantsHousing-level policy related to the optimisation of healthy density in cities might be a potential upstream-level public health intervention towards the minimisation and offsetting of obesity; however, further research based on accumulated prospective data is necessary for evidencing specific pathways. The findings might mean that governments, such as the UK Government, who are attempting to prevent suburban densification by, for example, prohibiting the subdivision of single lot housing and the conversion of domestic gardens to housing lots, will potentially have the effect of inhibiting the conversion of suburbs into more healthy places to live.

    "ab": "Climate change is without doubt one of the major threats facing public health. While we are already experiencing extreme weather events worldwide, the longer term impacts on health will include increased heat-related mortality, increased food-borne disease, and increased risk of vector-borne and water-borne disease.1 Coupled with increasingâand mobileâpopulations and antimicrobial resistance, the pressures on health systems will be substantial. Is it surprising then that the Paris Agreement formally linked human and planetary health so clearly and sought to harness leadership from the health sector to achieve robust change? It is in this light that efforts to assess the carbon footprinting of different elements of health care are needed.",

    "ab": "Human beings are an integral part of ecological systems and human health is dependent on the health of the planet. These interdependencies have been recognised for centuries within the discipline of traditional ecological knowledge of indigenous populations.1Finn S Herne M Castille D The value of traditional ecological knowledge for the environmental health sciences and biomedical research.Environ Health Perspect. 2017; 125: 085006Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar In occidental science, these ideas were conceptualised in the 1950s by environmental psychologists. The theory of biophiliaâan inherent love of natureâsuggests that human beings feel safe and recover from stress in natural settings because of our evolutionary origins from the African savannah.2Wilson EO Biophilia: the human bond with other species. Harvard University Press, Cambridge1984Google Scholar Other theories propose that our capacity for directed attention is depleted unless we can achieve effortless attention in nature (ie, a fascination) as a way of avoiding mental fatigue.3Kaplan R Kaplan S The experience of nature: a psychological perspective. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1989Google Scholar Although a few early studies provided some empirical support for these theories, it was not until the 21st century that the field gained interest among environmental health scientists, and findings from epidemiological studies4Mitchell R Popham F Effect of exposure to natural environment on health inequalities: an observational population study.Lancet. 2008; 372: 1655-1660Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar have now indicated an association between green spaces and various health outcomes or health-promoting behaviours such as physical activity. However, the physiological effects of nature exposure are still not fully known. In the Lancet Planetary Health, Dan Crouse and colleagues5Dan L Crouse Lauren Pinault Adele Balram et al.Urban greenness and mortality in Canada's largest cities: a national cohort study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e289-e297Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar showed a relation between increased urban greenness and decreased cause-specific mortality among urban Canadians in a national cohort of approximately 1Â·3 million adults. This sample size made it one of the larger studies in the field and it improved on existing evidence by including a follow-up of 10 years during which patterns of residential mobility were tracked. The researchers assigned estimates of greenness exposure to participants derived from a remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), then estimated hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% CIs per IQR (0Â·15) increase in NDVI, showing a significantly decreased risk for all causes of mortality (non-accidental HR 0Â·915, 95% CI 0Â·905â0Â·924; cardiovascular plus diabetes 0Â·911, 0Â·895â0Â·928; cardiovascular 0Â·911, 0Â·894â0Â·928; ischaemic heart disease 0Â·904, 0Â·882â0Â·927; cerebrovascular 0Â·942, 0Â·902â0Â·983; and respiratory 0Â·899, 0Â·869â0Â·930), even with adjustment for covariates that might influence longevity, such as age, sex, and marital status. Can this reduced mortality be attributed to recovery from stress or mental fatigue, as postulated in earlier theories? Chronic stress is indeed a significant risk factor for several non-communicable diseases and related mortality.6McEwen BS Stress, adaptation, and disease: allostasis and allostatic load.Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1998; 840: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar A prolonged stress reaction results in a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukins resulting in chronic inflammation.7Cohen S Janicki-Deverts D Doyle WJ et al.Chronic stress, glucocorticoid receptor resistance, inflammation, and disease risk.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2012; 109: 5995-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar This eventually causes oxidative stress, damaging the DNA of mitochondria, and increases the risk for premature death.8Epel ES Psychological and metabolic stress: a recipe for accelerated cellular aging.Hormones. 2009; 8: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar If green space exposure does prevent stress, it might explain the reduced mortality from several of the causes that the investigators describe. Most studies have shown that exposure to nature might contribute to acute stress relief,9Annerstedt M JÃ¶nsson P WallergÃ¥rd M et al.Inducing physiological stress recovery with sounds of nature in a virtual reality forestâresults from a pilot study.Physiol Behav. 2013; 118: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar but the effect on chronic stress remains to be explored. Urban green spaces also provide ecosystem services10Millennium ecosystem assessment programEcosystems and human well-being. Island Press, Washington DC2005Google Scholar from biodiverse ecosystems that are the ultimate premises for human health and survival, possibly explaining the association between green spaces and health. For example, exposure to microbial biodiversity is necessary for the development of many organ systems and for regulation of the immune system. In modern urban environments, with scarce access and exposure to biodiverse green spaces, there is a risk of depletion of this immunoregulatory service.11Rook GA Regulation of the immune system by biodiversity from the natural environment: an ecosystem service essential to health.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2013; 110: 18360-18367Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar The failure of immune system regulation has consequences in the form of a wide range of inflammatory diseases, which are currently increasing in urbanised high-income countries.12Dunder T Tapiainen T Pokka T Uhari M Infections in child day care centers and later development of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis: prospective follow-up survey 12 years after controlled randomized hygiene intervention.Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2007; 161: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar Regulatory and cultural ecosystem services in cities contribute to reduction of the urban heat island, better air quality, and opportunities for social and physical activities. These services can act as mediators between green spaces and health and might contribute to reduced mortality. Crouse and colleagues5Dan L Crouse Lauren Pinault Adele Balram et al.Urban greenness and mortality in Canada's largest cities: a national cohort study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e289-e297Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar were able to adjust for several environmental covariates, including PM2Â·5, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, but noted these only had a small confounding effect on the green space HRs. Thus, in this case, it seems as if greenness has a protective effect that is independent of air quality. The evidence around green spaces and health is still fragmented for most specific outcomes and is often difficult to interpret because of the different metrics used. By linking the NDVI, which can be standardised across the world, to mortality data in a well designed statistical study, Crouse and colleagues5Dan L Crouse Lauren Pinault Adele Balram et al.Urban greenness and mortality in Canada's largest cities: a national cohort study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e289-e297Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar have contributed to further advancing the field, as it will now be possible to replicate their study in various geographical regions with different socioeconomic and cultural conditions. The sociocultural, and possibly genetic, mosaic in multiethnic Canada provides an interesting ground for forthcoming studies in specific populations. By contrast with previous research,4Mitchell R Popham F Effect of exposure to natural environment on health inequalities: an observational population study.Lancet. 2008; 372: 1655-1660Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar Crouse and colleagues5Dan L Crouse Lauren Pinault Adele Balram et al.Urban greenness and mortality in Canada's largest cities: a national cohort study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e289-e297Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar showed the strongest protective effects were in people who could already be assumed to be in a healthier population segmentâie, people in relationships with higher incomes and education. The investigators hypothesise that this result could be from a higher exposure to greenness in these groups, due to easier access to green spaces in wealthier areas and self-selection. Future studies should build on the approaches of Crouse and colleagues5Dan L Crouse Lauren Pinault Adele Balram et al.Urban greenness and mortality in Canada's largest cities: a national cohort study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e289-e297Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar to assess the potential of urban green spaces as inherently health-promoting assets in cities. We also need to invest in controlled, experimental research, to investigate pathways and biological mechanisms behind green space exposure and human health outcomes. By combining these kinds of studies, a better understanding can be reached of how and why nature is important for health and longevity. I declare no competing interests Urban greenness and mortality in Canada's largest cities: a national cohort studyIncreased amounts of residential greenness were associated with reduced risks of dying from several common causes of death among urban Canadians. We identified evidence of inequalities, both in terms of exposures to greenness and mortality risks, by personal socioeconomic status among individuals living in generally similar environments, and with reasonably similar access to health care and other social services. The findings support the development of policies related to creating greener and healthier cities. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

They built a cohort of 2Â·2 million military veterans with no previous history of kidney disease using records from the US Department of Veterans Affairs and linked data on place of residence with data on ambient concentrations of airborne coarse particulates (PM10), nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide pollution. Over a median follow-up of 8Â·52 years, the authors found significant, positive associations between annual mean concentrations of each of these pollutants and increased incidence of eGFR less than 60mL/min per 1Â·73 m2, eGFR decline of 30% or more, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease. To assess the significance of these findings for public health, the authors calculated the fraction of kidney disease in the American population attributable to air pollution. They found that PM10 pollution is responsible for 10Â·14% of incident eGFR of less than 60 mL/min per 1Â·73 m2, 9Â·97% of chronic kidney disease, 11Â·62% of eGFR decline of 30% or more, and 12Â·73% of end-stage renal disease. These rates translate to around 765 000 new cases of eGFR less than 60 mL/min per 1Â·73 m2 and to nearly 30 000 new cases of end-stage renal disease attributable each year in the USA to ambient air pollution. Although these observations will need to be corroborated by future studies, they underscore the importance of the connections between ambient air pollution and NCDs. However, pollution-related NCDs are surprisingly neglected in both the international development and global health agendas.3Landrigan PJ, Fuller R, Acosta NJR, et al. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health. Lancet (in press).Google Scholar Development funding from international agencies and donor countries for prevention of disease caused by ambient air pollution and other forms of modern industrial chemical and automotive pollution in LMICs is meagre.

Pollution-related NCDs are a growing global threat that can no longer be ignored. International agencies and the donor community must substantially increase the amount of funding and technical assistance that they direct to prevention of NCDs caused by pollution by the industrial, transport, chemical, and mining sectors in LMICs. Data systems must be strengthened. Vested interests must be confronted. WHO must accelerate their efforts to make interventions against pollution core components of the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases and translate this global strategy into health and pollution action plans for individual countries.14WHOPreventing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) by reducing environmental risk factors.http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/258796/1/WHO-FWC-EPE-17.01-eng.pdf?ua=1Google Scholar Fortunately, many of the tools needed to control pollution and to prevent pollution-related disease have already been developed. These strategies have been field-tested in high-income and middle-income countries, proven successful, and found to be highly cost-effective. They are based in law, policy, regulation, and technology; are based on the polluter-pays principle; and eliminate government subsidies for polluting industries. They include mandated reductions in emissions, strictly enforced air-quality standards, incentivised transitions to non-polluting, renewable sources of energy and to non-polluting production technologies, and they encourage public transportation. These strategies are available to be adopted globally. Their application can enable LMICs to advance over the health and ecological disasters that have previously plagued industrial development.

    "ab": "The study by Jesse Berman and colleagues1Berman JD Ebisu K Peng RD Dominici F Bell ML Drought and the risk of hospital admissions and mortality in older adults in western USA from 2000 to 2013: a retrospective study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e17-e25Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar published in The Lancet Planetary Health is the first to systematically analyse the risk of hospital admissions and mortality associated with drought periods in the USA. As the authors state, this is an understudied topic, but of great concern in the USA and globally as climate change is expected to worsen the severity and frequency of droughts in various regions. The Article breaks new ground by using US Medicare hospital admissions data and death certificates to assess changes in daily risk of cardiovascular-related and respiratory-related hospital admissions and mortality during periods of drought as measured by the US Drought Monitor. Its findings of increased mortality during periods of high severity worsening drought and decreased respiratory admissions during periods of full drought open the discussion about how drought affects health and just how severe and significant those effects are. One area that remains to be investigated is what measures or characteristics of drought are most predictive of health effects? Berman and colleagues discuss the complexity of this question, noting that there are 150 different drought measures in the scientific literature. For their study, the authors compared days of two different severity classes of drought and noted when the US Drought Monitor was progressively worsening for a given county. Unexplored dimensions in the present study include droughts of different duration or repetition; droughts in desert regions versus droughts in agricultural or more temperate regions; health-related exposures that occur as dry regions experience heavy rainfall and come out of drought; and droughts in areas that experience them most frequently. The authors chose to control for start season of the drought in their analysis but do not report whether droughts that started at different times of year had different health effects. This would be of some interest as well. Lastly, because the authors were using counties as their own comparison for drought versus non-drought periods, they chose to eliminate counties with a frequency of drought versus non-drought days of 1:1 or greater. This precluded analysis of the health effects for those counties with the highest frequency of drought, which could enhance understanding of magnitude and mechanisms of impacts. Future studies might explore comparison of multiple drought exposure methods and models, similarly to what has been done for heat.2Dong W Zeng Q Ma Y Li G Pan X Impact of heat wave definitions on the added effect of heat waves on cardiovascular mortality in Beijing, China.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2016; 13: 933Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Kent ST McClure LA Zaitchik BF Smith TT Gohlke JM Heat waves and health outcomes in Alabama (USA): the importance of heat wave definition.Environ Health Perspect. 2014; 122: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 4Smith TT Zaitchik BF Gohlke JM Heat waves in the United States: definitions, patterns and trends.Clim Change. 2013; 118: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar Another question clearly not answered by this study is what are the health effects of drought in people younger than 65 years, including susceptible populations like outdoor workers and children? Although the population aged 65 years and older will include some active and working individuals, the use of Medicare data makes these susceptibility factors and other populations difficult to assess. Finally, the study's approach of using a daily time series to analyse respiratory-related and cardiovascular-related hospital admissions and all-cause mortality at the county level has limited the types of health effects that can be assessed. The daily time series is a good method for observing small changes in high frequency health events, but is not as good at observing moderate increases in rare events. As such, the associations between drought and specific causes of mortality, and other types of diseases and injuries, especially the variety of infectious diseases that have been associated with drought and rainfall in other regions, remain to be investigated. As a useful pioneering study should, the study by Berman and colleagues raises and helps define more questions than it answers. With Earth observations indicating increasing variability in precipitation patterns around the globe, the need to understand the health effects of drought is as great as the need to understand the health effects of flooding and extreme precipitation. This study confirms that severe drought is associated with harm to human health and helps identify useful directions for future research. I declare no competing interests. Drought and the risk of hospital admissions and mortality in older adults in western USA from 2000 to 2013: a retrospective studyDrought conditions increased risk of mortality during high-severity worsening drought, but decreased the risk of respiratory admissions during full drought periods among adults aged 65 years and older. Counties that previously had fewer drought events show larger risk for mortality and cardiovascular disease.

    "ab": "In December, 2016, consecutive waves of major smog shrouded China, particularly the North China Plain and Sichuan Basin, resulting in suspended schools, halted industrial production, and heavy traffic. Atmospheric levels of fine particulate matter (PM2Â·5) spiked to more than 500 Î¼g/m3 in Henan and 1000 Î¼g/m3 in Shijiazhuang.1China DailySmog spreads out as readings spike.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-12/20/content_27716831.htmGoogle Scholar Beijing even issued a red alert for pollution levels between Dec 16, 2016, and Dec 22, 2016. What causes smog events is under debate. According to new research,2Cheng Y Zheng G Wei C et al.Reactive nitrogen chemistry in aerosol water as a source of sulfate during haze events in China.Sci Advan. 2016; 12: e1601530Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar nitrogen dioxide and water vapour combine through a complex chemical chain reaction to form a sulphate-rich haze. Analysis of the chemical compositions of particulate matter suggests that its main sources include central heating, vehicle emissions, and road dust.3Chen R Cheng J Lv J et al.Comparison of chemical compositions in air particulate matter during summer and winter in Beijing, China.Environ Geochem Health. 2016; (published online Aug 8)https://doi.org/10.1007/s10653-016-9862-9Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar In the past decade, scientific evidence seemed to favour vehicle emissions as the main culprit behind smog in China. Nevertheless, these observations have overlooked the proportion of nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, and particulate matter that is released by heavy industry. In fact, manufacturing of iron and steel, cement plants, coal combustion, and refinement of petroleum were proven to be the main sources of particulate matter leading to wintertime smog in Beijing.4Wang K Tian H Hua S et al.A comprehensive emission inventory of multiple air pollutants from iron and steel industry in China: temporal trends and spatial variation characteristics.Sci Total Environ. 2016; 559: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar As such, heavy industry is more likely to be a greater source of intensive pollutant emissions than vehicles. Many heavy industrial enterprises in northern China emit excessive amounts of pollutants that are rich in sulphur dioxide and particulate matter, the ingredients of haze. More crucially, some industrial enterprises secretly release emissions at night, which is a prominent issue that is difficult to regulate. Reduction of anthropometric emissions is the most viable way to mitigate air pollution. Public attention should be immediately shifted back to implementing feasible urgent interventions. Suspension of heavy industry production might offer temporary relief but does not target the issue at its root. China has established stringent laws to curb industrial pollutant emission but is confronted with poor implementation. Stringent and unannounced inspections should be used to identify and fine industrial corporations emitting excessive amounts of pollutants (particularly those responsible for clandestine night-time emissions); however, it is important that these measures are implemented before, not after, smog has occurred.5Lin YC Hsu SC Chou CC et al.Wintertime haze deterioration in Beijing by industrial pollution deduced from trace metal fingerprints and enhanced health risk by heavy metals.Environ Pollut. 2016; 208: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar Cleaner energy, such as solar energy and wind power, advocated by president Jinping Xi, is an appealing approach to reduce pollutant emissions but entails substantial financial burden requiring governmental investment and public support. China needs to abandon its convention of waiting for pollutants to cause a problem before managing their emission. The causes of major smog in China seem to be multifacetedâand include meteorological factors. However, excessive emissions from industrial enterprises remain crucial sources of air pollutants in northern China. Actions with integrated measures, including bundled composite interventions (eg, industrial upgrading and use of cleaner energy) and more stringent inspections according to environmental protection laws, are urgently needed.

Regulations on scooter emission lagged behind for a long time, yet promising policy developments seem to be imminent. Strict European Union regulations effective from 2018 onwards will restrict the sale of the most polluting scootersâie, those with a two-stroke engine type. At the same time, new electric scooters (e-scooters) could help reduce the burden of air pollution. From summer, 2017, the citizens of Amsterdam, Netherlands, will be able to benefit from a shared e-scooter initiative, following San Francisco, Paris, and Barcelona. At first sight, the absolute impact of introduction of e-scooters in the so-called bicycle capital of the world might be considered moderate given the relative low number of scooters compared with regular bicycle users. However, these regular cyclists have relatively high air pollution exposure due to their elevated respiratory minute volume combined with the short distance between scooters and cyclists on Dutch bicycle lanes. On a more global scale, and taking into account the popularity of two-stroke scooters and less stringent regulations in regions such as Asia and Africa, the expected health effects of e-scooter introduction are substantial.6The LancetUK air pollution and public health.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1860Scopus (7) Google Scholar In Vietnam's capital city Hanoi, steep economic development and fast urbanisation have been associated with a rapid increase in the vehicle fleet, with an annual growth of about 15% in the number of motorcycles. Traffic contributes largely to the air pollution in the city, and accounts for about 70% of the total pollution, with profound peaks during the morning and afternoon rush hours. Calculation of the health risks caused by traffic shows that daily commuting in Hanoi causes a substantial health burden. In 2009, traffic exhaust caused more than 3000 deaths.7Hieu VV Quynh LX Ho PH Hens L Health risk assessment of mobility-related air pollution in Ha Noi, Vietnam.J Environ Protect. 2013; 4: 1165-1172Crossref Google Scholar In addition, the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in non-smoking inhabitants of urban Vietnam is more than 10% which seems, next to indoor air pollution, to be partly as a result of heavy traffic air pollution.8Nguyen Viet N Yunus F Nguyen Thi Phuong A et al.The prevalence and patient characteristics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in non-smokers in Vietnam and Indonesia: an observational survey.Respirology. 2015; 20: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar Therefore, Vietnam has launched the Vietnam-Integrated Action Plan to Reduce Vehicle Emission,9Asian Development BankVietnam-Integrated Action Plan to Reduce Vehicle Emissions.http://en.openei.org/wiki/Vietnam-Integrated_Action_Plan_to_Reduce_Vehicle_EmissionsGoogle Scholar with its main goal to reduce mobile sources of air pollution in Vietnam's largest cities. Specific subgoals include the facilitation of use of alternative fuels, environmentally friendly vehicles, and implementation of energy efficiency measures in the transport sector. E-scooters are considered one of the promising solutions for this Action plan and offer an acceptable alternative for urban citizens having to travel daily distances of 20â25 km with frequent traffic jams during which they are exposed to pollution for several hours. Strict scooter emission regulations and the stimulation of e-scooters could also have striking effects elsewhere in the Asian region. In Guangzhou (China), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene concentration levels dropped from 228 Î¼g/m3 to 37 Î¼g/m3 after a total ban of scooters from the inner city in 2005.5Platt SM Haddad IE Pieber SM et al.Two-stroke scooters are a dominant source of air pollution in many cities.Nature Commun. 2014; 5: 3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar The same may hold true for Africa. For example, in Kampala (Uganda), a city where 300 000 scooters called boda bodas operate (figure), dangerously high concentrations of air pollutants have been reported.10Kirenga BJ Meng Q van Gemert F et al.The state of ambient air quality in two Ugandan cities: a pilot cross-sectional spatial assessment.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2015; 12: 8075-8091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar Replacement of two-stroke scooters with e-scooters would greatly reduce air pollution here too. The technology is available and it may seem time for large scale adoption. Yet several challenges have to be overcome. The comparatively high price of e-scooters might necessitate government subsidies, safety will remain an issue (in Shanghai and Beijing, scooters were banned from public roads in summer, 2016, for safety reasons), and battery life may be problematic so sufficient charging points will be needed, as well as parking places. In conclusion, e-scooters seem to offer a promising solution in the battle against air pollution, sustainable energy use and healthy living environments. Implementation generally takes several years however, and traditional polluting scooters do still largely outnumber their e-variants. Will the battery eventually win the battle?

    "ab": "The 2011 Great East Earthquake and consequent tsunami that hit Japan was an event in a high-income country with considerable capacity to handle disaster. But the involvement of the nuclear power station positioned for cooling on the coast made it that much worse. The immediate disaster was clear globally, and has been followed by national and international analysis of acute responses for each type of event (earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear power station failure), including population health protection and societal responses for the aftermath of destruction of infrastructure, deaths, health impacts, and displacements. This is challenging and costly for any individual nation. Going further and assessing long-term impact is even less straightforward. How do we really know what the effects on populations of disaster, whether man-made or natural, will be, or the increasing likelihood of the two intimately entangled? These will be short, medium, and long term and will be influenced by many factors, including wealth of nations, culture, social capital, coherence, and investment in infrastructure before and after. Earlier research from other disasters has suggested that disruption to the living environment and social environment can be followed by major long-term distress. Rarely though is there the opportunity to examine individuals across the time of a disaster and to examine carefully potential mitigating as well as exacerbating influences. The study published here by Hiroyuki Hikichi and colleagues1Hikichi H Tsuboya T Aida J et al.Social capital and cognitive decline in the aftermath of a natural disaster: a quasi-experiment from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e105-e113Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar in The Lancet Planetary Health uses the opportunity provided by the existence of a routine health survey within Japan, which is done at regular intervals and collected wider data too, to undertake a before and after analysis of key factors that could be affected by the consequences of the disaster, but also those factors that might mitigate negative outcomes. This builds on an earlier analysis, which suggests that there is some, limited, cognitive deterioration related to housing damage in those re-interviewed at 2 and a half years after the event. In the analysis presented here, social capital is explored using the existing data marshaled into factors with a cognitive dimension and a structural dimension. These are characterised as perceptions of community cohesion and informal socialising and social participation, respectively. These factors showed that the second concept, not the first, mitigated the impact of housing damage on incidence of cognitive impairment. There are potential caveats and limitations to this work, which include the availability of data for individuals before and after, the particular area chosen, the exact measures which have been taken to measure mitigating and exacerbating factors, as well as the outcome measurement of cognition. But the finding is robust and no other study can be put in place to provide better data. This type of research is to be welcomed. It is important that we understand better how societies do mitigate adverse outcomes following adverse events. These have happened to Homo sapiens and our forebears since time immemorial, and are part of our evolution as a species. However, it seems likely that with the pressures on global resources, increasing societal uncertainty and conflicts, increasing life expectancy, and the way that man-made influences such as climate change are coming together over this decade and those to come will increase in frequency. There is an important research agenda, which has been noted for post conflict societies, including generational populations living as refugees, as having profound impact on children and potentially their whole lives. In addition to this enormously important attention, we need to pay attention to how we, as whole societies, best mitigate the disasters that will come, and how this mitigation relates to contextual and cultural factors. The research that is needed includes transdisciplinary work, capacity investment, and the kinds of background investment that has allowed Japan to inform the world on the impact of a particular type of disaster. Such a strengthening of our capacity and the discussions that lead to this and are informed by such new capacity should have wider global benefits. Our disaster planning should be better and perhaps it will also help, through evidence, to shift our politicians and wider systems to address the upstream issues to work collectively and more effectively to anticipate those events that could be mitigated and, indeed, avoidable. I declare no competing interests. Social capital and cognitive decline in the aftermath of a natural disaster: a natural experiment from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and TsunamiImproved informal socialising and social participation reduces the risk of cognitive decline due to housing damage in the aftermath of natural disasters. Interventions to promote civic participation should be tried to promote cognitive resilience of older survivors. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "Plasmodium knowlesi is principally a primate malaria parasite that affects long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, transmitted by the exophagic Anopheles leucosphyrus group. Robert Knowles and Das Gupta provided the first extensive description of the parasite, including the ability of this primate malaria to infect humans in 1932. Soon after, P knowelsi was used to infect patients with neurosyphilis to ameliorate symptoms in the pre-antibiotic era, but clinicians soon stopped using it when it became too pathogenic. In recent years P knowlesi has emerged as an important human pathogen and now poses a substantial challenge to malaria elimination in the Asia Pacific Region. This is especially the case in Malaysia, where P knowelsi has become the predominant cause of human malaria, but is also likely to impact on elimination efforts in Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar. This threat to elimination is largely due to the large parasite reservoir that infected macaques provide for ongoing transmission and the challenges that this poses in the prevention of sporadic human infection. Accurately quantifying this risk has been challenging for various reasons. Among these is the lack of adequate diagnostics. The light microscopy appearance of P knowlesi is indistinguishable from Plasmodium malariae and is frequently confused with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. There are no P knowlesi-specific antigen detection rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and those with pan-malaria antigen detection suffer from low sensitivity, low specificity, and cross-reactivity with other Plasmodium species.1Grigg MJ William T Barber BE et al.Combining parasite lactate dehydrogenase-based and histidine-rich protein 2-based rapid tests to improve specificity for diagnosis of malaria due to Plasmodium knowlesi and other Plasmodium species in Sabah, Malaysia.J Clin Microbiol. 2014; 52: 2053-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar Indeed, PCR remains the most reliable way to diagnose P knowlesi malaria with high sensitivity and specificity, although there are reports of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) being used.2Britton S Cheng Q Grigg MJ William T Anstey NM McCarthy JS A sensitive, colorimetric, high-throughput loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of Plasmodium knowlesi.Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2016; 95: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar Poor diagnostics partly contribute to inadequate surveillance for P knowlesi infection and calls have been made to include specific P knowlesi reporting to WHO to encourage improved regional surveillance.3Barber BE Rajahram GS Grigg MJ William T Anstey NM World Malaria Report: time to acknowledge Plasmodium knowlesi malaria.Malar J. 2017; 16: 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar Perhaps the greatest challenge however, relates to the epidemiology of this disease and understanding the interactions that occur between the reservoir hosts (ie, monkeys), vectors, and human activities that enable transmission. Understanding these complex behavioral and ecological interactions will provide insights into how this disease is evolving from a forest-located entity, to one that is found at the forest fringe and is moving into peri-urban areas.4Brock PM Fornace KM Parmiter M et al.Plasmodium knowlesi transmission: integrating quantitative approaches from epidemiology and ecology to understand malaria as a zoonosis.Parasitology. 2016; 143: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar Within these interactions is the need to examine specific risk factors that drive disease transmission to humans. Such details are crucial to identify those most at risk and to implement appropriate prevention strategies. In The Lancet Planetary Health, Matthew Grigg and colleagues provide important insights into human activities that affect the risk of P knowlesi infection.5Grigg MJ Cox J William T et al.Individual-level factors associated with the risk of acquiring human Plasmodium knowlesi malaria in Malaysia: a case-control study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e97-104Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar This case-control study of P knowlesi infection was done in Sabah, Malaysia, which has had the highest recorded rates of P knowlesi infection globally. The study recruited 229 cases with P knowlesi infection over a 2 year period and 91 cases with infection due to other Plasmodium species. This study is the first published work of its kind and seeks to quantify the risk of infection for a wide range of potential risk factors, including demographics, medical history, work or school activities, sleeping or bathing patterns, travel activities, malaria prevention measures, travel history, interactions with monkeys, and features of the residences of participants. This study design and the wide range of risk factors assessed is a strength of this work and affords helpful insights into the risks most strongly associated with clinical episodes of P knowlesi. There are several findings from this study that are especially noteworthy. First, the study finds significant heterogeneity in co-transmission of P knowlesi and other Plasmodium species. The investigators found that P knowlesi infection was present widely throughout both districts of Kota Marudu and Kudat, whereas other Plasmodium species (ie, non-P knowlesi species) were largely confined to inland areas of Kota Marudu, with few cases on Kudat. This distribution suggests that current strategies are successfully targeting non-P knowlesi species and that residual cases are largely confined to remote regions, possibly those with lower coverage of control interventions. Grigg and colleagues also show that these strategies are having less impact on P knowlesi infections and that specific interventions need to be identified for successful P knowlesi elimination. It is important to note that the study design accounted for this geographic heterogeneity with regionally matched controls, enabling an assessment of specific risk factors. Second, the authors successfully identify several features of individuals with high-risk for P knowlesi disease. This includes a strong risk bias towards individuals over the age of 15 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4Â·16, 95% CI 2Â·09â8Â·29) and a strong bias towards men, who made up 76% (174 of 229 cases) of P knowlesi cases. Notably, the results showed that infection with other Plasmodium species was largely confined to individuals younger than 15 years but that men were also at higher risk. Similar findings were identified among the 19 P knowlesi cases and 1 subpatent infection described in a cross-sectional study in Indonesia.6Herdiana H Cotter C Coutrier FN et al.Malaria risk factor assessment using active and passive surveillance data from Aceh Besar, Indonesia, a low endemic, malaria elimination setting with Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium falciparum.Malar J. 2016; 15: 468Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar The study results also mirror gender-biased findings widely observed across southeast Asia for other Plasmodium species. These results show that interventions need to be strongly targeted towards men and that programmes centred on maternal and child health will be inadequate for malaria elimination, especially for P knowlesi. The observation that P knowlesi infection occurs in older individuals has several possible explanations that need further investigation. One possibility is that, in areas of co-transmission with other Plasmodium species, the acquisition of natural immunity to P falciparum and P vivax early in life, is not providing substantial protection against P knowlesi infection. Further investigation is required to understand cross-protective immunity between these species, and the maintenance of natural immunity and memory responses over many years. The observation of higher risk in older individuals might also relate to occupational risk. The study identifies farming and palm oil plantation work as particularly high-risk occupations. Despite being quite different jobs, it is likely that there are many other shared risk factors, but these are not clearly disentangled in this study. A further subgroup analysis would be informative. Notably, the prevalence of G6PD deficiency was very low among cases compared with controls, and this was especially so for P knowlesi infections compared with other Plasmodium species. Significant uncertainty remains about the precise vectors, the plasticity of vector host-selection (ie, monkey vs human) and the exact location of vector exposure that results in human transmission of P knowlesi, especially across different parts of Asia.7Manin BO Ferguson HM Vythilingam I et al.Investigating the contribution of peri-domestic transmission to risk of zoonotic malaria infection in humans.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016; 10: e0005064Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Yakob L Lloyd AL Kao RR et al.Plasmodium knowlesi invasion following spread by infected mosquitoes, macaques and humans.Parasitology. 2017; (published online March 27)https://doi.org/10.1017/S0031182016002456Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar In particular, uncertainty exists as to whether transmission is occurring predominately in the forest, farms at the forest-fringe, or villages, and the degree of transmission that is peri-domestic or domestic. Grigg and colleagues noted that having long grass around the house, and having open eaves or gaps in walls are associated with increased risk of P knowlesi. Similarly the use of indoor residual spraying, which was only implemented in 94 (41%) of the 229 cases, was associated with a significant reduction in risk. They also found that the use of bednets by 177 (78%) cases, seemed to have only a marginal effect on risk. These findings are generally supportive of those of Manin and colleagues7Manin BO Ferguson HM Vythilingam I et al.Investigating the contribution of peri-domestic transmission to risk of zoonotic malaria infection in humans.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016; 10: e0005064Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar who identified peri-domestic transmission as being a more greater problem than domestic transmission. Together these studies show that greater benefits might result from improving housing and cutting back peri-domestic vegetation than from intensifying indoor residual spraying and bednet distribution. Wong and colleagues9Wong ML Chua TH Leong CS et al.Seasonal and spatial dynamics of the primary vector of Plasmodium knowlesi within a major transmission focus in Sabah, Malaysia.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015; 9: e0004135Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar have described higher densities of Anopheles balabacensis in villages than in farming areas and forests, but that mosquito longevity, which is crucial for Plasmodium development, was higher in farming areas and forests. Brant and colleagues10Brant HL Ewers RM Vythilingam I Drakeley C Benedick S Mumford JD Vertical stratification of adult mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) within a tropical rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia.Malar J. 2016; 15: 370Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar have also described a preference of A balabacensis to bite humans at ground level rather than high in the forest canopy. Thus, the likelihood that the main place of transmission occurs outdoors at ground level in forested areas was strongly supported by the findings of Grigg and colleagues, who showed that recent clearing of vegetation was a high-risk activity, as was sleeping outside the house, even though this was relatively infrequent; only 33 (15%) of cases. Recent awareness of the presence of monkeys was also a strong predictor of risk, further suggesting a high likelihood of monkey-to-human transmission as the predominant transmission pathway, rather than human-to-human transmission. This study by Grigg and colleagues provides quantifiable risk estimates for a wide range of variables relevant to the transmission of P knowlesi to humans. There are now a series of studies shedding light on the transmission dynamics of P knowlesi in Sabah, but further research is needed in this area and in other parts of southeast Asia where humans live in the forest or on the forest fringe, sharing their habitat with P knowlesi-infected macaques and their Anopheline vectors. In particular, further research is needed to better understand the ecological interactions that place people at risk of P knowlesi and the measures that can be implemented to minimise these risks. This will also be greatly aided by improving diagnostics and surveillance for this infection so that hot spots of transmission can be rapidly and precisely identified. We declare no competing interests. Individual-level factors associated with the risk of acquiring human Plasmodium knowlesi malaria in Malaysia: a case-control studyAdult men working in agricultural areas were at highest risk of knowlesi malaria, although peri-domestic transmission also occurrs. Human behavioural factors associated with P knowlesi transmission could be targeted in future public health interventions. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

    "ab": "Waterâthe main component of Earth's ecosystemsâconcentrates some of the most worrying global concerns that have emerged during the Anthropocene.1Hamilton C Define the Anthropocene in terms of the whole Earth.Nature. 2016; 536: 251Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar When it comes to health considered at a planetary level, the challenges related to water can be sorted into five main categories: pollution, access to water, wastewaters, loss of biodiversity, and emergence of superbugs.2Seddon N Mace GM Naeem S et al.Biodiversity in the anthropocene: prospects and policy.Proc Biol Sci. 2016; 283: 1844Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Broszat M Nacke H Blasi R et al.Wastewater irrigation increases the abundance of potentially harmful gammaproteobacteria in soils in Mezquital Valley, Mexico.Appl Environ Microbiol. 2014; 80: 5282-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Mekonnen MM Hoekstra AY Four billion people facing severe water scarcity.Sci Adv. 2016; 2: e1500323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar Important efforts are already being made by the international community to preserve water environments and resources globally, such as the recent creation of vast protected marine areas in the Antarctic Ocean. Pursuing these efforts is essential, but a massive behavioural shift is necessary to reverse some of the alterations that human actions have already induced, and to maintain global health at a sustainable level on a planetary scale. However, and although the general state surrounding water keep degrading, threatening health at a global level, most of the population remains hermetic to the behavioural changes that the situation would require. Now is the right time to try alternative paths to surmount these obstacles, and to involve the populations more intimately with the adaptations needed. A first factor that could account for the resistance to change of the population is that the different challenges related to water tend to be considered to be independent and parallel problems. They are, however, interconnected in a dreadful network (figure). Linking these issuesâand their consequences on global healthâstronger and more obviously might help to push further the involvement of the population. In an increasingly urbanised world, the need to reinforce healthy relationships between human beings and their environment is strong. Reshaping direct interactions between human beings and water could increase awareness of challenges and questions related to water. Of note, although this could be done at a group level by reintegrating water in urban landscapes, actions as simple as increasing opportunities to swim could have surprising effects at the individual level.5Foley R Kistemann T Blue space geographies: enabling health in place.Health Place. 2015; 35: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar However, drastic and large-scale behavioural shifts will not come from that alone. The difficulties in triggering these changes are not just contextualâie, related to the design of our living spaces. They are also the consequence of a problem of communication channel. Indeed, most of the solutions proposed so far are imposed by governments to the populations. An important step to get this behavioural shift wholeheartedly accepted by the world population is to move from top-down to bottom-up strategies, so that people can be the main actors of their own changes. Although the motivation to trigger these choices might come from a more integrated understanding, which will arise from assembling the different major water challenges into a single and unified framework, the societal propagation of these behavioural changes will require appropriate channels. The digital era has provided us with a plethora of new instruments allowing us to reach large populations with an unprecedented efficiency. Internet-based virtual communities might well be the key to massively unlock global awareness. As a matter of fact, the potential of health-related virtual communities is being closely scrutinised, and eHealth interventions are becoming more commonly involved with virtual communities as a part of their strategy to optimally reach their target population. This growing interest could fruitfully extend to cyber environmentalism. Indeed, water-related virtual communities already exist, and are quite active. For instance, the merfolk virtual community occupies various virtual spaces ranging from social media to 3D immersive virtual worlds, forming a unique yet vivid and heavily interconnected ecosystem.6Guitton MJ From fantasy, to virtual spaces, to reality, and back: Structuring the merfolk community.in: Guitton MJ Fan Phenomena: Mermaids. Intellect, Bristol2016: 64-73Google Scholar Numerous other virtual communities, based on local (eg, citizens of specific coastal areas) or global interests (eg, surfers or fans of other water sports) share this attraction to water-related topics. While the potential of these virtual communities is still untapped when it comes to global health, they could act as a so-called Trojan Horse by being a vector to trigger, promote, and support behavioural changes in the population. Because most of the problematic human actions are related to our consumer habits, involving systematically virtual communities would not only contribute to change in a positive way the popular representations associated with water, but also to shape new behavioural patternsânotably, by forcing brands to further ecofriendly messages and attitudes to make their (e)marketing strategies successful. Having virtual communities coordinate their actions toward sustainable objectives might represent a help that should not be underestimated. To avoid large-scale public health effects, facing the water challenges will be crucial in the near future. As the problems become further globalised, so have to be our responses. Holistic approaches in the 21st century will have to integrate fundamental humanist values with the new and emerging information technologies. In view of the emergency of the situation, new strategies should be implemented quickly to simultaneously address several of these challenges, or else we risk jeopardising our future.

    "ab": "Mycobacterium ulcerans is a bacterial infection causing necrotising lesions of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Widely known as Buruli ulcer, it is classified as a neglected tropical disease by WHO. If diagnosed and treated early, outcomes are good,1Friedman ND Athan E Walton AL O'Brien DP Increasing experience with primary oral medical therapy for Mycobacterium ulcerans disease in an Australian cohort.Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2016; 60: 2692-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar but if left untreated it can progress to a severe disease resulting in high levels of morbidity and permanent disability.2Vincent QB Ardant MF Adeye A et al.Clinical epidemiology of laboratory-confirmed Buruli ulcer in Benin: a cohort study.Lancet Glob Health. 2014; 2: e422-e430Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar Occurring in 33 countries worldwide, the largest burden of disease is found in children living in rural and resource-limited areas of central and western Africa where limited access to health care and community beliefs and stigmaâin Ghana, witchcraft and curses are among the explanations for this diseaseâlead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, with devastating outcomes.3Stienstra Y van der Graaf WT Asamoa K van der Werf TS Beliefs and attitudes toward Buruli Ucer in Ghana.Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2002; 67: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar As a result, since its first description in Australia in 1948,4MacCallum P Tolhurst JC Buckle G et al.A new mycobacterial infection in man.J pathol bacteriol. 1948; 60: 93-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar affected communities, clinicians, and researchers have been searching for ways to prevent this disease. This search has been thwarted by the fact that the exact environmental reservoir and method of transmission have not been established. Prevailing opinion is that human beings are infected from the environment: in endemic regions, the disease is highly focal and usually associated with wetlands or coastal regions,5Williamson HR Benbow ME Nguyen KD et al.Distribution of Mycobacterium ulcerans in Buruli ulcer endemic and non-endemic aquatic sites in Ghana.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2008; 2: e205Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar and PCR testing of environmental samples, such as water, aquatic plants, soil, and detritus from swamps, can find evidence of the organism.6Fyfe JA Lavender CJ Handasyde KA et al.A major role for mammals in the ecology of Mycobacterium ulcerans.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2010; 4: e791Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Vandelannoote K Durnez L Amissah D et al.Application of real-time PCR in Ghana, a Buruli ulcer-endemic country, confirms the presence of Mycobacterium ulcerans in the environment.FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2010; 304: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Johnson PD Azuolas J Lavender CJ et al.Mycobacterium ulcerans in mosquitoes captured during outbreak of Buruli ulcer, southeastern Australia.Emerg Infect Dis. 2007; 13: 1653-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar Insects such as mosquitoes7Vandelannoote K Durnez L Amissah D et al.Application of real-time PCR in Ghana, a Buruli ulcer-endemic country, confirms the presence of Mycobacterium ulcerans in the environment.FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2010; 304: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and water-residing biting arthropods9Marsollier L Robert R Aubry J et al.Aquatic insects as a vector for Mycobacterium ulcerans.Appl Environ Microbiol. 2002; 68: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar have been associated with M ulcerans epidemiologically and via PCR testing and therefore proposed as vectors for transmission. In Victoria, Australia, evidence suggests that native possums might be involved in transmission.6Fyfe JA Lavender CJ Handasyde KA et al.A major role for mammals in the ecology of Mycobacterium ulcerans.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2010; 4: e791Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar The Article in The Lancet Planetary Health by Maylis Douine and colleagues10Douine M Gozlan R Nacher M et al.Mycobacterium ulcerans infection (Buruli ulcer) in French Guiana, South America, 1969â2013: an epidemiological study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e65-e73Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar provides an important epidemiological and clinical description of M ulcerans infection diagnosed and managed in French Guiana from 1969 to 2013. The great strength of the study is the long time period over which cases have been prospectively followedâto my knowledge, the longest known longitudinal recording of cases worldwide. It covers a period of substantial population expansion and increasing wealth. The long time period of this study represents a unique opportunity to study disease epidemiology over time and could provide insights into the environmental reservoirs and disease transmission in both this region and globally. Some of the study observations are worth highlighting. First, as described in many African regions, the number of cases reported yearly has decreased, from 6Â·07 infections per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 4Â·46â7Â·67) in 1969â83 to 3Â·49 infections per 100 000 person-years (2Â·83â4Â·16) in 1999â2013. Reasons are unknown, but perhaps relate to changing environmental conditions in the era of climate change, the change in population dynamics and land use, or possibly some success with prevention methods such as mosquito net use. Some have even speculated that increasing antibiotic use against M ulcerans could be responsible if human beings represent the disease reservoir, although the situation in Victoria, Australia, where antibiotic treatment is widely used and cases of disease are rapidly increasing,11Victoria State GovernmentSurveillance of notifiable conditions in Victoria.https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/infectious-diseases/infectious-diseases-surveillance/search-infectious-diseases-data/victorian-summaryGoogle Scholar argues against this explanation. An alternative explanation could be improvements in the accuracy of diagnosis. For example, in the study of Douine and colleagues, an increased proportion of cases were classified as suspected in the early period (1969â98) before PCR confirmation testing for M Ulcerans became available in the year 2000.12Ross BC Marino L Oppedisano F Edwards R Robins-Browne RM Johnson PD Development of a PCR assay for rapid diagnosis of Mycobacterium ulcerans infection.J Clin Microbiol. 1997; 35: 1696-1700PubMed Google Scholar Thus, the reduced incidence worldwide13WHOBuruli ulcer. Situation and trends.http://www.who.int/gho/neglected_diseases/buruli_ulcer/en/Google Scholar could reflect the increased accuracy of diagnosis since PCR confirmation was introduced. Second, despite an increasing proportion of children in the general population, a decrease was found in the incidence and proportion of cases diagnosed in children over the study period. Once again, the reasons are unclear, but the authors have postulated that this decrease could reflect improved living conditions and hygiene, presumably related to improved population wealth or possibly a change in clothing or children's activities. Alternatively, as the periods in which most cases in children were reported coincided with a much higher proportion of non PCR-confirmed cases, overdiagnosis of disease could be responsible. Third, sex differences were noted with respect to location of lesions, with men more often affected on the chest and upper limbs than women and women more likely to be affected on the lower limbs than men. Sex differences in disease presentation have also been noted in Africa2Vincent QB Ardant MF Adeye A et al.Clinical epidemiology of laboratory-confirmed Buruli ulcer in Benin: a cohort study.Lancet Glob Health. 2014; 2: e422-e430Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and Australia.14Boyd SC Athan E Friedman ND et al.Epidemiology, clinical features and diagnosis of Mycobacterium ulcerans in an Australian population.Med J Aust. 2012; 196: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar These differences provide some clues about disease transmissionâfor example, they might argue against insect vectors, whose biting patterns are unlikely to be sex specific (unless the disease patterns represent differences in use of protective clothing, bed nets, or sleeping patterns), but perhaps point to trauma as a method of infection, as body areas prone to trauma might differ by gender. Finally, various observations were similar to those from other world regions, suggesting a common link between world regions in environmental reservoirs and disease transmission. These observations include the fact that cases were limited to coastal regions, the number of cases varied from year to year and region to region, and the number of cases was sex balanced.2Vincent QB Ardant MF Adeye A et al.Clinical epidemiology of laboratory-confirmed Buruli ulcer in Benin: a cohort study.Lancet Glob Health. 2014; 2: e422-e430Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Boyd SC Athan E Friedman ND et al.Epidemiology, clinical features and diagnosis of Mycobacterium ulcerans in an Australian population.Med J Aust. 2012; 196: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar No information was provided on seasonality of disease presentationâobservations that have been noted elsewhere.14Boyd SC Athan E Friedman ND et al.Epidemiology, clinical features and diagnosis of Mycobacterium ulcerans in an Australian population.Med J Aust. 2012; 196: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Landier J Constantin de Magny G Garchitorena A Texier G Seasonal patterns of Buruli ulcer incidence, central Africa, 2002â2012.Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21: 1414-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar This study raises many interesting questions about M ulcerans disease epidemiology, which require intensive research into factors such as climate, local flora and fauna, and population characteristics, building on the clues from this and other studies. Answers to these and other questions are urgently required16O'Brien DP Comte E Serafini M et al.The urgent need for clinical, diagnostic, and operational research for management of Buruli ulcer in Africa.Lancet Infect Dis. 2014; 14: 435-440Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar as the world desperately requires concrete public health interventions based on solid evidence to truly hope that we can consign the devastating health consequences of this infection to history.

World Health Organization, Geneva2016Google Scholar Climate services for health is an emerging discipline with an objective to help health professionals better understand the effect of climate and weather conditions on health, and ultimately, to anticipate disease risk consequent upon climate change. Eventually, this holistic process will enable targeting of interventions for more efficient and effective prevention and treatment to reduce risk of disease transmission. In The Lancet Planetary Health, Rachel Lowe and colleagues7Lowe R Stewart Ibarra AM Petrova D et al.Climate services for health: predicting the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in Machala, Ecuador.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e142-e152Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar show the potential of application of climate services for health to dengue in the city of Machala, El Oro Province, Ecuador, where dengue is hyperendemic and transmitted throughout the year with co-circulation of all four dengue serotypes. Machala is an ideal site for analysis of dengue transmission mechanisms, in view of the high vector indices and volume of people and goods moving across the EcuadorâPeru border.8Stewart-Ibarra AM Munoz AG Ryan SJ et al.Spatiotemporal clustering, climate periodicity, and social-ecological risk factors for dengue during an outbreak in Machala, Ecuador, in 2010.BMC Infect Dis. 2014; 14: 610Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar Monthly dengue incidence was predicted from January to November, 2016, using a seasonal climate forecast of precipitation and minimum temperature and El NiÃ±o forecast in a Bayesian statistical model framework. The estimated dengue incidence was then compared with active surveillance data. The collation of spatiotemporal climatic data with epidemiological, clinical, and environmental data is a powerful approach to understanding associations between health outcome and climate exposure. Although climate data has been used to formulate disease models and produce predictions, Lowe and her colleagues7Lowe R Stewart Ibarra AM Petrova D et al.Climate services for health: predicting the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in Machala, Ecuador.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e142-e152Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar present the first study to use active surveillance data to account for misreporting of other diseases (chikungunya in this study) as dengue to improve the model. The great strengths of the study are the use of real-time climate forecasts to make long-lead dengue predictions and the use of active surveillance data. The practical benefit is the demonstration that the use of seasonal climate and El NiÃ±o forecasts allows a prediction to be made at the start of the year for the entire dengue season. While the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health, which is the institution responsible for dengue control,9Heydari N Larsen AD Neira M et al.Household dengue prevention interventions, expenditures, and barriers to Aedes aegypti control in Machala, Ecuador.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2017; 14: 2Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar informally monitors dengue incidence based on historical passive surveillance data averaged over the previous 5 years, Lowe and colleagues7Lowe R Stewart Ibarra AM Petrova D et al.Climate services for health: predicting the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in Machala, Ecuador.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e142-e152Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar provide a method for advanced warning of the timing and magnitude of peak dengue incidence. This work confirms that the health community in Ecuador needs climate services to anticipate dengue transmission. The predictions by Lowe and colleagues,7Lowe R Stewart Ibarra AM Petrova D et al.Climate services for health: predicting the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in Machala, Ecuador.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e142-e152Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar if reproducible, represent an opportunity for the authorities to (1) increase resources for health surveillance, vector control, and prevention (eg, seasonal increase in personnel, community participation, sustainable access to piped water), (2) improve the diagnosis of clinical cases and laboratory confirmation of cases to avoid misreporting, and (3) increase reporting speed. Understanding how climate variability and long-term climate change affect transmission of dengue and other vector-borne diseases is an ongoing challenge. Climate services synthesise input from multiple disciplines and hence encourage innovative thinking to reduce uncertainty in projections. Lowe and colleagues7Lowe R Stewart Ibarra AM Petrova D et al.Climate services for health: predicting the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in Machala, Ecuador.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e142-e152Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar present a case study, showing a way forward for the discipline of climate services. They contend that seasonal climate forecasting is more accurate during El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a events. However, how real-time climate forecasts would perform in the absence of a long El NiÃ±o season remains unclear. In some years, other factors will have a more powerful effect on dengue incidence than seasonal climate factors (eg, efficiency of vector control programmes, population immunity status, patterns of human settlement, movement from neighbouring endemic regions, population growth and density, socioeconomic factors, absence of community engagement, budget cuts in health).10Viennet E Ritchie SA Williams CR Faddy HM Harley D Public health responses to and challenges for the control of dengue transmission in high-income countries: four case studies.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016; 10: e0004943Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar Such information, nevertheless, is challenging to obtain with a sufficient degree of quality, reliability, suitability, and at the appropriate spatiotemporal scale, especially in resource-limited settings. The aforementioned factors are not accounted for in the model, but including yearly random effects is a suitable way to quantify interannual variability in dengue risk resulting from unmeasured factors. Further work using improved seasonal climate forecasts is needed to confirm the potential value of incorporating climate information into health decision instruments. These methods must be generalised and translated into a public health decision-making instrument for health authorities to reduce the burden of climate-sensitive diseases, and to work to optimise quality and quantity of spatiotemporal data to deliver the best possible early warning systems for climate-affected diseases.

Climate services for health: predicting the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in Machala, EcuadorThis dengue prediction framework, which uses seasonal climate and El NiÃ±o forecasts, allows a prediction to be made at the start of the year for the entire dengue season. Combining active surveillance data with routine dengue reports improved not only model fit and performance, but also the accuracy of benchmark estimates based on historical seasonal averages. This study advances the state-of-the-art of climate services for the health sector, by showing the potential value of incorporating climate information in the public health decision-making process in Ecuador.

    "ab": "Losses throughout the food system increase demands on agriculture, with consequent environmental impacts. A less wasteful and more efficient food system is a desirable goal, but what constitutes a loss and the relative magnitude of different types of loss are less clear. Research and policy related to food waste typically imply that the food system boundary extends to the point at which food is eaten.1FAODo goodâsave food! Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy2017Google Scholar, 2Gustavsson J Cederberg C Sonesson U van Otterdijk R Meybeck A Global food losses and food wast textent, causes and prevention. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy2011Google Scholar But if the objective of the food system is to provide sufficient healthy and nutritious food in a sustainable manner, then consumption in excess of nutritional requirements is also a form of food waste; the latter defined as the loss occurring from retailers' and consumers' behaviours.2Gustavsson J Cederberg C Sonesson U van Otterdijk R Meybeck A Global food losses and food wast textent, causes and prevention. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy2011Google Scholar We suggest that the current food waste agenda and rhetoric warrants re-examination because overconsumption of food is more damaging to society than discarded food waste due to a combination of environmental and health costs. A last-portion dilemma can be posited, in which too much food is prepared for a meal and a proportion remains after the eaters are comfortably full. What are the issues that determine the socially responsible action, and what do they suggest about treating overconsumption as a loss? The desire to reduce waste seems to imply a duty for the diners to consume the remaining food. Other private and social behavioural motives might reinforce this action, such as a form of moral satisfaction from perceived waste reduction,3Kahneman D Knetsch JL Valuing public-goodâthe purchase of moral satisfaction.J Environ Econ Managet. 1992; 22: 57-70Crossref Scopus (1192) Google Scholar and discounting the long-term implications from being overweight.4Green L Myerson J A discounting framework for choice with delayed and probabilistic rewards.Psychol Bulln. 2004; 130: 769-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar Such small individual acts across a large population would materially reduce discarded food, and if total demand remains constant, would be reflected in lower agricultural production. Consequently, less land, water, fertiliser, and agrichemicals would be used in agriculture, with benefits in terms of lower greenhouse gas emissions, as well as water and biodiversity conservation. But consider the alternative outcomes of so-called virtuous plate-clearing. If the additional portion does not displace other consumptionâie, the amount eaten subsequently is not reducedâthen total consumption will have increased. A lack of displacement means no reduction in demand for agricultural commodities and no environmental benefits. If nutritional needs were already being met, increased bodyweight could result with associated health implications (eg, heart diseases and diabetes). Although additional food intake should be regulated by body homoeostasis; as a society we appear increasingly unable to control our weight, with an eighth of the global population being obese in 2014, treble the rate in 1975.5Di Cesare M Bentham J Stevens GA et al.Trends in adult body-mass index in 200 countries from 1975 to 2014: a pooled analysis of 1698 population-based measurement studies with 1Â·2 million participants.Lancet. 2016; 387: 1377-1396Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3079) Google Scholar Sedentary lifestyles, processed foods,6Hu FB Globalization of diabetes: the role of diet, lifestyle, and genes.Diabetes Care. 2011; 34: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar and larger portion sizes are all implicated in this trend, imposing increasing costs on health services. For example, 13% (Â£16 billion) of the UK's health budget in 2014 was spent on medical costs associated with diabetes and conditions related to being overweight or obese.7Dobbs R Sawers C Thompson F et al.Overcoming obesity: an initial economic assessment. A discussion paper by the McKinsey Global Institute.http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcaresystems-and-services/our-insights/how-the-world-could-better-fightobesityDate: November, 2014Google Scholar Consumption of the last portion has merely shifted losses from discarded food to excess consumption, and the total quantity of food produced and associated environmental pressures remain unaltered. Evaluation of food system losses until the food is eaten would misleadingly imply a reduction in waste. Overconsumption needs to be considered a loss for an accurate understanding to be presented. Although the individual circumstances of waste generation will be more varied than they are in this hypothetical dilemma, the associated issues and consequences remain. Aggregate global losses from overconsumption are at least as large as those from discarded waste at present. The annual social cost of greenhouse gas emissions associated with production of discarded and overconsumed food is around US$200 billion, assuming a high cost of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions of $80 per tonne applied to 20% of the 11 gigatonnes of CO2e per year total agricultural and land use emissions.8Alexander P Brown C Arneth A Finnigan J Moran D Rounsevell MDA Losses, inefficiencies and waste in the global food system.Agric Systs. 2017; 153: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 9Smith P Bustamante M Ahammad H et al.Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU).in: Edenhofer OR Pichs-Madruga Y Sokona E Climate change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change.

Food discarded and overconsumed have equivalent environmental outcomes, but overconsumption also has negative health externalities, and therefore more damaging consequences overall. Because the losses due to overconsumption are as large as those from other food waste but create greater harm, the current policy focus1FAODo goodâsave food! Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy2017Google Scholar, 2Gustavsson J Cederberg C Sonesson U van Otterdijk R Meybeck A Global food losses and food wast textent, causes and prevention. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy2011Google Scholar on discarded food seems disproportionate. Research and policy attention is needed to achieve the healthâenvironment double dividend from reduction of overconsumption waste. Consumer behaviour can be economically rational but still lead to suboptimal system outcomes,4Green L Myerson J A discounting framework for choice with delayed and probabilistic rewards.Psychol Bulln. 2004; 130: 769-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar including both forms of food waste. Influencing of these behaviours and the underlying preferences implies additional nudges for consumersâeg, to reduce portion size and to make greater use of leftovers, requiring policy and food industry engagement. Ultimately the synergies between health and environmental outcomes could be advantageous, as tackling the health burden might be a more politically and individually attractive entry point, with co-benefits for climate and environmental goals.

This absence of understanding is partly because the heterogeneity in previous studies makes it hard to synthesise their results. Additionally, little research has been done into the integrated effects of various climate-related hazards. In The Lancet Planetary Health, Giovanni Forzieri and colleagues11Forzieri G Cescatti A e Silva FB Feyen L Increasing risk over time of weather-related hazards to the European population: a data-driven prognostic study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e200-e208Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar present the future effects of the seven most harmful weather-related extreme events in Europe due to climate change. These seven events are heatwaves, cold waves, droughts, wildfires, river and coastal floods, and windstorms. They estimated the occurrence and intensity of the seven disasters as well as demographic changes in Europe until the year 2100 under business-as-usual climate and socioeconomic scenarios. Human vulnerability to extreme weather was obtained from disaster databases. This study has two strengths. First, it presents a comprehensive assessment of climate change risks by estimating the human cost from the seven most harmful extreme weather events, whereas previous studies mostly focused on projecting only the temperature-attributable mortality. Additionally, because of the consistency in study design, such as target population, location, and projection periods for each disaster, the effects of the disasters can be compared fairly with each other. Such fair comparison cannot be achieved from previous studies because of their heterogeneity. This comparison allows valuable information to be obtained to guide how mitigation efforts should be prioritised and focused. Second, this study also considered demographic changes in the projection of future human costs. Although most previous projection studies estimated the population on the scale of a nation or city, the authors incorporated a 1 ha-scale population projection, which is based on the dynamics of population and land use. Such fine-scale processing enables accurate estimation of population change in coastal flood-prone areas or of increases in city dwellers due to urbanisation. Forzieri and colleagues found that, first, two-thirds of the European population are expected to be exposed to weather-related disasters due to climate change annually by the year 2100, and disaster-attributable deaths are expected to increase by roughly 50 times. For the increased weather-related death toll, population change accounts for 10%, whereas climate change accounts for the remaining 90%. Second, among the seven disasters, heatwaves are the most lethal, accounting for 99% of the total future disaster-related mortality. Mortalities due to heatwaves are expected to increase by 5400%, due to coastal floods by 3780%, due to wildfires by 138%, due to river floods by 54%, and due to windstorms by 20%, whereas mortality due to cold waves is projected to decrease by 98%. The effects of heatwaves will be augmented by urbanisation (18% increase in city dwellers in Europe by 2050) and urban heat island effects. Similarly, the effects of coastal flooding will be amplified by population growth in coastal flood-prone areas (14% more than total population growth). In consulting the results presented in this study, readers should be aware of its assumptions. The study assumed that human vulnerability at baseline remains constant throughout the study period. People are known to adapt and become less vulnerable than previously to extreme weather conditions because of advances in medical technology, air conditioning, and thermal insulation in houses. Therefore, the results could be overestimated. Additionally, this study assumed that the effects of single hazards are independent, ignoring the combined effects, if any, of multihazard events. Despite its assumptions and limitations, the findings of the study will be useful for policy makers and urban planners to slow down climate change and mitigate its effects. We declare no competing interests. Increasing risk over time of weather-related hazards to the European population: a data-driven prognostic studyGlobal warming could result in rapidly rising costs of weather-related hazards to human beings in Europe unless adequate adaptation measures are taken. Our results could aid in prioritisation of regional investments to address the unequal burden of effects on human beings of weather-related hazards and differences in adaptation capacities.

    "ab": "Exposure to environmental pollution remains a major source of hazard not only for our health but also for our planet. In 2012, WHO estimated that exposures to polluted soil, water, and air contributed to an estimated 8Â·9 million deaths worldwide. Of these deaths, 94% (8Â·4 million) were in low-and-middle-income countries. Different pollutants are linked in children to non-communicable diseases (such as asthma), cognitive disorders, and perinatal defects, and, among adults, to heart disease, stroke, and cancer. However, although environmental pollution is reaching disturbing proportions worldwide, it remains a neglected problem in national policies and on international development agendas. What drives pollution? What strategies can be taken to prevent and control pollution? Since the industrial revolution, urbanisation and industrialisation, together with economic development, have led to increases in energy consumption and waste production. Exposures to air pollution, toxic chemicals, and pesticides are the main forms of pollution today causing disease in high-income countries. In low-and-middle-income countries, household air pollution and contaminated drinking water are long-established forms of environmental contamination. WHO estimated that ambient air pollution caused 3Â·7 million deaths, and that unsafe water, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene caused 842 000 deaths. Hazardous waste sites and contamination of soil and abandoned mines have killed hundreds of thousands people each year. However, during the past decade, with the spread of Western lifestyles, and the increasing globalisation of the chemical manufacturing industry, toxic chemicals, highly hazardous pesticides, and chemical wastes that previously were found only in high-income settings have been rapidly penetrating in low-and-middle-income countries too. Exposure of millions of people to asbestos in China, south and southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, lead intoxication from lead-acid battery recycling, and exposure to mercury from gold extraction are only a few dramatic examples of the growing exposure to toxic chemicals. The recent European scandal in which eggs were contaminated with fipronil (an insecticide commonly used to kill lice in animals) and the discharge of plastic into the sea are further examples of how exposure to toxic substances can pose serious risks to our health for the sake of economic development. Additionally, diseases caused by pollution impose great economic costs on nations around the world. It has been estimated that the cost of pollution in the US alone in 2008 was an astonishing US$76Â·6 billion. Yet pollution is preventable. But when compared with the attention given, for example, to AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, environmental pollution receives far less attention at the national and international levels, making it hard to put policy interventions and prevention strategies into practice. One reason for the relative lack of action may be the difficulty in establishing causal associations between pollution and illness, together with the fact that various components of pollutionâsuch as air pollution, water pollution, asbestos, and leadâhave been considered separate and mutually exclusive problems. This fragmentation in the analysis of pollution as a threat to health means that only fractured interventions are possible, reducing enormously the total impact. A more holistic approach to cost-effective control strategies to address environmental pollution is needed. Successful examples of control strategies in high-income countries have been those that reduce exposure at source, such as removal of lead from gasoline, national bans of asbestos, and policies to reduce water and air pollution. Such strategies have proved to be incredibly cost-effective. Removal of lead from gasoline has returned approximately $200 billion to the US economy each year since 1980. Policies aiming to prevent rather than assess the absolute proof of toxicity of certain types of toxic chemicals should also be implemented if such a holistic approach is to be taken. In October, 2017, The Lancet, together with the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, will publish a Commission on Pollution, Health, and Development. The Commission will aim to catalyse attention to this escalating planetary danger, increase resources allocated for it, and initiate coordination of policy action at the global level. Environmental pollution should be tackled from multiple perspectives, including social, economic, legislative, and environmental approaches. Initiatives to change our lifestyles to protect health and preserve our planet from the assault of this preventable disease also need to be encouraged. It is time to take action to control the endemic pollution of our world.",

In the Earth's history there have been five mass extinction events, most recently the CretaceousâTertiary mass extinction that occurred almost 65 million years ago and was thought to have been caused by the massive impact of an asteroid on Planet Earth. In the 21st century, we face a sixth mass extinction. According to an article published in July by Gerardo Ceballos and colleagues, the Earth is experiencing a huge decline in species' populations and a great reduction in their range that could have profound effects on the ecosystems on which human civilisation depends.",

The analysis showed that the 5-day average exposure of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was associated with an increased risk in emergency room visits for upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease. In cities, NO2 is most often a byproduct of combustion of fossil fuels from automobiles.2Brunekreef B Holgate ST Air pollution and health.Lancet. 2002; 360: 1233-1242Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar The results of Tian and colleagues' study are novel and provocative. They raise an important question: can the air we breathe trigger bleeding from an ulcer in the upper gastrointestinal tract? Upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease is a common life-threatening medical condition.3Quan S Frolkis A Milne K et al.Upper-gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease: incidence and outcomes.World J Gastroenterol. 2014; 20: 17568-17577Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar However, historically, peptic ulcer disease was an uncommon ailment. The rise in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease occurred in the mid-1800s.4Duggan JM Duggan AE The possible causes of the pandemic of peptic ulcer in the late 19th and early 20th century.Med J Aust. 2006; 185: 667-669PubMed Google Scholar At that time, studies in North America and Europe recognised peptic ulcer disease as an important cause of mortality. The incidence of peptic ulcer disease peaked in the latter part of the 19th century and into the early 1900s. However, by the mid-1900s the incidence of peptic ulcer disease began to decrease and subsequently stabilise in regions across the world.4Duggan JM Duggan AE The possible causes of the pandemic of peptic ulcer in the late 19th and early 20th century.Med J Aust. 2006; 185: 667-669PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sung JJ Kuipers EJ El-Serag HB Systematic review: the global incidence and prevalence of peptic ulcer disease.Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2009; 29: 938-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar The fluctuation in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease over the past two centuries has been retrospectively explained, in part, by the two most common risk factors of peptic ulcer disease: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Helicobacter pylori.6Laine L Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastropathy.Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am. 1996; 6: 489-504PubMed Google Scholar, 7Perez-Aisa MA Del Pino D Siles M Lanas A Clinical trends in ulcer diagnosis in a population with high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection.Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2005; 21: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar The first NSAID was aspirin, which was introduced in 1899 and contributed to the cause of peptic ulcer disease thereafter. H pylori is a bacterium of the stomach that is a major contributor to the incidence of peptic ulcer disease, with some researchers postulating that a virulent strain led to a spike in mortality in the 1800s.4Duggan JM Duggan AE The possible causes of the pandemic of peptic ulcer in the late 19th and early 20th century.Med J Aust. 2006; 185: 667-669PubMed Google Scholar However, peptic ulcer disease often manifests in individuals without a history of NSAID exposure and who are not colonised with H pylori. Other unknown risk factors of peptic ulcer disease are yet to be discovered. Industrialisation of societies in the 1800s led to urbanisation of populations into cities who often lived in proximity to the factories that polluted the air. The human health impacts of air pollution exposure are well known, with the earliest studies noting its effect on respiratory system.2Brunekreef B Holgate ST Air pollution and health.Lancet. 2002; 360: 1233-1242Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar Over the past few decades, several studies have also shown the multi-organ effects of air pollution: breathing air pollution does not limit its effects on health to the lungs.1Tian L Qiu H Sun S Tsang H Chan K Leung WK Association between emergency admission for peptic ulcer bleeding and air pollution: a case-crossover analysis in Hong Kong's elderly population.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e74-e81Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar Over the past decade epidemiological studies have documented that air pollution is associated with the development of gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases and appendicitis.8Kaplan G Air pollution and the inflammatory bowel diseases.Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2011; 17: 1146-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 9Kaplan GG Dixon E Panaccione R et al.Effect of ambient air pollution on the incidence of appendicitis.CMAJ. 2009; 181: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Kaplan GG Tanyingoh D Dixon E et al.Ambient ozone concentrations and the risk of perforated and nonperforated appendicitis: a multicity case-crossover study.Environ Health Perspect. 2013; 121: 939-943PubMed Google Scholar Basic scientific studies have shown that air pollution might mediate gastrointestinal effects by exacerbating inflammation in the intestines and by altering the composition of the intestinal microbiome.11Kish L Hotte N Kaplan GG et al.Environmental particulate matter induces murine intestinal inflammatory responses and alters the gut microbiome.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e62220Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Kaplan GG Szyszkowicz M Fichna J et al.Non-specific abdominal pain and air pollution: a novel association.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e47669Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar Consequently, air pollution could conceivably promote upper gastrointestinal bleeding from peptic ulcer disease by influencing the inflammatory pathways in the stomach or possibly interacting with pathogens of upper gastrointestinal tract such as H pylori. My research team led one of the earliest studies to explore this hypothesis.13Quan S Yang H Tanyingoh D et al.Upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease is not associated with air pollution: a case-crossover study.BMC gastroenterology. 2015; 15: 131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar We did a multi-city (Calgary and Edmonton, AB, Canada) time-stratified case crossover study to assess the effects of NO2, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone, as well as particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of 10 Î¼m or less and 2Â·5 Î¼m or less. We assessed several models that included different exposure periods, and stratification by age (younger than and older than 70 years), and sex. Although sporadic significant associations were detected, they were not consistent across both cities. Thus, we concluded that these associations were spurious and that a strong signal connecting air pollution exposure with upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer bleeding was not present.13Quan S Yang H Tanyingoh D et al.Upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease is not associated with air pollution: a case-crossover study.BMC gastroenterology. 2015; 15: 131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar However, our negative study does not refute the findings by Tian and colleagues,1Tian L Qiu H Sun S Tsang H Chan K Leung WK Association between emergency admission for peptic ulcer bleeding and air pollution: a case-crossover analysis in Hong Kong's elderly population.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e74-e81Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar because important differences between the studies could lead to differential results. Our study populations were distinct, with the majority of individuals in our study being Caucasian in Alberta, and in Tian and colleagues' study being Asian in Hong Kong. Additionally, exposure to air pollution is different between cities. For example, the average daily concentration of NO2 in Alberta was 23Â·9 Î¼g/m3,13Quan S Yang H Tanyingoh D et al.Upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease is not associated with air pollution: a case-crossover study.BMC gastroenterology. 2015; 15: 131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar whereas the average daily concentration in Hong Kong was nearly double at 55Â·7 Î¼g/m3.1Tian L Qiu H Sun S Tsang H Chan K Leung WK Association between emergency admission for peptic ulcer bleeding and air pollution: a case-crossover analysis in Hong Kong's elderly population.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e74-e81Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar A threshold level of NO2 may be necessary to trigger a health event such as bleeding from an ulcer. These differences highlight the need to assess the health effects of air pollution in different regions and study populations. So could air pollution be a novel risk factor for upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease in Asian populations? Although it is an intriguing hypothesis, we must consider important limitations of air pollution research. Studies using fixed-site monitoring data rather than personal monitoring data are subject to misclassification of the exposure because fixed site monitors do not account for individual mobility that affect exposure. Although, this typically results in non-differential exposure misclassification that underestimates the risk of air pollution.14Schwartz J The effects of particulate air pollution on daily deaths: a multi-city case crossover analysis.Occup Environ Med. 2004; 61: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar Additionally, fixed-site monitors average the exposure of air pollution in a region, thereby not accounting for the geospatial variation of air pollution levels in a region.14Schwartz J The effects of particulate air pollution on daily deaths: a multi-city case crossover analysis.Occup Environ Med. 2004; 61: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar Future studies could incorporate land use regression models to assess the interaction of spatial differences of air pollution across a city along with acute temporal variation.15Bertazzon S Johnson M Eccles K Kaplan GG Accounting for spatial effects in land use regression for urban air pollution modeling.Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol. 2015; 14â15: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar Misclassification of the cases is also an important consideration. The study used International Classification Disease (ICD-9) codes to identify patients presenting to the emergency department with upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease. All studies relying on administrative databases unfortunately include false-positive cases and miss true cases.16Molodecky NA Panaccione R Ghosh S Barkema HW Kaplan GG Alberta Inflammatory Bowel Disease ConsortiumChallenges associated with identifying the environmental determinants of the inflammatory bowel diseases.Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2011; 17: 1792-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar Furthermore, in case crossover studies, cases serve as their own controls. Because within-individual comparisons are being made, confounding from time-independent risk factors (eg, colonization by H pylori) are controlled for by the design of the study. However, residual confounding might occur with time-dependent factors such as NSAIDs, whose use might vary day by day.14Schwartz J The effects of particulate air pollution on daily deaths: a multi-city case crossover analysis.Occup Environ Med. 2004; 61: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar Air pollution studies can also be limited by multiple comparison errors because associations are explored with multiple pollutants and across several exposure time periods. Consequently, the probability of observing statistically significant findings by chance alone is increased.14Schwartz J The effects of particulate air pollution on daily deaths: a multi-city case crossover analysis.Occup Environ Med. 2004; 61: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar Tian and colleagues attempted to account for chance findings by including positive control cohorts of respiratory and circulatory diseases that are well known to be affected by acute elevation in air pollution exposures. Nonetheless, replication studies are necessary in other cities in Asia with similar levels of air pollution. Tian and colleagues' Article suggests that upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease might be triggered by exposure to high levels of NO2 in elderly patients living in Hong Kong. If these findings are corroborated in the future, then the association between air pollution and peptic ulcer disease would add to a growing body of scientific literature suggesting that air pollution can harm the gastrointestinal tract.17Beamish LA Osornio-Vargas AR Wine E Air pollution: an environmental factor contributing to intestinal disease.J Crohns Colitis. 2011; 5: 279-286Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar Moreover, air pollution is a modifiable and avoidable risk factor. If air pollution promotes the onset of upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease, then policies to reduce emissions could be preventive policies. Additionally, clinicians can warn elderly patients at risk of peptic ulcer disease to avoid outdoor exposures on days of high NO2 levels. I declare no competing interests. Association between emergency admission for peptic ulcer bleeding and air pollution: a case-crossover analysis in Hong Kong's elderly populationShort-term elevation in ambient NO2 might trigger peptic ulcer bleeding events and increase the risk of emergency admissions for peptic ulcer bleeding in Hong Kong's elderly population. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that air pollution affects not just cardiopulmonary diseases, but also certain diseases of the digestive system. Full-Text PDF Open Access",

By coincidence, this figure is about the same number of people who were killed in China, every day, in 2015 by causes linked to ambient air pollution: a total of 1Â·1 million people. In The Lancet, Cohen and colleagues carried out an impressive analysis of global and country-level air pollution from ground and satellite data and used these data, as well as estimates for population exposure and risk factors, to analyse trends in the number of deaths caused by air pollution between 1990 and 2015.1Cohen AJ Brauer M Burnett R et al.Estimates and 25-year trends of the global burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution: an analysis of data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1907-1918Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar A 20% increase in the number of deaths caused by ambient fine particulate matter (<2Â·5 Î¼m in diameter [PM2Â·5]) was observed during this period, from 3Â·5 million to 4Â·2 million.

Regarding air pollution, regulations as well as the use of technologies that reduce vehicle emissions are important but not enough. The huge increase in car fleets associated with traffic jams, notably in big cities, demands air quality monitoring and periodic vehicle emission tests. Most large (>1 million people) cities in Brazil have no air quality monitoring and there are no current mandatory emission tests either. Brazil's largest city, SÃ£o Paulo, has air quality monitoring but no emission tests on its more than 8 million vehicles. Diesel trucks releasing black exhaust smoke are common in Brazil and will continue to be until the government acts. Proportional differences in deaths due to air pollution exist between Brazil and countries like China, where air pollution is more severe and the population affected is larger; but any illness or death from air pollution is extremely relevant for the population affected. The ways to control air pollution are widely known. We need governments to give this theme the importance it deserves. The same lack of attention to air pollution has been observed in several countries even after so many data relating air pollution to adverse health effects and deaths are available. The USA and Japan are good examples of countries that faced high air pollution levels and managed to lower them, saving probably millions of lives over the past few decades. China has been trying to control air pollution as well, but it still has a long way to go. It is time for other countries do the same. I declare no competing interests.",

    "ab": "Climate change and environmental degradation have been recognised as the most crucial public health challenge of our time.1Watts N Adger WN Agnolucci P et al.Health and climate change: policy responses to protect public health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1861-1914Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar For public health professionals, there is a clear obligation and opportunity for leadership around the health sector response to this issue. Public health can proffer our skills in evidence appraisal, multi-disciplinary partnerships, advocacy, and development of health policy to embed the understanding that long-term health and environmental sustainability are synonymous. We must clearly articulate the substantial health benefits of sustainable development and work with partners on effective strategies to realise these benefits. Such efforts build on the natural history of public health to engage and advocate on the wider determinants of health and wellbeing of our communities. But how do we move climate change from being a niche public health specialism to a mainstream norm of our discipline? A crucial first step is to embed the expectation that environmental leadership is a fundamental core competency for public health professionals. In their 2015 specialty training curriculum,2Faculty of Public HealthPublic health specialty training curriculum.http://www.fph.org.uk/uploads/PH%20Curriculum%202015_approved.pdfDate: 2015Google Scholar the Faculty of Public Health (who regulate and oversee public health consultant training in the UK) introduced both an overarching statement on environmental sustainability and a specific learning outcome on environmental sustainability leadership. As a result, every public health registrar is now expected to show evidence of leadership in environmental sustainability during their training. The need to meet this new expectation in training is now driving interest and engagement from public health trainees across the UK. A long-standing national network for trainees in sustainable development has used this momentum to initiate a review of UK policies on public health training and practice, as both a stocktake and an opportunity for identifying further action. The resulting report3UK Public Health Registrar Sustainable Development NetworkEmbedding sustainable development in public health training in the United Kingdom: training regions update report.http://www.fph.org.uk/uploads/Embedding%20Sustainable%20Development%20in%20Public%20Health%20Training.pdfDate: March 2017Google Scholar identified several areas of success including: (1) in every training region, registrars received effective communication on sustainable development issues and opportunities for action; (2) sustainable development was incorporated into the induction programmes of new public health registrars; (3) placement opportunities for registrars to gain leadership experience around sustainable development and climate change were faciliatated and signposted; and (4) travel policies and working arrangements were reviewed to reduce the carbon footprint of public health training (eg, teleconferencing or videoconferencing, active travel options, and remote working). The Faculty of Public Health and Training Programme Directors from the 13 public health specialty schools across the UK helped facilitate the production of this report by providing advice, assisting in the audit, and ensuring registrars were given time to complete the work. Such support recognises the unique set of skills that public health professionals can offer in moving this issue forward, including a passion for population health, negotiation, evidence-based practice, and framing the issue for diverse stakeholders. As the health and care system begin to embrace the health gains from sustainable development, we look forward to continuing to turn the threat of climate change into an opportunity to improve the health and wellbeing of our communities.

    "ab": "The effects of human activities on planetary ecosystems are nearing a point of no return. It is getting increasingly clear that population-wide behavioural changes will have to be the basis of any solution.1Nyborg K Anderies JM Dannenberg A et al.Social norms as solution.Science. 2016; 354: 42-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 2Amel E Manning C Scott B Koger S Beyond the roots of human inaction: fostering collective effort toward ecosystem conservation.Science. 2017; 356: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3Crist E Mora C Engelman R The interaction of human population, food production, and biodiversity protection.Science. 2017; 356: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 4Guitton MJ The water challenges: alternative paths to trigger large-scale behavioural shifts.Lancet Plan Health. 2017; 1: e46-e47Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar Yet, in order for such changes to occur, a substantial proportion of the population has to be willing to endorse them. Because health professionals are heavily connected with all layers of the population and can have a major impact on societal issues,5Faulkner LR McCurdy RL Teaching medical students social responsibility: the right thing to do.Acad Med. 2000; 75: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6Goodman B Developing the concept of sustainability in nursing.Nurs Philos. 2016; 17: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 7Moser AM Stigier FL Haditsch B Physicians' responsibility for planetary health.Lancet Plan Health. 2017; 1: e56Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (6) Google Scholar they might be able to encourage positive changes. Getting professionals invested in the desired transformation could be done through training. In other words, health professionals' education could be a gate to global sustainability and a planetary health revolution. Although appealing, this general concept does not tell much about how to put the ideas into practice. How can health professionals be encouraged to get involved and be concerned about planetary health issues? How can they be given the knowledge and the will to invest in this mission? In other words, how can the desired behavioural changes be put into action? These questions are far from trivial, because the overwhelming majority of physicians are not equipped to face the changes that population health will go through in the climate change era.8Valois P Blouin P Ouellet C Renaud JS BÃ©langer D Gosselin P The health impacts of climate change: a continuing medical education needs assessment framework.J Contin Educ Health Prof. 2016; 36: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar The acquisition of an operative sustainability health expertise by health professionals could be divided into two aspects: increasing awareness of the social accountability inherent to being a health professional in an endangered planetary context (mindset); and enhancing the basic and applied knowledge of how the changing conditions of Earth will affect human health (expertise). Sustainability skills should not be considered as ectopic in the context of health professional training. Indeed, human health is actualised in the biosphere in which we live. The changing conditions of Earth's biosphere will inevitably affect human health. Planetary health is inherently interdisciplinary, and should be taught in an interdisciplinary context. Optimal strategies should concomitantly adopt varied and complementary pedagogical tools. The first approach to knowledge acquisition is the classic method: conventional courses provided by expert teachers. The main problem with this approach is that experts who can provide lessons in this field are scarce. Universities could rely on specialists with neighbouring expertise, such as sustainability experts, geologists, social scientists, or ecology scholars. Even if conventional classroom-type lectures by external (non-health sciences) teachers could provide a way of imparting primary knowledge to students of health-care professions, a major interdisciplinary dialogue would nonetheless be required to optimise course content to target this very specific population of health-care students. Yet, medical education is not just a process of knowledge acquisition, but also, maybe more importantly, it is the acquisition of skills and new ways of thinking.9Rodriguez-Paz JM Kennedy M Salas E et al.Beyond âsee one, do one, teach oneâ: toward a different training paradigm.Postgrad Med J. 2009; 85: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar Although conventional courses are a perfectly legitimate way to acquire specific theoretical knowledge, a major component of the training of health-care professionals relies on practical training in clinical settings, which is traditionally provided under the guidance of mentors with backgrounds similar to those of the students. For clinical mentors to train students in global sustainability skills, the mentors have to be trained first. This training would happen only at the very earliest after one student generation. However, the challenges that the Earth is facing cannot wait; the training of mentors needs to be accelerated. Online-based pedagogical tools, such as online communities of learning or university-triggered massive online open courses could provide interesting solutions. Unfortunately, educational systems are often refractory to change, and the necessary evolution in health sciences teaching is likely to face possible inertia, including from teachers themselves. Medical schools would have to use some motivating factor to facilitate the transition from current models to more integrative models, and one possible path is the control over advancement of the professorial career. A constructive way to promote involvement of clinical mentors in sustainability would be to acknowledge their efforts to enhance their own skills in this field. Clearly, such approaches should be widespread. As a planet, Earth is a fully integrated system, and environmental problems are global. Trying to solve these planetary issues with only local approaches will fail. Integrating active sustainability leadership with health-care responsibility cannot be the fight of a few countries: a global endeavour is needed to achieve a global impact. However, this might not be feasible in reality. Indeed, the problem of unequal repartition of resources takes its full meaning in the context of this global crisis: developing countries are confronted with more environmental problems, but with less-educated populations and fewer academic resources. Knowledge transfers are clearly necessary, yet such noble goals might not be easy to achieve.10Babich LP Bicknell WJ Culpepper L Jack BW Social responsibility, international development, and institutional commitment: lessons from the Boston University experience.Acad Med. 2008; 83: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar Indeed, developed countries have their own agenda. In the current economic situation of scarce resources, developed countries need the full power of their academic resources to train their health professionals to satisfy the needs of their own populations. Although international collaborations between developed and developing countries are commendable, they are clearly unbalanced. Once again, virtual space-conveyed education could provide some interesting complementary solutions to this problem by providing powerful cost-efficient media to help the circulation of ideas and knowledge. Such initiatives would thus be a testimony to the social accountability of the richest countries by providing ways for others to implement health sustainability in their health systems. That would be true expression of sustainability development: from local actions to helping the human population as a whole. We declare no competing interests. Cognition, heuristics, and biases behind environment-related behavioursWe read with great interest Matthieu Guitton and Julien Poitras' Comment1 published in The Lancet Planetary Health, and we would like to reinforce the importance of environmental education for health professionals. Particularly, some health disciplinesâsuch as Psychology, which is often neglected in this fieldâmight have a cardinal role in environmental protection because they can help to support the delicate and long process of changing people's attitudes and behaviours for the protection of the environment they live in.

    "ab": "Climate change is a global concern for reasons far beyond environmental preservation. Modern societies have developed over centuries with agricultural, economic, and social systems acclimated to climate patterns that have been remarkably stable. The rapid, human-induced, climate change now underway presents grave new risks for geopolitical and societal stabilityâboth foundational prerequisites for global prosperity, wellbeing, and health. The most commonly identified risk to stability from climate change stems from its role as a stress multiplier in already vulnerable regions of the world.1CNANational Security and the threat of climate change. The CNA Corporation, 2007https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/pdf/National%20Security%20and%20the%20Threat%20of%20Climate%20Change.pdfGoogle Scholar The Arab Spring can be cited as a case example of how climate-exacerbated shortages of food and water can spark existing tensions.2Werrell CE Femia F Slaughter AM The Arab Spring and climate change. Centre for American Progress, 2013https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2013/02/28/54579/the-arab-spring-and-climate-change/Google Scholar Yet numerous countries around the world are already experiencing similarly combined pains of food and water shortages, rapid population growth, and weak governance.3Development, Concepts and Doctrine CentreGlobal strategic trends out to 2045. UK Ministry of Defence, 2014https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-strategic-trends-out-to-2045Google Scholar The additional strain of extreme weather events (eg, droughts, heat waves, or flooding) or changes in long-stable climate patterns on the livelihoods and social fabric of these countries notably increases the risk of societal instability. In some cases, these strains manifest as drivers for the mass movement of people within and between countries. Peter Gleick4Gleick PH Water, drought, climate change, and conflict in Syria.Weather Clim Soc. 2014; 6: 331-340Crossref Scopus (423) Google Scholar highlighted how the movement of farmers from rural areas to cities, and the subsequent stress that this movement placed on the urban communities, was one contributing factor to the conflict in Syria, itself a driver of the migration crisis in Europe. In other cases, where populations are unable to relocate, they must find alternative sources of income and food, making elements within them increasingly susceptible to recruitment by radicalising non-state actors, such as Al-Qaeda or Boko Haram.5US Department of Defense2014 climate change adaptation roadmap.https://www.scribd.com/doc/242845848/Read-DoD-report-2014-Climate-Change-Adaptation-RoadmapGoogle Scholar In all cases, the foundational stability required to build prosperous, healthy societies, is jeopardised. The impact of these risks cannot be isolated in our globalised world. Increased migration pressures and radical terrorism are international challenges. But the interconnected risks go deeper. With instability, or even just increased risk, in regions such as the Middle East and North Africa and the Sahel comes volatility in the prices of raw materials and energy; potential disruption to supply chains; and the loss of markets for finished products. All of these factors impact the stability of the global economy and, to differing degrees, that of every nation. Economic risks of climate change are too manifold to cover here.6Stern NP The economics of climate change: the Stern review. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2007Crossref Scopus (6203) Google Scholar But in an era increasingly defined by the politics of perceived scarcity and inequality, the cumulative risk to national and global economic productivity represents an important catalyst of social tensions. Although limiting climate risk cannot alleviate the underling tensions, it would at least avoid exacerbating them. One interconnected health-economic risk that has, to date, been insufficiently examined is that of climate change impacts on the already pressured health-care systems of developed countries. In the past four decades, the demands of ageing populations, expanding prevalence of chronic disease, the delivery of new innovative techniques, and increasing public expectations have led to roughly a doubling the share of gross domestic product (GDP) that Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries spend on health care; future projections anticipate a similar increase in the next four decades.7Maisonneuve C Martins JO The future of health and long-term care spending.OECD J: Econ Stud. 2014; 2014: 61-96Crossref Google Scholar However, in the case of OECD countries these projections make no mention of climate change. According to WHO, the health impacts of climate change will include temperature-related illness and death; injuries and illness due to extreme weather events; the spread of infectious disease vectors; increases in water-borne illness; and wide-ranging impacts from air pollution.8WHOClimate change and human health.http://www.who.int/globalchange/environment/en/Google Scholar Accurately projecting the consequences of these impacts on national health-care costs will not be easy. Such estimation will be even more challenging in the case of developing and emerging economies, where the foundations for modern health care are still being laid. But given the increasing scale of health-care costs relative to GDP, answering this question is essential, and some non OECD countries, including in the Middle East and North Africa, have done so.9Sileem HH Health expenditure, climate changes and corruption in the MENA region: a Granger causality approach.J Afr Dev. 2016; 18: 61-72Google Scholar Failure by all countries to plan for these impacts risks the stability of both our national financial and health-care systems. Reduction of the long-term risks of climate change to planetary health requires substantial cuts to global greenhouse gas emissions. The focus for that activity is the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change process and, in particular, moving forward on the agreements reached in Paris in 2015. However, it is equally important that nations act today to address the near-term risks already posed by the climatic change being brought about by previous emissions and locked into the system for the near-future. This action will require an integrated, pan-governmental, and intergovernmental approach. To date, international and national institutions have been slow to adapt; issues are still addressed in isolation. The onus is on governments to lead and they need to understand that action will be required not just by themselves but also between government and all of society. Only then will a coherent approach that addresses all the negative aspects of a changing climate be possible; 21st century challenges require 21st century solutions.

    "ab": "There is strong epidemiological evidence that inhalation of combustion-derived soot triggers life-threatening cardiovascular events. Indeed, the 2015 Global Burden of Disease estimated that 1 521 000 (35%) of the total of 4 241 000 deaths attributable to ambient particulate matter (PM; all causes) were from ischaemic heart disease.1GBD Risk Factors CollaboratorsGlobal, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990â2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.Lancet. 2016; 388: 1659-1724Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar But policy makers continue to regard these mortality figures with scepticism, and delay enacting the urgent interventions that will significantly reduce population exposure to air pollution. For example in the UK, there is no national plan to replace the present highly polluting fleet of diesel cars, vans, and taxis. Potential reasons for this scepticism include difficulty in communicating to non-specialists the methods used to attribute deaths to air pollution,2WHO Regional Office for EuropeHealth and environment: communicating the risks.http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/233759/e96930.pdfGoogle Scholar and the absence of experimental data directly linking inhalation of PM to cardiovascular disturbances known to cause fatal events. The study by Franco Folino and colleagues, addresses this latter issue by linking air pollution data from the Vento region of Italy with ventricular arrhythmia data stored by implanted defibrillators. Folino and colleagues report a significant association between episodes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation and PM of less than 2Â·5 Î¼m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2Â·5),3Folino F Buja G Zanotto G et al.Association between air pollution and ventricular arrhythmias in high-risk patients (ARIA study): a multicentre longitudinal study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e58-e64Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar a result that both strengthens the case for a causal association between PM and cardiovascular deaths, and suggests further innovative studies. First, by adding personal carbonaceous PM monitoring to this group of high-risk patients (figure), it should be possible to determine the independent association between locally generated traffic PM and arrhythmias. Second, contribution of fossil fuel and wood smoke to background PM in the Vento region offers a way of assessing the effect of different types of PM. Indeed, in-vitro toxicity studies suggest that not all particles are equal. For example, wood smoke PM, compared with diesel PM, induces higher levels of oxidative damage to human umbilical endothelial cells and stimulates increased monocyte adhesion.4Forchhammer L Loft S Roursgaard M et al.Expression of adhesion molecules, monocyte interactions and oxidative stress in human endothelial cells exposed to wood smoke and diesel exhaust particulate matter.Toxicol Lett. 2012; 209: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar Normally, ambient black carbon from fossil-fuel combustion is measured by an aethalometer using infrared light absorption. However, some of the larger aethalometers also assess ultra-violet light absorption, a spectrum that detects aromatic organic compounds found in wood smoke and other biomass sources. Thus, light absorption from both wavelengths could be used to identify the independent effect of background wood smoke PM on arrhythmiasâa result that would be highly relevant to exposures in low-income countries, where wood burning is a major source of personal exposure to carbonaceous PM.5Gordon SB Bruce NG Grigg J et al.Respiratory risks from household air pollution in low and middle income countries.Lancet Respir Med. 2014; 2: 823-860Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar What should clinicians tell high-risk cardiovascular patients about air pollution? To date, management guidelines provide little or no guidance. A recent workshop hosted by the European Respiratory Society addressed this question and identified two major areas that should be considered by future guidelines.6Powell P Brunekreef B Grigg J How do you explain the risk of air pollution to your patients?.Breathe (Sheff). 2016; 12: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar First, patients should understand how acute episodes of poor air quality will affect their own health, and the actions they need to take to protect themselves. Second, health-care providers need the tools to advise patients about air pollution and how to change their treatment plans or activities on high pollution days, and how to reduce long-term exposure.6Powell P Brunekreef B Grigg J How do you explain the risk of air pollution to your patients?.Breathe (Sheff). 2016; 12: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar In some cities, patients are able to sign up to text message services that warn about pollution and provide advice about how to reduce short-term risk. For example, London's airText's advice to adults with heart problems on very high pollution days is to \"avoid strenuous physical activity\".7airTextPollution index and health advice.http://www.airtext.info/healthGoogle Scholar It remains unclear, however, whether this, albeit sensible, advice reduces the daily dose of particles inhaled into the lungs. Use of a facemask on high pollution days is another option that patients are increasingly asking clinicians about. Facemasks are socially acceptable in countries such as China, and are widely used by urban cyclists in many other countries. Preliminary evidence for the efficacy of facemasks was provided by a randomised crossover trial8Langrish JP Li X Wang S et al.Reducing personal exposure to particulate air pollution improves cardiovascular health in patients with coronary heart disease.Environ Health Perspect. 2012; 120: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar of patients with coronary heart disease who walked a predefined route in central Beijing, China, with and without a facemask. The study found that the facemask was well tolerated, reduced maximal ST segment depression, and increased heart rate variability.8Langrish JP Li X Wang S et al.Reducing personal exposure to particulate air pollution improves cardiovascular health in patients with coronary heart disease.Environ Health Perspect. 2012; 120: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar Avoidance of pollution hotspots from local road traffic is a possible way of reducing long-term exposure. The UK charity Global Action Plan combined short-term and long-term advice in its patient information pack.9Global Action PlanAir quality.https://www.globalactionplan.org.uk/Pages/Category/air-qualityGoogle Scholar The pack includes a map of local high-pollution streets, and recommends regular use of less polluted routes (using the map), travel outside the rush hour, and regular checking of the daily air pollution forecast. In summary, we urgently need more evidence to identify the most effective personal exposure reduction strategies. In developing this evidence, clinicians should not forget to continue to challenge governments to implement national policies that significantly reduce air pollution. Jonathan Grigg is part-funded by the NIHR North Thames Collaboration of Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care. Association between air pollution and ventricular arrhythmias in high-risk patients (ARIA study): a multicentre longitudinal studyParticulate matter has acute pro-arrhythmic effects in a population of high-risk patients, which increase on exposure to fine particles and in patients who have experienced a previous myocardial infarction. The time sequence of the arrhythmic events suggests there is an underlying neurally mediated mechanism. From a clinical point of view, the results of our study should encourage physicians to also consider environmental risk when addressing the prevention of arrhythmic events, particularly in patients with coronary heart disease, advising them to avoid exposure to high levels of fine particulate matter.

    "ab": "The answer to a controversial question on the British Broadcasting Corporation website, \"Are Kenya ranch invasions driven by drought or politics?\",1Leithead A Are Kenya ranch invasions driven by drought or politics?.http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38866389Date: Feb 4, 2017Google Scholar is a convoluted yes. This headline harkens back to my public health experiences in Africa and the concept of relative drought, which I coined as a global health educator to help to explain how the overuse of resources is a serious threat to quality of life and exacerbates the consequences of drought in low-income countries. The concept of relative drought implies far more than just a decline in precipitation. Presume that a village has sufficient resources to sustain a population of 100 people and a water source to support domestic needs and agricultural crops and livestock. However, a natural population increase to 200 people puts pressure on resourcesâlocal traditional herders now require more water and grazing resources for an increased number of livestock. Relative drought thus embraces a complex definition that is compounded by entrenched social, political, and economic realities. The village's water resource is unchanged, but is only able to support the original population size. With insufficient water, this community will fail because the carrying capacity of the environment can no longer meet the demands. While doing epidemiological research 25 years ago in the Lesotho Highlands of southern Africa, I observed a well intentioned range management demonstration project. Organised by an international non-governmental organisation and associated local livestock owners,2American AG InternationalLesotho Agricultural Production and Institutional Support Project.http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Xdabh027a.pdfDate: 1992Google Scholar seasonal grazing areas were protected with fencing, which was intended as an educational model. A reduction in uncontrolled livestock pressures could provide some assurance that rotational grazing would be sustainable. As a result, grassland pastures flourished. However, some herders saw this benefit as an opportunity to keep an excessive number of goats, sheep, cattle, and horsesâmore undernourished animals won the value calculation compared with fewer fattened and healthier livestock, which led to the programme's failure. Livestock fencing was intentionally breached and overgrazing quickly left vegetation sparse and little opportunity for spent pasture restoration. Environmental pressure on this area was unsustainable thereby creating a state of drought. History nonetheless repeats itself: the British Broadcasting Corporation reported that traditional herders invaded protected pasture near Mount Kenya with thousands of cattle.1Leithead A Are Kenya ranch invasions driven by drought or politics?.http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38866389Date: Feb 4, 2017Google Scholar Formerly, agreements between landowners and herders restricted overgrazing that would upset the delicate balance of parched savannah grassland. Although extended drought is justifiably blamed for the loss of productive pastureland, poor range management is a serious underlying contributor. The savannah is being decimated by excessive population demands and political measures that are ineffective in educating local herders about exploitation excess. Drought has plagued northern Kenya in recent years. As water supplies have diminished in the Lake Turkana region, semi-nomadic tribes along the KenyanâEthiopian border come into conflict because herders have insufficient grazing and water to sustain their livestock. Agricultural yields are insufficient3Yale Environment 360When the water ends: Africa's climate conflicts.http://e360.yale.edu/feature/when_the_water_ends_africas_climate_conflicts/2331/Date: Oct 26, 2010Google Scholar and consequential food insecurity has required assistance from governmental agencies and non-governmental organisations. However, the fact that Kenya's population has grown to more than 48 million in 2017, which is an increase of 120% over the past 30 years, is concerning.4WorldometersKenya population.http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/kenya-population/Google Scholar Certainly, this is not a problem faced in east Africa alone, as drought is an all too frequent occurrence across the continent. Although drought can occur globally, perhaps Africa is a special case, where more than half of the predicted world population growth over the next 30 years will occur. Of the world population of 9Â·7 billion projected by 2050, 25% will reside in Africa.5Ferris R World population: quarter of Earth will be African in 2050.http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/30/world-population-quarter-of-earth-will-be-african-in-2050.htmlDate: July 30, 2015Google Scholar, 6Khokhar T Kashiwase H The future of the world's population in 4 charts.http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/future-world-s-population-4-chartsDate: Aug 5, 2015Google Scholar Community outreach programmes engaging government and committed local citizens should address agricultural priorities, water management, population constraints, and public health to emphasise the hazards of living beyond the carrying capacity of the environment. Without concerted and remedial attention to these complex issues, quality of life cannot improve in Kenya or similar world ecosystems unless stressors that magnify drought are clearly identified and mitigated.

Nepal faces floods every monsoon season, alongside other types of natural disasters, including earthquakes. The Climate Risk Index, which quantifies the effects of extreme weather events in terms of vulnerabilities and economic losses, estimates that the loss of assets incurred by disasters in Nepal in 2014 was more than US$140 million.4Kreft S Eckstein D Dorsch L Fische L Global climate risk index 2016.

Weather-related loss events in 2014 and 1995 to 2014.https://germanwatch.org/fr/download/13503.pdfGoogle Scholar As illustrated by the devastating 2015 Gorhka Earthquake, the disaster vulnerability of Nepal is shaped by its geography. Most people reside in hilly places, where the risk of landslides is high, or in the lowlands of the southern plains, where inundation during monsoon is inevitable. To make matters worse, a long-lasting bilateral conflict with India has complicated Nepal's response to disasters. One representative example of exacerbated disaster damage due to bilateral conflict can be seen following the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake. Following Nepal's promulgation of a new Constitution in September, 2015, 6 months after the earthquake, the border between Nepal and India has been blocked.5Mishra SR Sharma A Khanal V Health diplomacy to tackle the crisis in Nepal.Lancet. 2016; 388: 463-464Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar The blockade has disturbed production, transportation, and distribution of medicines, as well as other products across the countries, restricting the provision of basic health and emergency services, and reducing the quality of daily living; all of which have probably complicated the disaster response and recovery of Nepal.5Mishra SR Sharma A Khanal V Health diplomacy to tackle the crisis in Nepal.Lancet. 2016; 388: 463-464Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar The effects of the most recent flood were also exacerbated by the bilateral conflict between the two countries,6The Kathmandu PostDisastrous disaster preparedness.http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-08-14/disastrous-disaster-preparedness.htmlGoogle Scholar particularly a new conflict around water management. A major source of the present conflict is the 18 dams and 1355 km long embankment constructed by India parallel to the IndiaâNepal border.6The Kathmandu PostDisastrous disaster preparedness.http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-08-14/disastrous-disaster-preparedness.htmlGoogle Scholar Disagreements have been reported about how often the barrage gates should be opened, and the ways in which the dams might affect inundation of Nepal's southern plains.6The Kathmandu PostDisastrous disaster preparedness.http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-08-14/disastrous-disaster-preparedness.htmlGoogle Scholar Nepal and India have worked together to achieve successful transboundary water management in the past, as accentuated in the successful example of the Mahakali River Treaty, and there have been calls for further cooperation in the general river management and flood control, which could equally affect the safety and daily living of people in both countries.7Salman SMA Uprety K Mahakali river.in: Van Puymbroeck RV Conflict and cooperation on South Asia's international rivers: a legal perspective. Kluwer Law International, Hague2003: 97-118Google Scholar As the effects of global warming continue to increase, the health burdens of climate-related natural disasters, including floods, hurricanes, and cyclones, are on the rise worldwide.8Forzieri G Cescatti A e Silva FB Feyen L Increasing risk over time of weather-related hazards to the European population: a data-driven prognostic study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: 200-208Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar Furthermore, political conflicts, particularly water conflicts, are thought to be intensifying because of population growth and climate change worldwide.9Petersen-Perlman JD Veilleux JC Wolf AT International water conflict and cooperation: challenges and opportunities.Water Int. 2017; 42: 105-120Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar Given that water conflicts between countries can worsen the damage associated with natural disasters,9Petersen-Perlman JD Veilleux JC Wolf AT International water conflict and cooperation: challenges and opportunities.Water Int. 2017; 42: 105-120Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar as seen in the current case of Nepal and India, more attention should be paid to the detrimental effects of conflict on human safety in disaster settings. Unfortunately, existing international organisations, such as the International Court of Justice, might not be well prepared to handle bilateral conflicts in disaster settings, especially when urgent responses are required to protect individuals affected by disasters.10International Court of JusticeList of all cases.http://www.icj-cij.org/en/list-of-all-casesGoogle Scholar We underscore the necessity to accelerate a wide range of discussions on how disaster preparedness and management should be undertaken, with an emphasis on its humanitarian aspect, as increasing climate-related disasters are likely to be additionally complicated by current political conflict, leading to new risks to the lives and safety of human beings.

    "ab": "The world lost about 2Â·3 million km2 of forest during the first 12 years of the 21st century, with loss of tropical forest outpacing that of other forest types.1Hansen MC Potapov PV Moore R et al.High-resolution global maps of 21st-century forest cover change.Science. 2013; 342: 850-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (6223) Google Scholar Agricultural expansion and wood extraction are among the leading causes of tropical deforestation, and some human populations clearly benefit from increased food, fuel, wood, and fibre production.2Myers SS Gaffikin L Golden CD et al.Human health impacts of ecosystem alteration.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2013; 110: 18753-18760Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar But what is the cost? In recognition of the profound, long-term effect of deforestation on emissions of greenhouse gases and the global climate, in 2008 the UN established the Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation. The effects of deforestation on climate, however, seem quite distant, reducing the urgency to take action. But what if forest destruction directly and immediately affected child health? What if setting aside forests in protected areas near human communities prevented childhood illnesses? Would that change local, regional, or large-scale forest-management policies for human wellbeing? In an important new study published in this issue of The Lancet Planetary Health, Thomas Pienkowski and colleagues address the effects of protected areas and forest destruction on human health in 35 547 households in Cambodia over 10 years.3Pienkowski T Dickens BL Sun H Carrasco LR Empirical evidence of the public health benefits of tropical forest conservation in Cambodia: a generalised linear mixed-effects model analysis.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e180-e187Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar The authors recognise that substantial attention has been paid to the human health consequences of ecosystem changes.2Myers SS Gaffikin L Golden CD et al.Human health impacts of ecosystem alteration.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2013; 110: 18753-18760Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 4Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller FoundationâLancet Commission on planetary Health.Lancet. 2015; 385: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1128) Google Scholar However, they point out that, by and large, previous scientific studies were focused on individual health consequences (eg, a specific infectious disease). Although this specificity is in some ways a virtue, it also limits the ability to draw broad conclusions about the net effects of habitat-destroying development projects on the overall health of local communities. Pienkowski and colleagues cast a much broader net: they analyse changes in diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, and fever in children, which are associated with the amount of local land set aside in protected areas, and with the destruction of local forests. Diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections decreased with increasing size of local protected areas, and all three childhood disease categories increased with the extent of local loss of dense forest. Pienkowski and colleagues reported that protected area coverage and deforestation had largely independent effects on the incidence of these childhood diseases. Thus, some of the protective effects of protected area coverage are not simply due to inhibition of deforestation, although these effects remain unexplained. The authors suggest that protected areas might stabilise land access, promote the provision of ecosystem services, increase local access to natural resources, or restrict exposure to zoonotic diseases by reducing humanâwildlife contact. Postulated mechanisms underlying the association between forest destruction and childhood diseases include compromised ability of degraded forests to regulate microbial contamination of surface and ground waters, leading to increases in diarrhoeal diseases, and smoke from biomass burning (which accompanies deforestation) exacerbating respiratory illnesses. As the authors recognise, a key limitation of their study is the absence of data directly related to the mechanisms underlying the statistical associations they identified. More broadly, Pienkowski and colleagues use observational and correlational approaches to draw inferences about causeâeffect relations between anthropogenic environmental changes and human health outcomes. With such approaches, which are commonplace in epidemiology and ecology, researchers need to provide safeguards to identify correlations between variables that could be spurious rather than causal. Two safeguards in this study particularly reduce the likelihood that the associations calculated are spurious. First, the authors incorporated what they considered to be an internal, negative control. Because they had no directional expectation about effects of deforestation or protected area coverage on the totality of non-specific illnesses and injury in the adult population, they included this response variable in the analyses. A finding that chronic illness and injury were correlated with deforestation or protected area coverage, without plausible causal linkages, would suggest spurious relations and cast doubt on the entire analysis. However, no such association was detected. The other safeguard was not emphasised by the authors, but could be quite important. The data for this study were collected between 2005 and 2014, a period during which deforestation in Cambodia increased substantially.5Forest TrendsConversion timber, forest monitoring, and land-use governance in Cambodia.http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/Cambodia%20Concessions%20Report%20small%20size.pdfGoogle Scholar During this period, Pienkowski and colleagues point out that \"national health outcomes improved with time\". At a national scale, therefore, one would expect a positive correlation between deforestation and overall human health, which would lead to the conclusion that deforestation improvesâand protected area coverage compromisesâhuman health. But the local-scale analyses paint an utterly different picture, which is made far more compelling by matching the scale of analysis to the scale of likely causal relations between environmental and human health variables. In a sense, then, the national correlations between environment and health act as a control for the local analyses. Protected areas are typically established to achieve conservation goals and are therefore ecocentric. Resistance to the establishment of protected areas can increase if the ecocentric goals are thought to conflict with anthropocentric goals. Pienkowski and colleagues' research is exciting because it shows that the benefits of protected areas might not be only ecocentric. If local human communities accrue important health gains from protection of natural habitats, perhaps the calculus of costs and benefits could change to accommodate mutual benefits for people and the environment. I declare no competing interests. Empirical evidence of the public health benefits of tropical forest conservation in Cambodia: a generalised linear mixed-effects model analysisDeforestation is associated with increased risk of several major sources of global childhood morbidity and mortality. Although causal mechanisms are unclear, our findings suggest that protected areas could help to alleviate the global health burden, presenting new possibilities for simultaneous achievement of public health and conservation goals.

Thus, the words âairâ, âpollutionâ, and even âsmokingâ are conspicuously absent from the WHO's 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata, a major milestone in the field of public health, which expressed âthe need for urgent actionâ¦to protect and promote the health of all the people of the worldâ.1International Conference on Primary Health CareDeclaration of Alma-Ata.WHO Chron. 1978; 32: 428-430PubMed Google Scholar Similarly, the United Nations (UN) Millennium Declaration of 2000 remained silent with regard to clean air.2General AssemblyResolution adopted by the General Assembly (A/res/55/2). United Nations Millenium Declaration.http://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.htmDate: 2000Google Scholar Since then, things have changed and the medical community has become more aware that the health of children greatly depends on breathing clean air. Thus, the 2015 UN resolution that defined the agenda for sustainable development recognises the adverse health effects caused by air pollution, which should be âsubstantially reducedâ by 2030.3General AssemblyResolution adopted by the General Assembly on 25 September 2015 (A/res/70/L.1). United Nations Sustainable Development Summit 2015. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform.https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/summitGoogle Scholar Air pollution now also features more prominently than before among the risk factors that determine the global burden of disease.4GBD 2015 Risk Factors CollaboratorsGlobal, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.Lancet. 2016; 388: 1659-1724Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar In particular, child mortality and morbidity in low-to-middle-income countries has been shown to be strongly associated with household air pollution caused by burning solid fuels (eg, coal, charcoal, wood, dung, and crop residues) for cooking and heating.5Gordon SB Bruce NG Grigg J et al.Respiratory risks from household air pollution in low and middle income countries.Lancet Respir Med. 2014; 2: 823-860Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar In The Lancet Planetary Health, Aneesa Vanker and colleagues7Vanker A Barnett W Workman L et al.Early-life exposure to indoor air pollution or tobacco smoke and lower respiratory tract illness and wheezing in African infants.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e238-e246Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar present findings from the Drakenstein Child Health Study,6Zar HJ Barnett W Myer L Stein D J Nicol MP Investigating the early-life determinants of illness in Africa: the Drakenstein Child Health Study.Thorax. 2015; 70: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar a birth cohort study in two poor peri-urban communities, some 60 km outside of Cape Town, South Africa. More than 1100 pregnant women were enrolled in this study between 2012 and 2015 to investigate the early-life determinants of illness in an African population. Vanker and colleagues7Vanker A Barnett W Workman L et al.Early-life exposure to indoor air pollution or tobacco smoke and lower respiratory tract illness and wheezing in African infants.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e238-e246Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar focus on the effect of antenatal and postnatal exposure to indoor air pollution on the occurrence and severity of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) or wheezing in children followed up until 1 year of age. A major strength of this unique study,7Vanker A Barnett W Workman L et al.Early-life exposure to indoor air pollution or tobacco smoke and lower respiratory tract illness and wheezing in African infants.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e238-e246Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar besides its remarkably low loss to follow-up, is the unusually thorough assessment of individual exposure. This assessment included urinary cotinine measurements to estimate active and passive smoking, and more than 4500 antenatal and postnatal home visits, with 24-h air sampling for particulate matter of diameter 10 Î¼m or less (PM10) and carbon monoxide, and 2 weeks' sampling of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds. In brief, the study mainly found increased risks of LRTI (incidence rate ratio 1Â·62, 95% CI 1Â·14â2Â·30; p=0Â·004) and of wheezing (2Â·09, 1Â·54â2Â·84; p<0Â·0001) if the mother smoked during pregnancy (depressingly, more than half of the mothers of mixed race smoked during pregnancy). High antenatal indoor exposure to fine dustâie, PM10 levels above 40 Î¼g/m3, the South African standard for ambient airâalso increased risk of LRTI (1Â·43, 1Â·06â1Â·95; p=0Â·008) but not of wheezing. Postnatal exposures were generally less associated with risks of LRTI or wheezing. The possible effect of traffic-related pollution was not reported. In a subanalysis among children with LRTI, antenatal exposure to toluene above 240 Î¼g/m3 was associated with significantly increased odds of hospitalisation (odds ratio 5Â·13, 95% CI 1Â·43â18Â·36; p=0Â·012) and requirement for oxygen (13Â·21, 1Â·96â89Â·16; p=0Â·008). An Australian case-control study8Rumchev K Spickett J Bulsara M Phillips M Stick S Association of domestic exposure to volatile organic compounds with asthma in young children.Thorax. 2004; 59: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar found increased risks of asthma in young children with increasing toluene and benzene concentrations in the home, but it is unlikely that, at the observed concentrations, toluene (and similar volatile organic compounds, such as benzene) are causally implicated in the observed respiratory effects. Nevertheless, volatile organic compounds probably represent good markers of combustion-related pollution and they can be measured fairly easily and cheaply by diffusive samplers,9Awopeju OF Nemery B Afolabi OT et al.Biomass smoke exposure as an occupational risk: cross-sectional study of respiratory health of women working as street cooks in Nigeria.Occup Environ Med. 2017; 74: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar as well as in urine.10Kicinski M Saenen ND Viaene MK et al.Urinary t, t-muconic acid as a proxy-biomarker of car exhaust and neurobehavioral performance in 15-year olds.Environ Res. 2016; 151: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar Another promising approach to assess exposure to combustion-related pollution is to measure carbon particles in urine.11Saenen ND BovÃ© H Steuwe C et al.Children's urinary environmental carbon load. A novel marker reflecting residential ambient air pollution exposure?.Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2017; 196: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar Our physical-chemical environment can be envisaged as a series of compartments that are imbricated like matryoshka dolls: the innermost doll is our internal milieu, the next compartment is the personal milieu (micro-environment), the next layers are the indoor environment (meso-environment) and the outdoor environment (macro-environment), and the final layer is the global or planetary environment. Obviously, all compartments communicate with each other. Hence, our internal milieu is polluted by substances absorbed from the external environment (and, sometimes, by chemicals released from prostheses, dental fillings, or tattoos). Importantly, during pregnancy the mother's internal milieu is also the external milieu of the fetus. Our personal micro-environment might be polluted by active smoking (so-called do-it-yourself air pollution), personal care products and cosmetics, and mobile phones, among other things. The meso-environment concerns the indoor spaces of homes, workplaces, and other buildings or vehicles, in which exposure to numerous types of pollutants can occur: cigarette smoke and other combustion products, substances released from building materials, household chemicals, and specific occupational agents. The outdoor environment is the one that people most often understand as the main environment to be affected by pollutants originating from industry, mining, power generation, agricultural activities, waste processing, urban traffic, among other things. In general, the concentrations of air pollutants are higher in indoor environments, especially if they are poorly ventilated, than in ambient urban air. Moreover, burning solid fuels or biomass causes not only indoor pollution, but also contributes substantially to ambient air pollution;12Chafe ZA Brauer M Klimont Z et al.Household cooking with solid fuels contributes to ambient PM2.5 pollution and the burden of disease.Environ Health Perspect. 2014; 122: 1314-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar however, this has not been thoroughly quantified for Africa. Conversely, pollutants emitted by industry or traffic also penetrate into homes or schools, depending on building characteristics. Finally, at the planetary level, our environment is influenced by natural phenomena and by human activities that lead to transboundary transport of pollutants and climate changes. The Drakenstein Child Health Study is undoubtedly a landmark study and its findings are likely to be generalisable to other vulnerable populations, although even poorer and more polluted populations live in rural areas and mega-cities in sub-Saharan Africa. What are the study's implications, so far, in terms of the prevention of LRTI? Vanker and colleagues' rightly advocate effective measures to prevent smoking by women and limiting exposure to indoor air pollution, especially during the antenatal period.7Vanker A Barnett W Workman L et al.Early-life exposure to indoor air pollution or tobacco smoke and lower respiratory tract illness and wheezing in African infants.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e238-e246Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar Indeed, as shown in their other articles,13Zar HJ Bacterial and viral pneumonia. New insights from the Drakenstein Child Health Study.Paediatr Respir Rev. 2017; 24: 8-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar even excellent medical interventions directed at individuals, such as a high rates of antipneumococcal immunisation and successful prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, are unlikely to reduce substantially the incidence of childhood pneumonias in low-to-middle-income countries. Structural interventions leading to decreased poverty and improved air quality are likely to be more effective. Citizens worldwide are entitled to clean air, just like clean water.14Brunekreef B Annesi-Maesano I Ayres JG et al.Ten principles for clean air.Eur Respir J. 2012; 39: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar We declare no competing interests.

    "ab": "In the days before Christmas, 1952, adverse weather conditions and the burning of sulphurous coal led to the death of almost 12 000 people in London. Despite improvements in pollution prevention since the âGreat Smogâ, London continues to experience toxic air pollution linked to thousands of premature deaths every year. In 2017, however, the main cause of pollution is nitrogen dioxide emitted by diesel vehicles and not the widespread burning of coal. And this time it is invisible. According to European Union regulations, nitrogen dioxide levels ought to only surpass 200 Î¼g/m3 of air during a 1 h period 18 times in a whole year, but by the beginning of January, London had already breached its annual air pollution limits. 15 other areas in the UK also breached legal limits for air pollution. Air pollution is linked to 40 000 deaths in UK each year, 9000 of which occur in London, costing the country almost Â£27Â·5 billion Most premature deaths from air pollution are caused by cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory disease; however it has broader effects on health. The effects of air pollution can be very severe on children because of their developing organs and immune systems. And living near congested, dirty roads increases the risk of heart and lung disease in both adults and children, as well as development of dementia in older people. A recent collaboration between The Guardian and Greenpeace showed that 3000 schools and nurseries across England and Wales are within 150 m of roads with high levels of nitrogen dioxide, putting hundreds of thousands of children at risk. But despite this obvious problem, the Government doesn't seem to apply strict rules to tackle air pollution. Twice in the pastâfirst in 2015 and then in November, 2016âplans to tackle air pollution were found to be illegal by the Supreme Court. To respond to the Court the Department for Transport must now present a new clean air plan by April 24. More than Â£2 billion has been committed since 2011 to cut emissions, but plans for clean air zones have only recently been set up and effective plans to tackle the emission of nitrogen dioxide are not yet in place, despite Â£290 million having been allocated to encourage use of electric vehicles, low emission vehicles, and alternative fuels. So what needs to be done? Most pollution in cities comes from road traffic and therefore from diesel vehicles that are responsible for most nitrogen dioxide emissions. Bringing the number of diesel cars in the centre of London down to 5% and increasing the number of cleaner alternatives should bring London into compliance with legal levels. âThe solution in the next 5 years or so is to reduce the number of diesel vehiclesâ, Jonathan Grigg tells The Lancet Planetary Health. But to embrace such radical change, people will need a support system. Any plan will have to be ambitious and realistic at the same time, it will need generous scrappage schemes to persuade drivers to give up on their diesel cars and swap to cleaner alternatives. A key challenge will be to encourage drivers of both personal and commercial vehicles to transition to hybrid and ultra-low-emission vehicles. Low emission zones that penalise drivers of polluting vehicles have been used in the past and might be useful again. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, has proposed a daily charge of Â£100 for non-complaint lorries and Â£12Â·50 for small complaint vehicles if they drive in the city. Urban planning will be vital. With a long term goal to meet air pollution limits set by the WHO and the European Union, public transportation will need to move towards sustainable solutions. Walking and cycling will need to be encouraged and, especially for the latter, safe. New roads tend to lead to new congestion and moreover reduce the available land for green spaces, which enhance air quality and should be a key part of urban development. Inevitably, exposure to air pollutants is beyond any one individual's control. Therefore, ministers need to tackle air pollution as a social as well as an environmental issue and public authorities need to act at regional, national, and international levels. Long-term policies and firm implementation of existing ones to reduce diesel use, encourage electric cars, and develop public transport systems, in tandem with better urban planning, will be crucial for an increasingly urbanised population. Such policies will require a continuous political support at both national and international levels, and policy makers should be held to account to ensure emission targets are met.",

In the past 3 decades, although millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, many poor sub-populations worldwide are mired in craters of inequality without opportunities.6Birdsall N Rising inequality in the new global economy. UN World Institute for Development Economics Research annual lecture.https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/rising-inequality-new-global-economyDate: 2005Google Scholar At the same time, many millions of people produce and consume far more than they need, and this overconsumption has been at enormous environmental and health cost. We are living in an unprecedented situation in which we are changing ecological dynamics and evolutionary processes more rapidly than ever, because of the number of human beings inhabiting the planet and the efficiency of our technological means. Harnessing opportunities to the benefit of humans without further undermining the ecosystem, other species, and our own health is a key element of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Although these goals set important targets in several dimensions of society, ecology, and economy, they also raise clearly conflicting agendas. As an example, continued economic growth remains elusive without environmental change and consumption of dwindling resources. This approach undermines the benefits people obtain from healthy ecosystems,7Hassan R Scholtes R Ash N Ecosystems and human well-being: current state and trends. volume 1.

With 23% of global deaths in 2012 attributed to unhealthy environments10PrÃ¼ss-UstÃ¼n A Wolf J CorvalÃ¡n C Bos R Neira M Preventing disease through healthy environments: a global assessment of the burden of disease from environmental risks. World Health Organization, Geneva2016Google Scholarâplus morbidity and mortality from zoonotic disease, antimicrobial resistance from injudicious medical and agricultural use, and toxicity of pesticides and other chemicalsâdisease prevention through enhanced environmental resilience is clearly warranted. Shifting from the current paradigm of ever growing resource-intensive responses will require deep, structural change far beyond the clinical dimension. The One Health, Ecohealth, Planetary Health, and related approaches support systems based and integrative efforts of multiple disciplines working to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment. They can also be instrumental in collating concerns and real risks from multiple stakeholders in the living and inert world, and above all, emphasise upstream prevention opportunities such as equitable trade, welfare oriented animal husbandry and sustainable land use that promote public health. The regional One Health Inter-ministerial meetings WHO recently held in collaboration with the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the UN Environmental Program (UNEP) are a strong step forward. These programmes are further strengthened by the Operational Framework for Good Governance by WHO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) at the human-animal interface, which supports countries to bridge WHO and OIE toolkits for the assessment of national capacities. However, funding mechanisms and incentives remain limited to support operationalising One Health. For example, although the Contingency Fund for Emergencies provides crucial response resources for public health emergencies, the future Director-General of WHO should also advocate for long-term capacity and infrastructure investments across the UN that ultimately provide incentive for intersectorial collaboration and promote disease prevention. The clear dominance of anthropogenic change on our planet has changed the requirements for governance and leadership. The leadership of WHO in the Anthropocene should reflect a holistic approach to health. In this respect, we expect the future Director-General to facilitate shifting the global health conversation from a solely health security narrative towards a narrative of mutual benefits for the whole planet. We would hope that they consider decisions that are detrimental for future generations as important as decisions made for the benefit of our generation. Now more than ever, WHO should have the forethought to constructively engage diverse stakeholders and broaden the agenda to address underlying drivers of diseaseâincluding predatory economy, landscape change, rapidly changing food systems, and climate change, among other pressures. It is imperative that we optimise development investments for the future. For this, the Director-General will rely on a cabinet that include diverse perspectives, ensuring a focus beyond solely human health security aims, and a balanced approach that respects the necessity of healthy animals and ecosystems. We expect the Director-General to show exceptional courage by incorporating the importance and immediacy of an integrated health approach for future generations.

Second, we did not inquire on the baseline survey (ie, before the disaster) about the frequency of social interactions between the survivors and the relatives or friends who were lost. In some instances, the frequency of social interactions might have been quite intense (eg, daily), in which case their loss could have contributed more to the risk of cognitive decline. Regarding potential gender differences, we fitted a three-way interaction term for housing damage Ã social capital Ã gender, and found that it was significant (p<0Â·001). In further gender-stratified analysis, we found that informal socialising and social participation appeared to significantly mitigate the effect of housing damage on cognitive decline in both sexes, but the effect was roughly twice as strong among women (coefficient â0Â·10, 95% CI â0Â·13 to â0Â·08, for females; coefficient â0Â·04, 95% CI â0Â·07 to â0Â·01, for males). Regarding changes in living arrangement after the disaster, we checked the effect of changes in cohabiting with children. A change in living arrangement (ie, not living with children pre-disaster and living with children post-disaster) was adversely associated with cognitive function in women (coefficient 0Â·08, 95% CI 0Â·01 to 0Â·16), but not in men (coefficient â0Â·01, 95% CI â0Â·08 to 0Â·06). However, we believe those association reflects simultaneity biasâie, changes in living arrangement triggered by a deterioration in cognitive function. The causal effect of changes in household composition might be difficult to identify because of this type of bias. The Iwanuma city area was fortunately not affected by the radiation fallout from the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster. Thus, most of the survivors chose to stay, or relocated within the same city after the disaster. Indeed, the census population was not significantly changed before versus after the disaster (44 187 in 2010 vs 44 704 in 2015). Even among our baseline respondents, only 92 people (approximately 2% of valid baseline respondents) moved out from Iwanuma city during the follow-up period (see also figure 2 in our paper1Hikichi H Tsuboya T Aida J et al.Social capital and cognitive decline in the aftermath of a natural disaster: a natural experiment from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e105-e113Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We agree with Dr Ozaki and colleagues that the availability of potential caregivers in the vicinity (eg, adult children) might have contributed to the cognitive resilience of survivors in the Iwanuma area. In our most recent paper,2Hikichi H Sawada Y Tsuboya T et al.Residential relocation and change in social capital: A natural experiment from the 2011 Japan Earthquake and Tsunami.Sci Adv. 2017; 3: e1700426Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar we examined the predictors of changes in social capital (informal socialising and social participation) in the aftermath of the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami, based on the same cohort sample. In that study, we found that changes in household composition (whether the individual was living alone or not) was not correlated with changes in social capital, using fixed effect models. We declare no competing interests. Social capital and cognitive decline in the aftermath of a natural disaster: a natural experiment from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and TsunamiImproved informal socialising and social participation reduces the risk of cognitive decline due to housing damage in the aftermath of natural disasters. Interventions to promote civic participation should be tried to promote cognitive resilience of older survivors.

In The Lancet Planetary Health, Jie Hu and colleagues4Hu J Xia W Pan X et al.Association of adverse birth outcomes with prenatal exposure to vanadium: a population-based cohort study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e230-e241Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar leveraged a population-based, prospective birth cohort in China to investigate the relationship between maternal exposure to metals during pregnancy and birth outcomes such as preterm delivery and low birthweight. Hu and colleagues reported greater odds of both preterm delivery and low birthweight with higher urinary concentrations of vanadium during the third trimester, even after adjusting for biomarkers of other metals associated with adverse birth outcomes. Health effects of vanadium have not been well-documented, particularly in terms of pregnancy and fetal health. However, the focus on vanadium is timely as research suggests that there is widespread contamination of soil by vanadium in parts of China due to mining and industrial activities.5Yang J Teng Y Wu J et al.Current status and associated human health risk of vanadium in soil in China.Chemosphere. 2017; 171: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar Additionally, this study raises many points of consideration for future studies aiming to characterise the effects of environmental exposures that result from anthropogenic emissions. Hu and colleagues examined the association between birth outcomes and biological markers of exposure to vanadium while considering the role of other metals as both confounders and effect modifiers. The consideration of how multiple exposures combine or interact to contribute to adverse health outcomes is of growing interest in the field of environmental health.6Taylor KW Joubert BR Braun JM et al.Statistical approaches for assessing health effects of environmental chemical mixtures in epidemiology: lessons from an innovative workshop.Environ Health Perspect. 2016; 124: A227-A229Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 7Carlin DJ Rider CV Woychik R Birnbaum LS Unraveling the health effects of environmental mixtures: an NIEHS priority.Environ Health Perspect. 2013; 121: A6-A8Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar Industrial processes, motor vehicle exhausts, and other anthropogenic activities emit multiple pollutants simultaneously. The effects of these mixtures and multiple exposures are not well characterised, because most studies examine pollutants individually.7Carlin DJ Rider CV Woychik R Birnbaum LS Unraveling the health effects of environmental mixtures: an NIEHS priority.Environ Health Perspect. 2013; 121: A6-A8Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar Hu and colleagues evaluated how other metals affected the relationship between vanadium and birth outcomes, identifying an interaction between vanadium and chromium.4Hu J Xia W Pan X et al.Association of adverse birth outcomes with prenatal exposure to vanadium: a population-based cohort study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e230-e241Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar They observed that women with high biological measures of both vanadium and chromium had eight-times higher odds of preterm delivery as women with low concentrations for both contaminants, whereas women with high concentrations of vanadium, but lower levels of chromium, had only two-times increased odds of preterm delivery. With many communities being simultaneously exposed to multiple contaminants, documenting the combined effects of environmental exposures is crucial for risk assessment.7Carlin DJ Rider CV Woychik R Birnbaum LS Unraveling the health effects of environmental mixtures: an NIEHS priority.Environ Health Perspect. 2013; 121: A6-A8Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar A growing number of approaches aim to identify health-relevant environmental mixtures within high-dimensional exposure data and estimate the collective effect of multiple exposures on the risk of adverse birth outcomes.6Taylor KW Joubert BR Braun JM et al.Statistical approaches for assessing health effects of environmental chemical mixtures in epidemiology: lessons from an innovative workshop.Environ Health Perspect. 2016; 124: A227-A229Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar Examples from the past 2 years have used machine learning techniques8Lenters V Portengen L Rignell-Hydbom A et al.Prenatal phthalate, perfluoroalkyl acid, and organochlorine exposures and term birth weight in three birth cohorts: multi-pollutant models based on elastic net regression.Environ Health Perspect. 2016; 124: 365-372PubMed Google Scholar and data-driven regression techniques9Govarts E Remy S Bruckers L et al.Combined effects of prenatal exposures to environmental chemicals on birth weight.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2016; 13: 495Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar to simultaneously assess the relationship between birth outcomes and several biological measures of exposure. The use of biological measures of exposure in this context can be regarded as a strength because the concentrations of several pollutants can be assessed simultaneously using a single sample. However, there are known limitations to prospective birth cohort studies that rely on biological markers of exposure that need to be considered. Due to the short time window between exposure assessment and outcome, there is the potential for biomarkers of exposure to be affected by the underlying pathology that contributes to the adverse birth outcome.10Savitz DA Invited commentary: interpreting associations between exposure biomarkers and pregnancy outcome.Am J Epidemiol. 2014; 179: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar Hu and colleagues partially guarded against this by excluding urine samples from emergency admissions for delivery. Future studies should also consider taking repeat biospecimens starting in early pregnancy, as suggested by Hu and colleagues. The availability of biological samples from multiple points during pregnancy would allow researchers to assess temporal variability during pregnancy and the potential role of underlying pathologies. Additionally, multiple measurements during pregnancy can aid in the identification of specific windows of vulnerability. Although necessary for designing successful interventions, pollutant source and route of exposure are not always known in studies using biological measures.10Savitz DA Invited commentary: interpreting associations between exposure biomarkers and pregnancy outcome.Am J Epidemiol. 2014; 179: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar Hu and colleagues acknowledge that the women in their study potentially had several routes of exposure to vanadium, including diet and ambient air. Additional research that aims to link anthropogenic sources with the biological markers of exposure that account for metabolism is needed for such findings to have an effect on public health policy. Studies that incorporate multiple domains of exposure, as well as intermediate measures of biological response, will allow for the exploration of pathways from external exposure to adverse birth outcomes, which could improve knowledge of causal relationships and identify potential targets for intervention.11Stingone JA Buck Louis GM Nakayama SF et al.Toward greater implementation of the exposome research paradigm within environmental epidemiology.Annu Rev Public Health. 2017; 38: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar Understanding the environmental contributors to adverse birth outcomes is crucial for reducing their incidence. Studies that build on the approach taken by Hu and colleagues and consider several pollutants, multiple time-windows, and the relationship between internal and external measures of exposure will advance our knowledge and inform prevention efforts.

Association of adverse birth outcomes with prenatal exposure to vanadium: a population-based cohort studyOur findings reveal a relationship between prenatal exposure to higher levels of vanadium and increased risk of adverse birth outcomes, suggesting that vanadium might be a potential toxic metal for human beings. Further studies are needed to replicate the observed associations and investigate the interaction effects of prenatal exposure to different metals on adverse birth outcomes.

We have three comments. First, 1329 (37%) of 3156 survivors in the study lost relatives and friends after the 2011 disaster, and were analysed conjointly. However, the risk of cognitive decline might have differed depending on who was lost among relatives and friends. For instance, loss of a spouse could be thought to have delivered a more detrimental effect on social capital than loss of friends. Second, although cognitive disability scores were adjusted for sex as a confounding factor, it is unclear whether gender differences in social capital affected the study results. Social capital and social networks might not have been evenly distributed between both genders, as a result of differing opportunities to invest in social capital between men and women, gender-specific socialisation processes, and differential societal expectations with regard to social networking.2Leeves GD Herbert R Gender differences in social capital investment: theory and evidence.Econ Model. 2014; 37: 377-385Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3Van Emmerik IIJH Gender differences in the creation of different types of social capital: a multilevel study.Soc Network. 2006; 28: 24-37Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar Particularly in a rural Japanese community, such as Iwanuma, the influence of gender differences might be amplified with the preservation of traditional gender roles. Additionally, it has been suggested that widowhood might be associated with increased mortality among Japanese men, but not Japanese women.4Ikeda A Iso H Toyoshima H et al.Marital status and mortality among Japanese men and women: the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study.BMC Public Health. 2017; 7: 73Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar As such, loss of a spouse might have had a different effect on physical and cognitive function depending on the gender of the surviving spouse. Finally, changes in household composition after the disaster were not considered. Our recent study suggested that cohabitant children might be a key source of social support among the elderly population in the coastal area of Fukushima, where levels of social capital could have significantly decreased because of a rapid population ageing and depopulation.5Ozaki A Nomura S Leppold C et al.Breast cancer patient delay in Fukushima, Japan following the 2011 triple disaster: a long-term retrospective study.BMC Cancer. 2017; 17: 423Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar Given that the distance between Iwanuma City and our study site is less than 30 km, the observed findings might also be applicable to the residents in the city, which would suggest that the existence of cohabitant children might have mitigated the decline of cognitive function among the elderly residents in the present study. We would be grateful if the authors could comment on these three points. We declare no competing interests. Social capital and cognitive decline in the aftermath of a natural disaster: a natural experiment from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and TsunamiImproved informal socialising and social participation reduces the risk of cognitive decline due to housing damage in the aftermath of natural disasters. Interventions to promote civic participation should be tried to promote cognitive resilience of older survivors. Full-Text PDF Open AccessSocial capital and cognitive decline after a natural disaster â Authors' replyWe thank Dr Ozaki and colleagues for their interest in our paper.1 Regarding loss of a loved one, we separately examined the effects of loss of relatives versus loss of friends on the decline in cognitive function. Neither type of loss was associated with cognitive decline. We note two limitations of our study. First, our survey asked about loss of âclose relativesâ in the disaster, and we could not distinguish between spouses and other close relatives (such as adult children). Second, we did not inquire on the baseline survey (ie, before the disaster) about the frequency of social interactions between the survivors and the relatives or friends who were lost.

People living in artificially cooled and heated environments might not be vulnerable to weather extremes because ambient temperature undoubtedly plays a partial direct role in explaining excess mortality. In such a volatile environment, with increasing urbanisation and uncontrolled mass immigration, as well as decreasing birth rates and increasing accumulation of older and vulnerable people, death almost inevitably might be triggered by other unpredictable factors,3Kinney Pl Schwartz J Pascal M et al.Winter season mortality: will climate warming bring benefits?.Environ Res Lett. 2015; 10: 064016Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar such as viral infections and other infectious diseases, disease transmission between individuals living in buildings with poor ventilation, indoor pollution, humidity, and crowding-related stress. As people often cannot avoid some of the most common outdoor activities, their lack of acclimatisation to ambient conditions renders these susceptible individuals at extreme risk even from moderate cold2Gasparrini A Guo Y Hashizume M et al.Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: a multicountry observational study.Lancet. 2015; 386: 369-375Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and from sudden changes in weather conditions and air quality. Mortality in indoor and built environments seems to be a rather unpredictable occurrence, as it is not possible to predict with certainty the future evolution of such a volatile climate in a warming world. The extreme uncertainty limits of mortality risk in artificial environmental conditions arise from potentially complex interactions between the rate of climate change and the underlying vulnerability of natural and artificial ecosystems.4IPCCClimate change 2014: synthesis report. Contribution of working groups I, II and III to the fifth assessment report of the IPCC. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Geneva2014Google Scholar Serious limitations exist when using past exposureâresponse functions to project future heat-related mortality rates, because it is inherently impossible to quantify the complex interaction of temperature with future socioeconomic, demographic, health, and lifestyle factors. Adaptation effectiveness is strongly dependent on global warming rates and radical changes in consumer behaviour patterns. Rapid economic and cultural globalisation is fundamentally incompatible with ecological sustainability on a finite planet. As climate change is a multifaceted international crisis, most people will be expected to support their own way of life. The global warming that we face is therefore not primarily an ecological crisis, but rather a cultural crisis. We declare no competing interests. Increasing risk over time of weather-related hazards to the European population: a data-driven prognostic studyGlobal warming could result in rapidly rising costs of weather-related hazards to human beings in Europe unless adequate adaptation measures are taken. Our results could aid in prioritisation of regional investments to address the unequal burden of effects on human beings of weather-related hazards and differences in adaptation capacities.

    "ab": "The vision presented by planetary health is one of holistic harmony of interdependent social, health, and environmental systems, which remain in peril. Whitmee and colleagues1Whitmee S Haines A Beyrer C et al.Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller FoundationâLancet Commission on planetary health.Lancet. 2015; 386: 1973-2028Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar identified that the challenges to realising this vision are pervasive and complex, and cannot be addressed independently of each other. Traditional approaches to leadership are increasingly poorly matched to the scope of problems that we face in a globalised world.2Gostin LO Friedman E Ebola: a crisis in global health leadership.Lancet. 2014; 384: 1323-1325Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar A new approach to leadership as a next generation comes of age is required to realise planetary health. Since 2009, Global Health Corps has trained more than 700 young global health leaders in east and southern Africa and the USA. Our 13-month fellowship programme places nearly 150 young leaders within health organisations to address crucial capacity gaps. We complement their workplace experience with a robust development curriculum on leadership. Our leaders have made substantial progress in their organisations and have the potential for more: 95% of our alumni remain in the global health or social justice field, with many moving into senior-level positions within 230 organisations in 35 countries. Several are currently directing their leadership efforts in service of the populations who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Over the past eight years, we have refined our approach to leadership development in response to the needs of our partner organisations and the growing complexity of global health challenges. This approach is built around four core methods, as follows, and is well placed to develop leaders for planetary health. First, a systems thinking approach addresses planetary health challenges by equipping leaders with the skills to understand and navigate complex challenges. This approach introduces new frameworks and points of reference from which leaders can better understand how social and political power affects the issues and perspectives that are prioritised.3de Savigny D Adam T for the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems ResearchWorld Health OrganizationSystems thinking for health systems strengthening. World Health Organization, Geneva2009Google Scholar A systems thinking method enables leaders to examine how institutions make decisions and to understand what pathways of influence exist and thereby challenge the beliefs, ideas, and assumptions that maintain the status quo. Second, a design thinking approach addresses planetary health challenges by supplying the tools for innovation and the creative mindset needed to reframe problems and provide new solutions.4Brown T Wyatt J Design thinking for social innovation.Development Outreach. 2010; 12: 29-43Crossref Google Scholar In a complex world with finite resources and substantial need, planetary health leaders require the skills to create targeted solutions that are responsive to feedback and can be scaled up quickly. Third, the Global Health Corps uses the term âauthentic leadershipâ to define the skills and attitudes that enable individuals to foster the personal resilience required to engage in work that effects long-term change to systems. Personal resilience is required to navigate a challenging social and political landscape that can be apathetic, or even hostile, to the sense of urgency that drives advocates of planetary health. Authentic leadership development focuses on the cultivation of a clear vision, a sense of purpose, and clarity on how the unique skills of each individual can be leveraged to contribute effectively to this work. Finally, there is growing recognition that leadership approaches that focus on the primacy of the individual are insufficient for the complex and monumental challenges posed by declining environmental and health trends.5World Health Organization. Open mindsets: participatory leadership for health. November 2016.Google Scholar In contrast, a collective leadership approach uses the power of networks. Progress toward planetary health requires an organised community of leaders who span sectoral, cultural, national, racial, and other boundaries, who engage in a regular exchange of ideas and resources, and who share a common vision, values, and priorities. To date, environmental and health challenges have been primarily approached through investment in policy and medical and technological interventions. Yet the pervasiveness and complexity of planetary health challenges requires a bolder intervention: exceptional leadership. Reversing the urgent decline in environmental trends and their related effects on human health will require an organised movement of leaders with the skills and attitudes that enable them to pursue effective solutions. Moreover, the young people of this generation and those generations to come have, perhaps, the most at stake in failing systems. It is crucial that we invest in young individuals and networks now to ensure the world's future health. JC, JM, and JG report grants from the Rockefeller Foundation.",

Most international research in this area focuses on cardiovascular events immediately after an earthquake, usually with up to 6 months of follow-up. This is the first longitudinal investigation (with 5 years of follow-up) of cardiovascular health outcomes after a natural hazard event. Research findings have established that the negative effects of earthquake-related stresses on cardiovascular outcomes continue for 12 months after the earthquakes. The study by Teng and colleagues uses a new cardiovascular stressor: level of property damage in area of residence, with damage defined as the ratio between the total value of building damage claims at an occupied dwelling and the property's value. The association between increased cardiovascular disease and level of property damage in an individual's area of residence has been developed by linking Canterbury District Health Board hospital admissions and mortality data with insurance-assessed damage on Christchurch housing stock. Population-wide information has been generated that could inform the development of early interventions to address post-earthquake stresses and enhance cardiac services. Findings from the Teng and colleagues' Article1Teng AM Blakely T Ivory V Kingham S Cameron V Living in areas with different levels of earthquake damage and risk of cardiovascular disease: a cohort-linkage study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e242-e253Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (18) Google Scholar could also be used to illustrate the principle of secondary surge capacity within the disaster medicine literature.

Access can be further restricted by the loss of medical facilities or their transfer to outside of the disaster zone, resulting in exacerbation of pre-existing medical conditions due to reduced continuity of care and delays in chronic disease management.3Runkle J Brock-Martin A Karmaus W Svenden E Secondary surge capacity: a framework for understanding long-term access to primary care for medically vulnerable populations in disaster recovery.Am J Public Health. 2012; 102: e24-e32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar Prior to a disaster, decisions made around planning for and funding an upsurge in demand for services for areas as diverse as cardiovascular disease,1Teng AM Blakely T Ivory V Kingham S Cameron V Living in areas with different levels of earthquake damage and risk of cardiovascular disease: a cohort-linkage study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e242-e253Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (18) Google Scholar mental health,1Teng AM Blakely T Ivory V Kingham S Cameron V Living in areas with different levels of earthquake damage and risk of cardiovascular disease: a cohort-linkage study.Lancet Planet Health. 2017; 1: e242-e253Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (18) Google Scholar and aged care4McMillan V More than 100 elderly die after quake relocation.

Further targeted research is therefore needed to investigate the effects of residing in areas with severely damaged homes on housing tenants, transitory residents, and homeless people. Research findings might potentially provide valuable in-depth information about health stresses associated with rent hikes, relocation challenges, and difficulties accessing essential health and social services, which could enhance planning for more effective health services in post-earthquake contexts.7Phibbs S Kenney C Severinsen C Mitchell J Hughes R Synergising public health concepts with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction: a conceptual glossary.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2016; 13: E1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar In addition to documenting and addressing challenges, such targeted research could highlight health protective factors, addressing a potential gap within the exiting health literature.

This is a surprising finding considering the higher rate of cardiovascular disease reported among MÄori people compared with the broader New Zealand population,8Cameron V Faatoese A Gillies M et al.A cohort study comparing cardiovascular risk factors in rural MÄori, urban MÄori and non-MÄori communities in New Zealand.BMJ. 2012; 2: e000799Google Scholar and the fact that most local MÄori resided in the lowest socioeconomic decile areas of Christchurch,9Statistics New ZealandMaori population of Christchurch City and New Zealand 2006 census.http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/AboutAPlace/SnapShot.aspx?id=2000060&type=ta&ParentID=10000133Date: 2014Google Scholar which were the suburbs that had the severest damage to housing.10Canterbury Earthquakes Royal CommissionInterim report. Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission, Christchurch2011Google Scholar The stable cardiovascular disease rate evidenced by the MÄori community at the time of the earthquakes suggests that cultural factors might mitigate cardiovascular health risks in times of adversity. Research11Kenney C Phibbs S A MÄori love story: community-led disaster management in response to the Åtautahi (Christchurch) earthquakes as a framework for action.Int J Disaster Risk Reduct. 2015; 14: 46-55Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar on factors that facilitated MÄori resilience following the Canterbury earthquakes identified key attributes such as kinship ties, cultural values, relational networks, and long-embedded adaptive capacity to natural hazards and the impacts of colonisation. We believe that future research investigating the health protective qualities of the aforementioned cultural attributes would be very valuable, particularly regarding the ways such attributes can be drawn on to mitigate cardiovascular risks for MÄori during times of housing uncertainty and more generally after major earthquakes. We declare no competing interests. Living in areas with different levels of earthquake damage and association with risk of cardiovascular disease: a cohort-linkage studyRates of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction were increased in people living in areas with more severely damaged homes in the first year after a major earthquake. Policy responses to reduce the effect of earthquake damage on cardiovascular disease could include pre-earthquake measures to minimise building damage, early wellbeing interventions within the first year to address post-earthquake stress, and enhanced provision of cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment services.

Planetary health has been defined as âthe health of human civilisation and the state of the natural systems on which it dependsâ. Planetary health research focuses on understanding and quantifying the human health effects of accelerating environmental change, including changes in climate, freshwater availability, biodiversity, food and nutrition, sustainable fishing, agricultural productivity, air quality, and water or airborne diseases. To catalyse innovative ideas among the disparate yet integrally related fields, The Lancet Planetary Health will publish a booklet of outstanding abstracts in planetary health research, in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the Planetary Health Alliance on May 29â31, 2018, at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. This publication will help to introduce readers to cutting-edge knowledge from a rapidly evolving transdisciplinary body of research that has profound implications for policy and practice across the sustainable development agenda. Researchers from any discipline relevant to planetary health are invited to submit an abstract of their research describing a recent study or a project currently in process that contributes to the gaps in knowledge, governance, and imagination as reported by the RockefellerâLancet Commission. In particular, we hope to have comprehensive submissions relating to the approaches, methods, tools, and indicators to assess how, where, and why environmental change leads to meaningful public health impacts. We are looking for geographically diverse examples of planetary health research and solutions, covering areas as diverse as the effects of climate change on human health; environmental change and food systems/human nutrition; land use change and vector-borne disease; urbanisation and mental health; zoonotic disease emergence; freshwater scarcity and communicable diseases; natural disasters and human displacement; and air quality impacts of deforestation. These are only a few of the many possible topics we welcome for submission. If you have any questions about whether the topic is relevant, please visit the Planetary Health Alliance website to see relevant themes or e-mail us at [email protected] Abstracts should be 400 words maximum in length and present detailed information on the design of the study, methods, and results, even if preliminary. Attention should be given to describing the impact of a change in the structure or function of a natural system(s) on a dimension (or dimensions) of human health. Abstracts should be written in English. Please lay out your abstract under the following headings: title (including a study descriptor if appropriateâeg, randomised), background (including context and aim), methods, findings, and interpretation. Abstracts should not contain references, tables, or figures. Please include the names, titles, highest degrees, and affiliations of all authors; postal and email addresses for the corresponding author; any funding received (if none, please state this); and a brief summary of the contributions of each author and any competing interests. Further editorial guidelines are available on The Lancet Planetary Health website. Reports of randomised trials should follow the CONSORT extension for abstracts. The abstract submission deadline is 1700 h EST (2200 h GMT) on Jan 5, 2018. Please submit your abstract at https://planetaryhealthannualmeeting.org. Notification of acceptance will be given by 1700 h EST on Feb 9, 2018. Authors of those abstracts accepted will be invited to present as oral or poster presenters at the 2018 Planetary Health Annual Meeting. A subset of accepted abstracts will also be included in the published booklet of the Best Abstracts in Planetary Health to be released at the Planetary Health Alliance Annual Meeting in May, 2018.

Not only would exiting the Paris climate accord harm human and planetary health, but also the Trump administration will miss the rising tide of innovation and transformation of the next industrial revolutionârenewable energy and zero-emission vehicles are among the best economic opportunities of our time. The good news from the USA is that several states (eg, California and Washington), cities, and companies are moving ahead with development and deployment of mitigation technology, incentivised by emission reduction goals and by commitment to moving towards sustainability. Further efforts could be made, including targeting of zero emission goals to take into account that the world will continue to warm for decades once carbon emissions stop; development of institutional support for work across government agencies (eg, public health, urban planning, transport, education and tourism), given that risks posed by climate change cut across sectors and regions; increasing of investment in research and technology development (eg, early warning and response systems for extreme weather events); and testing the efficacy and efficiency of implemented policies and programmes, to provide the evidence base for informed policy making. One motivation for these efforts is to promote and protect population health from the increasing risks of a changing climate. Weather and climate are negatively affecting population health at a global scale, with risks projected to increase with additional climate change.3IPCCClimate change 2014 synthesis reportâsummary for policymakers.

Cumulative greenhouse gases emissions will largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Scientific evidence for human-induced global warming is convincing. The fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that average temperatures are rising, precipitation patterns are changing, ice sheets are melting, sea levels are rising, and ocean acidification is worsening.3IPCCClimate change 2014 synthesis reportâsummary for policymakers. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, and New York, NY2014Google Scholar These changes are affecting the availability and quality of water supplies, how and where food is grown, and even all the components of ecosystems. Additional climate change is expected to increase the likelihood of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, and bushfires.3IPCCClimate change 2014 synthesis reportâsummary for policymakers.

Health effects arise from increases in heat-related mortality, infectious diseases, aeroallegens, air pollution, limited food and water supplies, mental illnesses related to floods and droughts, human and property losses caused by bushfires, and conflict and migration.7Guo Y Gasparrini A Armstrong B et al.Heatwave and mortality: a multi-country multi-community study.Environ Health Perspect. 2017; (published online Aug 14.)DOI:10.1289/EHP1026Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Tong S Confalonieri U Ebi K Olsen J Managing and mitigating the health risks of climate change: calling for evidence-informed policy and action.Environ Health Perspect. 2016; 124: A176-A179Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9McMichael C Barnett J McMichael AJ An ill wind?

World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2014Google Scholar It will be important to estimate the direct effects of climate change on temperature-related mortality and morbidity. A 2017 international study found that heatwaves significantly increased mortality across all countries studied, but the magnitude of the impacts varied with region and exposure intensity.7Guo Y Gasparrini A Armstrong B et al.Heatwave and mortality: a multi-country multi-community study.Environ Health Perspect. 2017; (published online Aug 14.)DOI:10.1289/EHP1026Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar As climate change will increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves, health authorities need to prepare for the increased burden of heat-related mortality. Another important area of research is to project the future risks of malaria and other diseases associated with climate change to support effective policy making and intervention activity. Accruing evidence converges on a single point: the direct effect of climate change on future malaria transmission results in an increase of the simulated length of the malaria transmission season over the tropical highlands.8Tong S Confalonieri U Ebi K Olsen J Managing and mitigating the health risks of climate change: calling for evidence-informed policy and action.Environ Health Perspect. 2016; 124: A176-A179Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar Climate change will likely expand the distribution of disease vectors to non-endemic areas, increase the length of the disease-transmission season, and facilitate hostâvectorâenvironment interactions in many regions. Additionally, climate change is projected to cause substantial increases in population movement in coming decades. Climate-change-related migration is likely to result in adverse health outcomes, both for displaced and for host populations, particularly in situations of forced migration.9McMichael C Barnett J McMichael AJ An ill wind? Climate change, migration, and health.Environ Health Perspect. 2012; 120: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar WHO concluded that climate change is expected to cause about 250 000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050; of these, 38 000 will be due to heat exposure among the elderly, 48 000 to diarrhoeal disease, 60 000 to malaria, and 95 000 to undernourishment in children.12WHOQuantitative risk assessment of the effects of climate change on selected causes of death, 2030s and 2050s. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2014Google Scholar Although these risk estimates are uncertain due to the low number of studies on the health impacts of climate change, particularly from low-income countries, they are broadly indicative of substantial public health consequences of climate change. The medical community has been at the forefront of research evaluating the impacts of climate change on population health and promoting mitigation strategies. We need to promote the concept of global stewardship and strengthen our collaboration with other sectors and disciplines to actively facilitate and develop policies (including the effective implementation of the Paris accord) that will reduce and prevent the devastating consequences of climate change. Health research and economic development can work together to ensure that all human beings and our children live in a healthy and sustainable planet. We declare no competing interests.",

Although only a few health-care advocates and political leaders understand the underlying science well enough to evaluate climate-related proposals with respect to their impact on allergic diseases in children,11Pidgeon N Fischhoff B The role of social and decision sciences in communicating uncertain climate risks.Nat Clim Change. 2011; 1: 35-41Crossref Scopus (414) Google Scholar we believe that the Lancet Commission should unite researchers, paediatricians, allergy specialists, climatologists, policy makers, and public health professionals not only in the UK, but worldwide. This unity will likely result in establishment of policies to decrease the incidence of allergies in children in the UK, and possibly set a precedent for other countries to do likewise.

    "ab": "During the past four decades the difference between two American presidential administrations has never been so striking. Aside from access to affordable health care, no single issue splits the administrations wider than their approaches to climate change. On Aug 3, 2015, during Barak Obama's presidency, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a series of state-level standards and rules to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants known as the Clean Power Plan, developed under the auspices of the Clean Air Act. On Oct 10, 2017, Donald Trump's administration announced its intention to revoke Obama's plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. To fulfil its promise to cut emissions as part of the Paris Agreement, the plan set up under Obama was designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to below 32% of 2005 levels by 2030. Getting rid of the Clean Power Plan will mark the end of the Obama's environmental legacy to tackle climate change and begin a new era for the USA wherein the EPA will set up new goals and emissions targets, and new ways to reach them, to regulate toxic pollution from existing power plants. Does this change mark the rise of the coal industry again? In 2016, about 4Â·08 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity were generated in the USA. 30% of this electricity was generated from coal. However, the US electricity sector has been going through a transitional period as coal has given way to natural gas and to newer, cleaner technologies. The share of US electricity coming from coal fell unprecedentedly from 51% in 2008 to 30% in 2016. According to a report on coal from the Union of Concerned Scientists, many coal power plants are closing; between 2008 and 2017 almost 17% of the coal capacity in the USA was retired, and one in four plants are converting to natural gas. The transition away from coal is not yet over, but progress is being made. Many utility companies have already opted to move away from coal towards natural gas, wind, and solar power driven by affordable costs and the profitable clean (and green) energy market. In March, 2017, for the first time, wind and solar sources accounted for 10% of all electricity generation. In 2016, solar and wind industries were the primary engines of job creation in the US renewable energy sector, which employed almost 777 000 people. Favourable policies, declining technological costs, and incentivesâsuch as establishment of strong renewable energy portfolio standardsâwill be needed to continue to bring the cost for renewable-based electricity below the price of electricity from fossil fuels. Reduced costs and a functional marketplace will afford individuals, households, and communities more control over where they choose to get their energy. In Nevada, for example solar electricity is sold at a rate of $0Â·3 per kWh, which is similar to the price of the electricity produced by fossil fuels. Investing in renewable energy will produce a great public health benefit and also has the potential to replace fossil fuel sources for the production of energy. In a 2017 article by Possner and colleagues, it was calculated that a wind farm in the middle of the North Atlantic during the winter times could provide enough energy to meet the entire global electricity demand. The Trump administration may wish to halt the inevitable decline of coal, but the absence of a replacement plan and the low cost of renewable energy make this aim unrealistic. Obama's plan to cut carbon dioxide emission was controversial to many as the Clean Power Plan set targets for coal power planets assuming states could build more renewables and shut coal plants. However, this approach was different from how the EPA normally does things. For example, when it sets standards for power plants it usually only looks at actions that could be undertaken at the plants themselves. Obama's plan to cut emissions from power plants was one of the strongest actions taken to fight climate change in USA. Analysts have in fact suggested that, thanks to the low cost of renewables, the target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions to below 32% of the 2005 levels by 2030 will be met despite the repeal. Moving away from the coal era is imperative and inevitable. All investments should continue to support cleaner and greener technologies that will protect not only the planet but will also contribute to building a healthy economy that will sustainably support current and future generations.",
