31763225,10.1007/s12070-015-0931-7,Evaluation of Association of Allergic Rhinitis with Bronchial Asthma.,"Allergic rhinitis represents a global health problem. It is a common disease worldwide affecting about 10-50 % of the population and its prevalence is increasing. Although allergic rhinitis is not a fatal disease, it alters the social life of patients, affecting learning performance and work productivity. Moreover, the costs incurred by allergic rhinitis are substantial. In recent years allergic rhinitis has been recognized to be an important risk factor for asthma. The concept of ""One Airway, One Disease"" was highlighted in the 'Allergic rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma 'guidelines and has arisen as a result of the now well-established link between the upper and lower airways. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma by determining the incidence of bronchial asthma in patients of allergic rhinitis and the incidence of allergic rhinitis in patients of bronchial asthma. 83 diagnosed cases each of allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma were recruited from patients attending Otorhinolaryngology and pulmonary department of the institute. All patients were subjected to detail ENT and pulmonary examination and investigated for nasal and bronchial allergy. In the allergic group, which consisted of 83 diagnosed patients of allergic rhinitis, 49 (59.03 %) were diagnosed to have bronchial asthma, whereas in the bronchial asthma group, which consisted of 83 diagnosed patients of bronchial asthma 61 (78.20 %) were diagnosed to have comorbid allergic rhinitis. It was observed that patients with allergic rhinitis were likely to develop bronchial asthma, and patients of allergic rhinitis should be evaluated for bronchial asthma, for early detection and treatment of the co morbid condition.",eng,Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2019

Current treatments are either ineffective, or associated with unwanted side-effects. The development of effective, safe therapies requires the identification of novel therapeutic targets using clinically relevant animal models of neuropathic pain. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα), is a member of the nuclear hormone family of transcription factors, which is widely distributed in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Pharmacological studies report antinociceptive effects of PPARα agonists following systemic administration in rodent models of neuropathic pain, however the neuronal mechanisms and sites of action mediating these effects are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of systemic administration of the synthetic PPARα agonist, WY-14643 on mechanically-evoked responses of spinal cord dorsal horn wide dynamic range (WDR) neurones in the spinal nerve ligated (SNL) model of neuropathic pain in rats. In addition, comparative molecular analysis of mRNA coding for PPARα and PPARα protein expression in the spinal cord of sham-operated and neuropathic rats was performed. Methods Lumbar L5-L6 spinal nerve ligation was performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats (110-130 g) under isoflurane anaesthesia. Sham controls underwent similar surgical conditions, but without ligation of the L5-L6 spinal nerves. Hindpaw withdrawal thresholds were measured on the day of surgery -day 0, and on days- 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 post-surgery. At day 14 extracellular single-unit recordings of spinal (WDR) dorsal horn neurons were performed in both sham and SNL neuropathic rats under anaesthesia. The effects of intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of WY-14643 (15 and 30 mg/kg) or vehicle on evoked responses of WDR neurons to punctate mechanical stimulation of the peripheral receptive field of varying bending force (8-60 g) were recorded. In a separate cohort of SNL and sham neuropathic rats, the expression of mRNA coding for PPARα and protein expression in the ipsilateral and contralateral spinal cord was determined using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting techniques respectively. Results WY-14643 (15 and 30mg/kg i.p.) rapidly attenuated mechanically evoked (8, 10 and 15g) responses of spinal WDR neurones in SNL, but not sham-operated rats. Molecular analysis revealed significantly increased PPARα protein, but not mRNA, expression in the ipsilateral spinal cord of SNL, compared to the contralateral side in SNL rats. There were no changes in PPARα mRNA or protein expression in the sham controls. Conclusion The observation that levels of PPARα protein were increased in ipsilateral spinal cord of neuropathic rats supports a contribution of spinal sites of action mediating the effects of systemic WY-14643. Our data suggests that the inhibitory effects of a PPARα agonist on spinal neuronal responses may account, at least in part, for their analgesic effects of in neuropathic pain. Implication Selective activation of PPARα in the spinal cord may be therapeutically relevant for the treatment of neuropathic pain.",eng,Scandinavian journal of pain,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
28042284,10.1002/pa.1584,Assessing the Impact of Stricter Alcohol Advertising Standards: The Case of Beam Global Spirits.,"Reducing youth exposure to alcohol advertising is a global health priority. In most countries around the world, the alcohol industry is given the opportunity to regulate itself with respect to advertising practices. Generally, the alcohol industry self-regulations are lax, allowing youth to be disproportionately exposed to alcohol advertising. However, Beam Global Spirits and Wine (Beam) voluntarily adopted more restrictive advertising standards in the United States in 2007. This study assessed Beam's compliance with their new standard and estimates its effect on youth exposure and advertising costs. We found that Beam's compliance with its more restrictive standards was imperfect, but never-the-less, we estimated that youth exposure to alcohol advertising was reduced compared to other spirits brands. Beam's more restrictive standards did not increase their advertising costs and therefore other alcohol companies should consider adopting similar standards around the world.",eng,Journal of public affairs,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Although the relationship between obesity and T2DM is well established, the common molecular pathomechanisms are still under investigation. Recently, it has been suggested that epigenetic modifications may be involved in both obesity and T2DM development. Epigenetics plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by the reversible modifications of chromatin structure without any changes in DNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, posttranslational histone modifications and miRNA interference. Therefore, the aim of this article is to discuss the current knowledge on epigenetic modifications in adipose tissue and their association with obesity and T2DM.",eng,Archives of medical science : AMS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27842865,10.1016/j.jgar.2015.08.004,Monitoring the efficacy of drugs for neglected tropical diseases controlled by preventive chemotherapy.,"In the last decade, pharmaceutical companies, governments and global health organisations under the leadership of the World Health Organization (WHO) have pledged large-scale donations of anthelmintic drugs, including ivermectin (IVM), praziquantel (PZQ), albendazole (ALB) and mebendazole (MEB). This worldwide scale-up in drug donations calls for strong monitoring systems to detect any changes in anthelmintic drug efficacy. This review reports on the outcome of the WHO Global Working Group on Monitoring of Neglected Tropical Diseases Drug Efficacy, which consists of three subgroups: (i) soil-transmitted helminthiases (ALB and MEB); (ii) onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (IVM); and (iii) schistosomiasis (PZQ). Progress of ongoing work, challenges and research needs for each of the four main drugs used in helminthic preventive chemotherapy (PC) are reported, laying the ground for appropriate implementation of drug efficacy monitoring programmes under the co-ordination and guidelines of the WHO. Best practices for monitoring drug efficacy should be made available and capacity built as an integral part of neglected tropical disease (NTD) programme monitoring. Development of a disease-specific model to predict the impact of PC programmes, to detect outliers and to solicit responses is essential. Research studies on genetic polymorphisms in relation to low-efficacy phenotypes should be carried out to identify markers of putative resistance against all NTD drugs and ultimately to develop diagnostic assays. Development of combination and co-administration of NTD drugs as well as of new drug entities to boost the armamentarium of the few drugs available for NTD control and elimination should be pursued in parallel.",eng,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,Review,2025-04-23,2015

Eleven independent case-control studies were ultimately selected for the current meta-analysis, comprising a total of 1527 HBV cases and 1467 healthy subjects.--NEW SECTION--The results in the current meta-analysis showed that carriers of the IFN-γ A allele were more likely to develop HBV infection than those without in all five genetic models (all p < 0.05). According to the ethnicity-based sub-group analysis, a significant difference of the IFN-γ rs2430561 T > A polymorphism was detected associated with the increased risk of HBV infection in Asians and European-derived populations in the majority of the groups.--NEW SECTION--The results implicate a possible relationship between the IFN-γ rs2430561 T > A polymorphism and the risk of HBV infection. Therefore, IFN-γ genetic polymorphisms might be important in determining an individual's susceptibility to HBV infection.",eng,Annals of human biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The success, failure and trends in domestic litigation used by tobacco companies to undermine tobacco control are not well understood, with commentators often assuming disputes are trade related or international in nature. We analyse domestic legal disputes involving tobacco companies and public health actors in high-income countries across the last decade to ascertain the types of action and the success or failure of cases, develop effective responses.--NEW SECTION--WorldLii, a publicly available online law repository, was used to identify domestic court cases involving tobacco companies from 2004 to 2014, while outcome data from LexisNexis and Westlaw databases were used to identify appeals and trace case history.--NEW SECTION--We identified six domestic cases in the UK, Australia and Canada, noting that the tobacco industry won only one of six cases; a win later usurped by legislative reform and a further court case. Nevertheless, we found cases involve significant resource costs for governments, often progressing across multiple jurisdictional levels.--NEW SECTION--We suggest that, in light of our results, while litigation takes up significant time and incurs legal costs for health ministries, policymakers must robustly fend off suggestions that litigation wastes taxpayers' money, pointing to the good prospects of winning such legal battles.",eng,"Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Questions elicited background information on each programme and inquired about curriculum and methods used for teaching oral cancer prevention and early detection.--NEW SECTION--Eight of the 12 (67%) programmes responded. Three (37.5%) reported having a specific oral cancer curriculum. Five (62.5%) require students to perform examinations for signs and symptoms of oral cancer at each clinic visit. Variations exist across the programmes in the number of patients each student sees annually and the number of oral cancer examinations each student performs before graduation. Seven programmes (87.5%) conduct early detection screening in community settings. All programmes included risk assessment associated with tobacco. All other risk factors measured were treated inconsistently.--NEW SECTION--Significant differences in training and experience were reported across Illinois dental hygiene programmes. Training is neither standardized nor uniformly comprehensive. Students' preparation for delivering prevention and early detection services to their patients could be strengthened to ensure competence including reflection of risk factors and behaviours in a global context. Regular review of curricular guidelines and programme content would help dental hygienists meet the expectations of the Crete Declaration on Oral Cancer Prevention.,eng,International journal of dental hygiene,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27731839,10.2196/mededu.4443,Design of Mobile Augmented Reality in Health Care Education: A Theory-Driven Framework.,"Augmented reality (AR) is increasingly used across a range of subject areas in health care education as health care settings partner to bridge the gap between knowledge and practice. As the first contact with patients, general practitioners (GPs) are important in the battle against a global health threat, the spread of antibiotic resistance. AR has potential as a practical tool for GPs to combine learning and practice in the rational use of antibiotics.--NEW SECTION--This paper was driven by learning theory to develop a mobile augmented reality education (MARE) design framework. The primary goal of the framework is to guide the development of AR educational apps. This study focuses on (1) identifying suitable learning theories for guiding the design of AR education apps, (2) integrating learning outcomes and learning theories to support health care education through AR, and (3) applying the design framework in the context of improving GPs' rational use of antibiotics.--NEW SECTION--The design framework was first constructed with the conceptual framework analysis method. Data were collected from multidisciplinary publications and reference materials and were analyzed with directed content analysis to identify key concepts and their relationships. Then the design framework was applied to a health care educational challenge.--NEW SECTION--The proposed MARE framework consists of three hierarchical layers: the foundation, function, and outcome layers. Three learning theories-situated, experiential, and transformative learning-provide foundational support based on differing views of the relationships among learning, practice, and the environment. The function layer depends upon the learners' personal paradigms and indicates how health care learning could be achieved with MARE. The outcome layer analyzes different learning abilities, from knowledge to the practice level, to clarify learning objectives and expectations and to avoid teaching pitched at the wrong level. Suggestions for learning activities and the requirements of the learning environment form the foundation for AR to fill the gap between learning outcomes and medical learners' personal paradigms. With the design framework, the expected rational use of antibiotics by GPs is described and is easy to execute and evaluate. The comparison of specific expected abilities with the GP personal paradigm helps solidify the GP practical learning objectives and helps design the learning environment and activities. The learning environment and activities were supported by learning theories.--NEW SECTION--This paper describes a framework for guiding the design, development, and application of mobile AR for medical education in the health care setting. The framework is theory driven with an understanding of the characteristics of AR and specific medical disciplines toward helping medical education improve professional development from knowledge to practice. Future research will use the framework as a guide for developing AR apps in practice to validate and improve the design framework.",eng,JMIR medical education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
27623316,10.1021/acsinfecdis.5b00081,A Novel Sterol Isolated from a Plant Used by Mayan Traditional Healers Is Effective in Treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis Caused by Leishmania donovani.,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, is a global health problem affecting millions of people worldwide. Treatment of VL largely depends on therapeutic drugs such as pentavalent antimonials, amphotericin B, and others, which have major drawbacks due to drug resistance, toxicity, and high cost. In this study, for the first time, we have successfully demonstrated the synthesis and antileishmanial activity of the novel sterol pentalinonsterol (PEN), which occurs naturally in the root of a Mexican medicinal plant, Pentalinon andrieuxii. In the experimental BALB/c mouse model of VL induced by infection with L. donovani, intravenous treatment with liposome-encapsulated PEN (2.5 mg/kg) led to a significant reduction in parasite burden in the liver and spleen. Furthermore, infected mice treated with liposomal PEN showed a strong host-protective TH1 immune response characterized by IFN-γ production and formation of matured hepatic granulomas. These results indicate that PEN could be developed as a novel drug against VL.",eng,ACS infectious diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
27623313,10.1021/acsinfecdis.5b00056,Lysine-Based Small Molecules That Disrupt Biofilms and Kill both Actively Growing Planktonic and Nondividing Stationary Phase Bacteria.,"The emergence of bacterial resistance is a major threat to global health. Alongside this issue, formation of bacterial biofilms is another cause of concern because most antibiotics are ineffective against these recalcitrant microbial communities. Ideal future antibacterial therapeutics should possess both antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities. In this study we engineered lysine-based small molecules, which showed not only commendable broad-spectrum antibacterial activity but also potent biofilm-disrupting properties. Synthesis of these lipophilic lysine-norspermidine conjugates was achieved in three simple reaction steps, and the resultant molecules displayed potent antibacterial activity against various Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) including drug-resistant superbugs MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), VRE (vancomycin-resistant E. faecium), and β-lactam-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. An optimized compound in the series showed activity against planktonic bacteria in the concentration range of 3-10 μg/mL, and bactericidal activity against stationary phase S. aureus was observed within an hour. The compound also displayed about 120-fold selectivity toward both classes of bacteria (S. aureus and E. coli) over human erythrocytes. This rapidly bactericidal compound primarily acts on bacteria by causing significant membrane depolarization and K(+) leakage. Most importantly, the compound disrupted preformed biofilms of S. aureus and did not trigger bacterial resistance. Therefore, this class of compounds has high potential to be developed as future antibacterial drugs for treating infections caused by planktonic bacteria as well as bacterial biofilms.",eng,ACS infectious diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The first global health treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), outlines a set of policy initiatives that have been demonstrated as effective in reducing tobacco use. Article 11 of the FCTC focuses on using the tobacco package to communicate tobacco-caused harms; it also seeks to restrict the delivery of misleading information about the product on the pack.--NEW SECTION--The objective of this study was to establish a surveillance system for tobacco packs in the 14 low- and middle-income countries with the greatest number of smokers. The Tobacco Pack Surveillance System (TPackSS) monitors whether required health warnings on tobacco packages are being implemented as intended, and identifies pack designs and appeals that might violate or detract from the communication of harm-related information and undermine the impact of a country's tobacco packaging laws. The protocol outlined is intended to be applicable or adaptable for surveillance efforts in other countries.--NEW SECTION--Tobacco packs were collected in 14 countries during 2013. The intention was, to the extent possible, to construct a census of ""unique"" pack presentations available for purchase in each country. The TPackSS team partnered with in-country field staff to implement a standardized protocol for acquiring packs from 36 diverse neighborhoods across three cities in each country. At the time of purchase, data on price and place of acquisition of each pack was recorded. The field staff, according to a standardized protocol, then photographed packs before they were shipped to the United States for coding and archiving.--NEW SECTION--Each pack was coded for compliance with the country-specific health warning label laws, as well as for key design features of the pack and appeals of the branding elements.

Difference in response to antihypertensive medication depending on ethnic group is well recognized. There is very few data regarding this difference in the South Asian population especially from Nepal. Objective The aim of this study is to find out which antihypertensive medication has better efficacy in our population. Method One seventy two newly diagnosed hypertensive patients who presented to cardiology OPD were included. Blood Pressure (BP) was recorded in both arms at least three times. Patients were counseled for lifestyle and dietary modification and were prescribed one of the three drugs Hydrochlorthiazide 25 mg or Amlodipine 5 mg or Enalapril 5 mg. Patients were called back in 4-6 weeks time and Blood Pressure was recorded in similar manner. Result Out of 172 patients, 97 were male and 75 female. The mean age was 55.49±1.03 years. Mean Systolic BP before treatment was 156.2±10.6 mm of Hg and Mean Diastolic BP before treatment was 100.5 ±6.8 with no statistically significant difference among different groups. However Systolic BP reduction was 14.6 ±5.1, 21.9±5.9 and 21.8±7.4 by Hydrochlorthiazide , Amlodipine and Enalapril respectively. Diastolic BP reduction was 8.8±2.5, 14.2±2.8 and 14.3±2.9 by Hydrochlorthiazide, Amlodipine and Enalapril respectively. Conclusion Amlodipine and Enalapril are equally effective in controlling BP in our population. Hydrochlorthiazide is less effective than both Amlodipine and Enalapril.",eng,Kathmandu University medical journal (KUMJ),Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

Student opinions were gathered from anonymous course evaluations. Student outcome data and graduates' perspectives were gathered through a voluntary, anonymous, online survey. We reflect on student demand, program strengths and weaknesses, and future academic directions.--NEW SECTION--The program's structure arose from three learning objectives identified by the Curriculum Committee: a multidisciplinary approach to the foundations of global health, an emphasis on research design and methods, and an application of theory to international fieldwork. The resulting broad curriculum has attracted students of diverse backgrounds, which has enriched classroom discussions. Over the first 5 years, the program revised its fieldwork project criteria to allow more flexibility in design, leading to a higher rate of publication and enabling students to graduate with an academic portfolio. Students have reported that the high faculty-to-student ratio has fostered strong mentorship relationships; this is vital as 66% of graduates work in academics. Graduates have reflected that group work in the program appropriately prepared them for their work environment. The program's experience has guided its response to: pressure to focus on medical aspects of global health; students' needs for career skill-building; financial challenges; and trends toward online didactics.--NEW SECTION--The recent surge in interest in global health careers has created demand for academic programs. UCSF has designed the MS degree program to balance breadth and depth of learning in a multidisciplinary curriculum, and combine career preparation and theoretical learning in a one-year academic degree. The challenges of balancing breadth and depth of learning in a multidisciplinary program, and combining career preparation and theoretical learning in a one-year academic degree, have informed UCSF's MS program design.",eng,Annals of global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, evaluations of these programs are limited.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this study was to evaluate a field placement program at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, to understand how to better support student training overseas and faculty mentorship.--NEW SECTION--We used qualitative and quantitative methods to gather data from program reporting requirements (152 student surveys and 46 experiential narrative essays), followed by 17 semistructured interviews, and 2 focus groups. Data were analyzed through manual coding and a socioecological model served as an analytical and a synthesizing framework.--NEW SECTION--A series of factors influence the participants' experience in overseas placements spanning across 4 aggregate levels, from individual to societal, including opportunity for professional advancement, independence, loneliness and illness, mentorship quality, funding, institutional partnership building, opportunity for public health contribution, and for development of cultural competency. Faculty and students thought that the program was beneficial to the learning experience, particularly for its contribution to experiential knowledge of a low- and middle-income country setting and for developing cross-cultural relationships. Communication and scope of work were 2 areas in which students and faculty members often had different expectations and many students emerged having cultivated different skills than they or their mentor initially expected. Students found the experience useful for both their academic and professional careers and faculty members saw mentorship, one of their professional responsibilities, emerge.--NEW SECTION--Many socioecological factors influence an overseas field experience, which in turn produces important effects on students' career choices, and faculty members appreciate the opportunity to serve as mentors.

In most populations, the main source of arsenic exposure is the drinking water. In drinking water, chronic exposure to arsenic is associated with increased risks of various cancers including those of skin, lung, bladder, and liver, as well as numerous other non-cancer diseases including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neurologic and cognitive problems. Recent emerging evidences suggest that arsenic exposure affects the reproductive and developmental toxicity. Prenatal exposure to inorganic arsenic causes adverse pregnancy outcomes and children's health problems. Some epidemiological studies have reported that arsenic exposure induces premature delivery, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth. In animal studies, inorganic arsenic also causes fetal malformation, growth retardation, and fetal death. These toxic effects depend on dose, route and gestation periods of arsenic exposure. In males, inorganic arsenic causes reproductive dysfunctions including reductions of the testis weights, accessory sex organs weights, and epididymal sperm counts. In addition, inorganic arsenic exposure also induces alterations of spermatogenesis, reductions of testosterone and gonadotrophins, and disruptions of steroidogenesis. However, the reproductive and developmental problems following arsenic exposure are poorly understood, and the molecular mechanism of arsenic-induced reproductive toxicity remains unclear. Thus, we further investigated several possible mechanisms underlying arsenic-induced reproductive toxicity.",eng,Development & reproduction,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Gelatine is commonly used as a matrix to suspend analogues and mimic tissue, but other substrates like ground meat can also be used. Both of these substrates require refrigeration and are subject to spoiling. Our research was designed to evaluate whether agar models would be superior to traditional Gelatine models in their sustainability and whether they would produce ultrasound images adequate for training.--NEW SECTION--Agar models of varying formulas (percent agar by weight with certain additives varied) were tested for acceptable fidelity to real tissue, ultrasound image quality, and durability compared to gelatine models and human tissue.--NEW SECTION--A five percent by-mass agar model augmented with small amounts of suspended wheat flour presented as a model that could generate an ultrasound image that remarkably resembled that of real tissue. This agar model does not require refrigeration, is resistant to spoiling and desiccation, mimics tissue texture well, is durable enough to withstand high-volume training, and can be recycled to make new models.--NEW SECTION--Agar phantoms are easy to make, do not require refrigeration, and have multiple distinct advantages over gelatine models for ultrasound training in austere conditions.",eng,African journal of emergency medicine : Revue africaine de la medecine d'urgence,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The search was limited to English and Spanish languages, between 2005 and 2015 and human studies.--NEW SECTION--All studies are observational by the characteristics of the studied pathology. It is observed that there is a decreased risk of breast cancer in women who had ever breastfed compared to those who had not. This reduced risk is most evident in postmenopausal women but also happens in premenopausal. It has also been observed that protection is increased with increasing lactation duration. The protective effect of breastfeeding happens by differentiation of breast cells, by reduction of the number of ovulatory cycles and by estrogen and carcinogens excretion through human milk. CONCLUSTONS: Breastfeeding is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, and health teams must therefore educate mothers about its beneficial effects to themselves and their children.",spa,"Revista de enfermeria (Barcelona, Spain)",English Abstract,2025-04-23,2015

This paper presents a systematic assessment of research investments awarded to UK institutions and global health metrics assessing disease burden.--NEW SECTION--We systematically sourced research funding data awarded from public and philanthropic organisations between 1997 and 2013. We screened awards for relevance to infection and categorised data by type of science, disease area and specific pathogen. Investments were compared with mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years lived with disability (YLD) across three time points.--NEW SECTION--Between 1997-2013, there were 7398 awards with a total investment of £3.7 billion. An increase in research funding across 2011-2013 was observed for most disease areas, with notable exceptions being sexually transmitted infections and sepsis research where funding decreased. Most funding remains for pre-clinical research (£2.2 billion, 59.4%). Relative to global mortality, DALYs and YLDs, acute hepatitis C, leishmaniasis and African trypanosomiasis received comparatively high levels of funding. Pneumonia, shigellosis, pertussis, cholera and syphilis were poorly funded across all health metrics. Tuberculosis (TB) consistently attracts relatively less funding than HIV and malaria.--NEW SECTION--Most infections have received increases in research investment, alongside decreases in global burden of disease in 2013. The UK demonstrates research strengths in some neglected tropical diseases such as African trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis, but syphilis, cholera, shigellosis and pneumonia remain poorly funded relative to their global burden. Acute hepatitis C appears well funded but the figures do not adequately take into account projected future chronic burdens for this condition. These findings can help to inform global policymakers on resource allocation for research investment.",eng,EBioMedicine,Historical Article,2025-04-23,2016
26870622,NA,Study of Global Health Strategy Based on International Trends: -Promoting Universal Health Coverage Globally and Ensuring the Sustainability of Japan's Universal Coverage of Health Insurance System: Problems and Proposals.,"The Japanese government at present is implementing international health and medical growth strategies mainly from the viewpoint of business. However, the United Nations is set to resolve the Post-2015 Development Agenda in the fall of 2015; the agenda will likely include the achievement of universal health coverage (UHC) as a specific development goal. Japan's healthcare system, the foundation of which is its public, nationwide universal health insurance program, has been evaluated highly by the Lancet. The World Bank also praised it as a global model. This paper presents suggestions and problems for Japan regarding global health strategies, including in regard to several prerequisite domestic preparations that must be made. They are summarized as follows. (1) The UHC development should be promoted in coordination with the United Nations, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank. (2) The universal health insurance system of Japan can be a global model for UHC and ensuring its sustainability should be considered a national policy. (3) Trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) should not disrupt or interfere with UHC, the form of which is unique to each nation, including Japan. (4) Japan should disseminate information overseas, including to national governments, people, and physicians, regarding the course of events that led to the establishment of the Japan's universal health insurance system and should make efforts to develop international human resources to participate in UHC policymaking. (5) The development of separate healthcare programs and UHC preparation should be promoted by streamlining and centralizing maternity care, school health, infectious disease management such as for tuberculosis, and emergency medicine such as for traffic accidents. (6) Japan should disseminate information overseas about its primary care physicians (kakaritsuke physicians) and develop international human resources. (7) Global health should be developed in integration with global environment problem management. (8) Support systems, such as for managing large-scale disasters of international scale or preventing the spread of infectious diseases, should be developed and maintained. (9) International healthcare policy, which the Japanese government is trying to promote in accordance with international trends, and international development of Japanese healthcare industry should be reconsidered.",eng,Japan Medical Association journal : JMAJ,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26867368,NA,INFLUENCE OF PERCEIVED RISK OF SMOKING AND SECOND-HAND SMOKE ON SELF-REGULATORY BEHAVIOR AMONG PREGNANT TAIWANESE WOMEN.,"Tobacco use is a global health problem, including in Taiwan. The present study evaluated the perceived risk of smoking and second-hand smoke among pregnant Taiwanese women using a questionnaire. Seven hundred twenty-four pregnant Taiwanese women were recruited from an online parenting community using convenience sampling in 2013. Pregnant smokers and non-smokers had significantly different perceptions regarding risk of smoking and second-hand smoke during pregnancy. Pregnant non-smokers adopted more behaviors to avoid second-hand smoke both at home and in public than pregnant smokers. We conclude that perceived fetal health risks from smoking and second-hand smoke influenced maternal behavior during pregnancy. Pregnant women's perceptions of the risk of tobacco smoke depended on whether their focus in the decision-making process was on prevention or promotion. Understanding the risk factors associated with smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke during pregnancy may help in developing strategies to reduce such exposure.",eng,The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Diabetes-induced renal damage is associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Alpha (AT) and gamma-tocopherols (GT) have shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in inflammation-mediated injuries. The primary aim of this study was to investigate effects of AT and GT supplementations on hyperglycemia induced acute kidney inflammation in alloxan induced diabetic mice with different levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG).--NEW SECTION--Diabetes was induced by injection of alloxan monohydrate (150 mg/kg, i.p) in ICR mice (5.5-week-old, male) and mice were subdivided according to their FBG levels and treated with different diets for 2 weeks; CON: non-diabetic mice, m-DMC: diabetic control mice with mild FBG levels (250 mg/dl ≤ FBG ≤ 450 mg/dl), m-AT: m-DM mice fed AT supplementation (35 mg/kg diet), m-GT: m-DM mice with GT supplementation (35 mg/kg diet), s-DMC: diabetic control mice with severe FBG levels (450 mg/dl < FBG), s-AT: s-DM mice with AT supplementation, s-GT: s-DM mice with GT supplementation.--NEW SECTION--Both AT and GT supplementations showed similar beneficial effects on NFκB associated inflammatory response (phosphorylated inhibitory kappa B-α, interleukin-1β, C-reactive protein, monocyte chemotactic protein-1) and pre-fibrosis (tumor growth factor β-1 and protein kinase C-II) as well as an antioxidant emzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in diabetic mice. On the other hands, AT and GT showed different beneficial effects on kidney weight, FBG, and oxidative stress associated makers (malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) except HO-1. In particular, GT significantly preserved kidney weight in m-DM and improved FBG levels in s-DM and malondialdehyde and catalase in m- and s-DM, while AT significantly attenuated FBG levels in m-DM and improved glutathione peroxidase in m- and s-DM.--NEW SECTION--The results suggest that AT and GT with similarities and differences would be considered as beneficial nutrients to modulate hyperglycemia induced acute renal inflammation.

The importance of appropriate assessment of QoL in cancer patients is well established, yet strategies that help improve this important patient outcome are relatively scarce.--NEW SECTION--To examine the effectiveness of a brief self-care education program to improve QoL of gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy.--NEW SECTION--Using a randomized controlled trial, 59 patients with gastric cancer and candidate for gastrectomy were randomly assigned either to an intervention group (n = 31) to participate in a brief self-care education program or to a usual-care group (n = 28). Data were collected on patient demographics, and QoL was measured by the QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-STO22 at baseline and 1 month after gastrectomy.--NEW SECTION--There were no statistically significant between-group differences in any subscales of the QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-STO22. However, participants in the brief self-care education program showed significant improvements from baseline in the global health status-QoL scale (t = 2.243, 𝘗 < .05), experience of pain (t = 2.508, 𝘗 < .05), constipation (t = 2.773, 𝘗 < .05), and the experience of dysphagia at the follow-up assessment.--NEW SECTION--This study is likely to be underpowered to show differences between the groups.--NEW SECTION--A brief self-care education program was not sufficient to significantly improve the quality of life patients with gastric cancer after gastrectomy.",eng,The Journal of community and supportive oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Haiti currently lacks a well-resourced and structured trauma system and in turn loses an estimated 800,000 y of healthy life to injuries annually. In the present study, we perform a nationwide trauma capacity assessment, and using the World Health Organization's Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care as a framework, we attempt to identify achievable steps that can be taken toward improving trauma care in Haiti.--NEW SECTION--This cross-sectional study was performed at 12 facilities nationally using a survey tool assessing the areas of infrastructure, supplies and equipment, personnel and training, and procedural capabilities. Additionally, the total number of trauma cases presenting to each facility was tabulated from emergency room logbooks.--NEW SECTION--A total of six secondary and six tertiary facilities were surveyed. Secondary facilities received an average of 35 trauma cases per week, whereas tertiary facilities received an average of 65 cases per week. Survey results demonstrated a shortage of airway, breathing, and circulation equipment and supplies in both facility levels, particularly in emergency rooms. All facilities lacked access to essential surgical personnel and trauma training.--NEW SECTION--This study makes recommendations for improvements in trauma care in Haiti in the areas of infrastructure and administration, physical resources, and training and human resources.

In order for health care providers to effectively attract patients, more knowledge is needed on the mechanisms underlying decision-making of potential travelers from different countries. A particularly promising method of studying the travelers' motives is collecting data on social media.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this study was to test what factors influence decision-making of potential medical travelers and how these factors interact. Based on existing literature, the factors analyzed included quality, cost, and waiting time for 2 procedures varying in invasiveness across 12 different destination countries.--NEW SECTION--Decision-making patterns were examined using a pilot questionnaire that generated a large amount of data from over 800 participants in 40 countries. Participants indicated their willingness to travel given different scenarios. Each scenario consisted of a combination of several factors. Additionally, participants were asked to indicate the reasons for their choice.--NEW SECTION--Individuals display high willingness to travel for medical care when combining all participants and scenarios, travel for care was chosen 66.9% of the time. Among the factors influencing their decisions, quality of the medical procedure abroad was considered most important, and cost was least important as shown by chi-square tests and corresponding odds ratios. Log-linear analyses revealed an interaction between time waiting in the local health care system and type of procedure, whereby time pressure increased the odds of agreeing to travel for the more invasive procedure. The odds of traveling to Europe and the USA were by far the highest, although participants indicated that under certain conditions they might be willing to travel to other medical destinations, such as Asia.--NEW SECTION--Our measurements yielded several reliable insights into the factors driving medical decision-making.

While there are a number of nonsurgical and surgical options for treatment, the incidence of obesity continues to increase at an alarming rate. The inability to curtail the growing rise of the obesity epidemic may be related to a combination of increased food availability and palatability. Research into feeding behavior has yielded a number of insights into the homeostatic and reward mechanisms that govern feeding. However, there remains a gap between laboratory investigations of feeding physiology in animals and translation into meaningful treatment options for humans. In addition, laboratory investigation may not be able to recapitulate all aspects of human food consumption.

Emergence is often driven by anthropogenic activity (e.g., travel, land use change). Although disease emergence frameworks suggest multiple steps from initial zoonotic transmission to human-to-human spread, there have been few attempts to empirically model specific steps. We create a process-based framework to separate out components of individual emergence steps. We focus on early emergence and expand the first step, zoonotic transmission, into processes of generation of pathogen richness, transmission opportunity, and establishment, each with its own hypothesized drivers. Using this structure, we build a spatial empirical model of these drivers, taking bat viruses shared with humans as a case study. We show that drivers of both viral richness (host diversity and climatic variability) and transmission opportunity (human population density, bushmeat hunting, and livestock production) are associated with virus sharing between humans and bats. We also show spatial heterogeneity between the global patterns of these two processes, suggesting that high-priority locations for pathogen discovery and surveillance in wildlife may not necessarily coincide with those for public health intervention. Finally, we offer direction for future studies of zoonotic EIDs by highlighting the importance of the processes underlying their emergence.",eng,The American naturalist,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Biomarkers of the early phase of this progressive disease are of utmost importance for global health. In this context, saliva represents a non-invasive biosample. By using systems biology tools, we aimed to (1) identify an integrated interactome between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-REDOX/nitric oxide (NO) and apoptosis upstream pathways of periodontal inflammation, and (2) characterize the attendant topological network properties to uncover putative biomarkers to be tested in saliva from patients with periodontitis. Hence, we first generated a protein-protein network model of interactions (""BIOMARK"" interactome) by using the STRING 10 database, a search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins, with ""Experiments"" and ""Databases"" as input options and a confidence score of 0.400. Second, we determined the centrality values (closeness, stress, degree or connectivity, and betweenness) for the ""BIOMARK"" members by using the Cytoscape software. We found Ubiquitin C (UBC), Jun proto-oncogene (JUN), and matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14) as the most central hub- and non-hub-bottlenecks among the 211 genes/proteins of the whole interactome. We conclude that UBC, JUN, and MMP14 are likely an optimal candidate group of host-derived biomarkers, in combination with oral pathogenic bacteria-derived proteins, for detecting periodontitis at its early phase by using salivary samples from patients. These findings therefore have broader relevance for systems medicine in global health as well.",eng,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

ESBL-producing E. coli, was observed in 53% of hospitalized and 44% in out-patients, latest one being in 2014. All ESBL-producing E. coli remained susceptible to amikacin, carbapenems except ertapenem (in-patients = 6%, out-patients = 11%).--NEW SECTION--High emerging ESBL-producing E. coli from urine samples in hospitalized and out-patients is an extremely worrisome sign of development of untreatable infections in the near future on the island. We therefore emphasize the immediate need for establishment of optimal therapy guidelines based on the country specific surveillance programs. The need for new treatment strategies, urgent prescription habit changes and ban of over-the-counter sale of antimicrobials at each segment of healthcare services is also discussed in this research.",eng,Frontiers in microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Autonomic dysfunction and disordered breathing patterns are commonly observed in patients with CHF, and both are strongly related to poor prognosis and high mortality risk. Tonic activation of carotid body (CB) chemoreceptors contributes to sympathoexcitation and disordered breathing patterns in experimental models of CHF. Recent studies show that ablation of the CB chemoreceptors improves autonomic function and breathing control in CHF and improves survival. These exciting findings indicate that alterations in CB function are critical to the progression of CHF. Therefore, better understanding of the physiology of the CB chemoreflex in CHF could lead to improvements in current treatments and clinical management of patients with CHF characterized by high chemosensitivity. Accordingly, the main focus of this brief review is to summarize current knowledge of CB chemoreflex function in different experimental models of CHF and to comment on their potential translation to treatment of human CHF.",eng,BioMed research international,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The technology is widely applied to maternity care in the United States, where comprehensive standard ultrasound examinations are routine. Targeted scans are common and used for an increasing number of clinical indications due to emerging research and a greater availability of equipment with better image resolution at lower cost. These factors contribute to an increased demand for obstetric ultrasound education among students and providers of maternity care, despite a paucity of data to inform education program design and evaluation. To meet this demand, from 2012 to 2015 the University of California, San Francisco nurse-midwifery education program developed and implemented an interprofessional obstetric ultrasound course focused on clinical applications commonly managed by maternity care providers from different professions and disciplines. The course included matriculating students in nursing and medicine, as well as licensed practitioners such as registered and advanced practice nurses, midwives, and physicians and residents in obstetrics and gynecology and family medicine. After completing 10 online modules with a pre- and posttest of knowledge and interprofessional competencies related to teamwork and communication, trainees attended a case-based seminar and hands-on skills practicum with pregnant volunteers. The course aimed to establish a foundation for further supervised clinical training prior to independent practice of obstetric ultrasound. Course development was informed by professional guidelines and clinical and education research literature. This article describes the foundations, with a review of the challenges and solutions encountered in obstetric ultrasound education development and implementation.

Participation in prenatal care has been shown to improve outcomes, even in the absence of treatment for substance use disorders. Unfortunately, women with substance use disorders often do not receive adequate prenatal care. Barriers to accessing care for pregnant women with substance use disorders include medical and psychiatric comorbidities, transportation, caring for existing children, housing and food insecurity, and overall lack of resources. In a health care system where care is delivered by each discipline separately, lack of communication between providers causes poorly coordinated services and missed opportunities. The integration of mental health and substance use treatment services in medical settings is a goal of health care reform. However, this approach has not been widely promoted in the context of maternity care. The Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Perinatal Addiction Treatment Program provides an integrated model of care for pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorders, including the colocation of midwifery services in the context of a dedicated addiction treatment program. A structured approach to screening and intervention for drug and alcohol use in the outpatient prenatal clinic facilitates referral to treatment at the appropriate level. Providing midwifery care within the context of a substance use treatment program improves access to prenatal care, continuity of care throughout pregnancy and the postpartum, and availability of family planning services. The evolution of this innovative approach is described.

They have set ambitious targets toward the goal of ending the three diseases by 2030. These numerical indicators, based on infectious disease modeling, can assist in measuring countries' progressive realization of the right to health. However, they only nominally reference the catastrophic impact that human rights abuses have on access to health services; they also do not measure the positive impact provided by law reform, legal aid, and other health-related human rights programs. Drawing on experience at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which has incorporated expanded stakeholder consultation and human rights programming into its grants, the article argues that addressing human rights barriers to access is often an ad hoc activity occurring on the sidelines of a health grantmaking process that has focused on the scale-up of biomedical programs to meet global health indicators.

The identification of access to palliative care and pain treatment as a human rights issue first emerged among palliative care advocates, physicians, and lawyers in the 1990s, with a basis in the right to health and the right to be free from cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Using a case study approach, we evaluate the results of a human rights-based advocacy approach on access to pain medicine and palliative care in India, Kenya, and Ukraine. In each country, human rights advocacy helped raise awareness of the issue, identify structural barriers to care, define government obligations, and contribute to the reform of laws, policies, and practices impeding the availability of palliative care services. In addition, advocacy efforts stimulated civil society engagement and high-level political leadership that fostered the implementation of human rights-based palliative care programs.

Many studies have investigated the association between venous thromboembolism and heart failure, but have yielded inconsistent findings. We aimed to quantify the absolute and relative risks (RR) for venous thromboembolism in patients with heart failure after hospital admission. We also assessed rates of venous thromboembolism in patients in different settings.--NEW SECTION--In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched for studies investigating the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients in hospital with heart failure. We searched for studies published between Jan 1, 1955, and March 31, 2015, in PubMed, Embase, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Ovid HealthSTAR, Global Health, Ovid Nursing Database, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, ProQuest Central, Conference Papers Index, BIOSIS Previews, and ClinicalTrials.gov. All cohort studies and subgroup analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion if they reported venous thromboembolism rates (number of events per follow-up period) or RR estimates.

Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effects of SES on care-seeking behaviour, injury severity, and treatment outcome.--NEW SECTION--SES wealth score, care-seeking prior to visiting hospital, injury severity, treatment outcome.--NEW SECTION--Patients aged 1-89 presented with road traffic injuries (59.83%), falls (7.76%), and penetrating trauma (6.16%), and had higher SES than the broader urban Cameroonian population. Within the Yaoundé sample, being in the lowest SES quintile was associated with an increased likelihood of having sought care elsewhere before presenting to the hospital (aOR=3.28, p<0.001), after controlling for background and injury characteristics. Patients in the lowest SES quintile were also more likely to present with moderate/severe injuries (aOR=4.93, p<0.001), and were more likely to be transferred to the operating room.--NEW SECTION--Patients presenting to this trauma centre were wealthier than the broader community, suggesting the possibility of barriers to accessing care. Poorer patients were more likely to have severe injuries and more likely to need surgery, but were less likely to seek care from a major trauma centre immediately.

Two authors independently reviewed the studies retrieved by the scientific literature search, identified relevant studies, and extracted the data. We investigated the associations between maternal HIV infection in women naive to antiretroviral therapy and 11 perinatal outcomes: preterm birth, very preterm birth, low birthweight, very low birthweight, term low birthweight, preterm low birthweight, small for gestational age, very small for gestational age, miscarriage, stillbirth, and neonatal death. We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case-control studies reporting perinatal outcomes in HIV-positive women naive to antiretroviral therapy and HIV-negative controls.

We aim to estimate COPD prevalence and number of disease cases for the years 1990 and 2010 across world regions based on the best available evidence in publicly accessible scientific databases.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a systematic search of Medline, EMBASE and Global Health for original, population-based studies providing spirometry-based prevalence rates of COPD across the world from January 1990 to December 2014. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted on extracted crude prevalence rates of COPD, with overall summaries of the meta-estimates (and confidence intervals) reported separately for World Health Organization (WHO) regions, the World Bank's income categories and settings (urban and rural). We developed a meta-regression epidemiological model that we used to estimate the prevalence of COPD in people aged 30 years or more.--NEW SECTION--Our search returned 37 472 publications. A total of 123 studies based on a spirometry-defined prevalence were retained for the review. From the meta-regression epidemiological model, we estimated about 227.3 million COPD cases in the year 1990 among people aged 30 years or more, corresponding to a global prevalence of 10.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.3%-14.0%) in this age group. The number of COPD cases increased to 384 million in 2010, with a global prevalence of 11.7% (8.4%-15.0%). This increase of 68.9% was mainly driven by global demographic changes. Across WHO regions, the highest prevalence was estimated in the Americas (13.3% in 1990 and 15.2% in 2010), and the lowest in South East Asia (7.9% in 1990 and 9.7% in 2010). The percentage increase in COPD cases between 1990 and 2010 was the highest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (118.7%), followed by the African region (102.1%), while the European region recorded the lowest increase (22.5%). In 1990, we estimated about 120.9 million COPD cases among urban dwellers (prevalence of 13.2%) and 106.3 million cases among rural dwellers (prevalence of 8.8%).

26751710,10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.12.033,Deviance and resistance: Malaria elimination in the greater Mekong subregion.,"Malaria elimination rather than control is increasingly globally endorsed, requiring new approaches wherein success is not measured by timely treatment of presenting cases but eradicating all presence of infection. This shift has gained urgency as resistance to artemisinin-combination therapies spreads in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) posing a threat to global health security. In the GMS, endemic malaria persists in forested border areas and elimination will require calibrated approaches to remove remaining pockets of residual infection. A new public health strategy called 'positive deviance' is being used to improve health promotion and community outreach in some of these zones. However, outbreaks sparked by alternative understandings of appropriate behaviour expose the unpredictable nature of 'border malaria' and difficulties eradication faces. Using a recent spike in infections allegedly linked to luxury timber trade in Thai borderlands, this article suggests that opportunities for market engagement can cause people to see 'deviance' as a means to material advancement in ways that increase disease vulnerability. A malaria outbreak in Ubon Ratchathani was investigated during two-week field-visit in November 2014 as part of longer project researching border malaria in Thai provinces. Qualitative data were collected in four villages in Ubon's three most-affected districts. Discussions with villagers focused primarily on changing livelihoods, experience with malaria, and rosewood cutting. Informants included ten men and two women who had recently overnighted in the nearby forest. Data from health officials and villagers are used to frame Ubon's rise in malaria transmission within moral and behavioural responses to expanding commodity supply-chains. The article argues that elimination strategies in the GMS must contend with volatile outbreaks among border populations wherein 'infectiousness' and 'resistance' are not simply pathogen characteristics but also behavioural dimensions born of insistent market aspirations.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The growing magnitude of disability in patients with stroke in India poses a major public health challenge. Given the nature of the condition, affected individuals often become disabled with profound effects on their quality of life. The availability of rehabilitation services for people with disabilities is inadequate in India. Rehabilitation services are usually offered by private hospitals located in urban areas and many stroke survivors, especially those who are poor or live in rural areas, cannot afford to pay for, or do not have access to, such services. Thus, identification of cost-effective ways to rehabilitate people with stroke-related disability is an important challenge. Educational interventions in stroke rehabilitation can assist stroke survivors to make informed decisions regarding their on-going treatment and to self-manage their condition with support from their caregivers. Although educational interventions have been shown to improve patient knowledge for self-management of stroke, an optimal format for the intervention has not as yet been established, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This formative research study aims to systematically develop an educational intervention for management of post-stroke disability for stroke survivors in India, and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the intervention using Smartphones and with caregiver support. The research study will be conducted in Chennai, India, and will be organised in three different phases. Phase 1: Development of the intervention. Phase 2: Field testing and finalising the intervention. Phase 3: Piloting of the intervention and assessment of feasibility and acceptability. A mixed-methods approach will be used to develop and evaluate the intervention. If successful, it will help realise the potential of using Smartphone-enabled, carer-supported educational intervention to bridge the gaps in service access for rehabilitation of individuals with stroke-related disability in India. The proposed research will also provide valuable information for clinicians and policymakers.",eng,BMJ innovations,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Recently, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, sequence type (ST) 313, has been identified as the predominant cause of iNTS disease in multiple sub-Saharan African countries.--NEW SECTION--We conducted multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to determine the prevalence of the ST313 genotype in a sample of blood isolates from ambulatory HIV-infected Mozambican adults with iNTS disease.--NEW SECTION--Of the 29 samples of NTS obtained and analyzed by MLST, all (29/29) were assigned the ST313 sequence type based on the set of allele types derived from each of the seven loci. For quality control, five randomly selected strains taken from the original cultures were confirmed as ST313, and the positive control strain SL3261 (taken from the original culture) was categorized as S. Typhimurium ST19.--NEW SECTION--S. Typhimurium ST313 is an important example of a widely distributed pathogen that lacks a coordinated strategy for control. The highly vulnerable populations at risk for ST313 infection in Mozambique, and within the region, would benefit greatly from the development of new policy and on-the-ground capacity to support increased surveillance, prevention, and treatment initiatives.",eng,Journal of global infectious diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We aimed to assess the validity and reliability of the Malaysian Chinese version of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire core (QLQ-C30) in patients with colorectal cancer.--NEW SECTION--Translated versions of the QLQ-C30 were obtained from the EORTC. A cross sectional study design was used to obtain data from patients receiving treatment at two teaching hospitals in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Malaysian Chinese version of QLQ-C30 was self-administered in 96 patients while the Karnofsky Performance Scales (KPS) was generated by attending surgeons. Statistical analysis included reliability, convergent, discriminate validity, and known-groups comparisons. Statistical significance was based on p value ≤0.05.--NEW SECTION--The internal consistencies of the Malaysian Chinese version were acceptable [Cronbach's alpha (α≥ 0.70)] in the global health status/overall quality of life (GHS/QOL), functioning scales except cognitive scale (α≤0.32) in all levels of analysis, and social/family functioning scale (α=0.63) in patients without a stoma. All questionnaire items fulfilled the criteria for convergent and discriminant validity except question number 5, with correlation with role (r = 0.62) and social/family (r = 0.41) functioning higher than with physical functioning scales (r = 0.34). The test-retest coefficients in the GHS/QOL, functioning scales and in most of the symptoms scales were moderate to high (r = 0.58 to 1.00). Patients with a stoma reported statistically significant lower physical functioning (p=0.015), social/family functioning (p=0.013), and higher constipation (p=0.010) and financial difficulty (p=0.037) compared to patients without stoma.

This cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the association between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and body mass index and waist circumference status in 5852 Iranian adults within the framework of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS).--NEW SECTION--Intakes of SSBs including carbonated drinks and synthetic fruit juices were measured using a validated food frequency questionnaire. The association between body mass index, waist circumference and body adiposity index in each quartile category of SSB consumption were determined using the multivariable linear regression models. The odds ratio (OR) of general and abdominal obesity in each quartile of SSB consumption was also determined using the multivariable logistic regression models.--NEW SECTION--Mean dietary intake of SSBs was 48.9 g/d or 0.25 servings/d. After adjustment for all potential confounding variables, significant associations were observed between SSB consumption and BMI (β: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.13-0.86), and waist circumference (β: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.40-2.16) in the fourth quartile. There was no significant association between SSB consumption and body adiposity index. Participants who consumed > 57.1 g/d of SSBs had 22% higher risk of general obesity (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.00-1.48) and 35% higher risk of abdominal obesity (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.12-1.61), compared with those in the lowest quartile of SSB consumption.--NEW SECTION--Higher intakes of SSBs were associated with the higher risk of general and abdominal obesity in adults suggesting that limiting the consumption of SSBs may be a practical approach to prevent and manage obesity.",eng,Iranian journal of public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Haiti Air Ambulance is the first completely publicly-available helicopter ambulance service in a developing country. US standards were adopted for both aviation and aeromedical care in Haiti due to proximity and relationships. In order to implement properly, standards for aviation, critical care, and insurance reimbursement had to be put in place with local authorities. Haiti Air Ambulance worked with the Ministry of Health to author standards for medical procedures, medication usage, and staff training for aeromedical programs in the country. Utilisation criteria for the helicopter were drafted, edited, and constantly updated to ensure the program adapted to the clinical situation while maintaining US standard of care. During the first year, 76 patients were transferred; 13 of whom were children and 3 pregnant women. Three patients were intubated and two required bi-level mask ventilation. Traumatic injury and non-emergency interfacility transfers were the two most common indications for service. More than half of the transfers (54%) originated at one of six hospitals, mostly as a result of highly-involved staff. The program was limited by weather and the lack of weather reporting, radar, visual flight recognition, thus also causing an inability to fly at night. In partnership with the government and other non-governmental organisations, we seek to implement a more robust pre-hospital system in Haiti over the next 12-24 months, including more scene call capabilities.",eng,Injury,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

According to the World health organization's prediction the number of obese patients in the adult population will increase to 700 million by 2015. The reasons of constantly increasing prevalence of obesity include a combination of genetic predisposition, the predominance of energy intake over energy expenditure due to easy availability of calorie-rich meals and permanently decreasing energy expenditure from physical activity. Understanding the precise mechanisms of food intake regulation is essential for development of body weight-reducing drugs with long-term effects. The central nervous system plays the main role in the regulation of food intake. This system is influenced by a number of long-acting and short-acting peripheral signals informing about the degree of saturation, the amount of energy reserves and the overall state of energy homeostasis. Hormones produced in the gastrointestinal tract play an important role in the regulation of food intake. The aim of this article is to summarize the significance of selected gut hormones in the regulation of food intake and to discuss their possible use in the treatment of obesity and its associated comorbidities.",cze,Ceskoslovenska fysiologie,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The prevalence of this infection is related to the association with other diseases, such as HIV, neglect treatment and misuse of antibiotics. Hence, the identification of new drugs is required to eradicate TB. Possible alternatives to existing antibiotics include pure compounds extracted from medicinal plants, which are an important source of antimicrobial agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and α-mangostin on Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth and bacterial survival in infected macrophages derived from the human THP-1 cell line and monocytes. Our results show that both compounds directly inhibit M. tuberculosis growth in liquid medium with Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) of 250 and 62 μg/mL respectively, likely through preventing bacterial replication. In addition, NDGA and α-mangostin were able to induce autophagy in human cells at lower concentrations (7 and 6 μg/mL, respectively) and contributed to the elimination of intracellular bacteria. NDGA and α-mangostin could be candidates for coadjuvant therapy in cases of drug-resistant TB, and their ability to enhance the immune response by promoting autophagy might contribute to TB treatment.",eng,International immunopharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The magnitude of this unmet need has been described recently, and the numbers are startling. Major shifts in global health agenda have highlighted access to essential and emergency surgery as a high priority. A broad examination of the current global neurosurgical efforts to improve access has revealed some strengths, particularly in the realm of training; however, the demand grossly outstrips the supply; most people in low-income countries do not have access to basic surgical care, either due to lack of availability or affordability. Projects that help create a robust and resilient health system within low- and middle-income countries require urgent implementation. In this context, concurrent scale-up of human resources, investments in capacity building, local data collection, and analysis for accurate assessment are essential.

The coinage indicates that the spread of infectious disease transforms the spatial coordinates of the modern political environment. This article analyses this transformation by asking how the legal regime, designed to prepare for the pandemic, envisions the globe as an object of government. It demonstrates that the WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR) articulate a space of global circulation that exhibits two features. First, the infrastructures of microbial traffic become the primary matters of concern. The IHR do not focus on human life so much as they aim at securing transnational mobilities. Second, the IHR circumscribe a space that is fragmented by zones of intensified governmental control at transportational nodal points, such as airports and harbours. In these zones, technologies of screening and quarantine are applied to modulate the connectivity of people, organic matter and things. As a whole, the article investigates how processes of de- and re-territorialisation interact in the context of global health security. In analysing forms of legal worldmaking, it unearths a nomos of global circulation which applies its regulatory force to the post-human materialities of microbial traffic.",eng,Journal of international relations and development,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The framing of infectious disease as a threat to global public health and economic security coincides with preemptive forms of control. A particular type of preemptive regulation is global pandemic influenza planning that entails the governing of an imminent, albeit uncertain, global health event. We examine the discourse of 'preparedness' within pandemic planning documents produced by the World Health Organization from 1999 to 2009. We present key findings on: the construction of the influenza virus in terms of its potential to transform and expand across corporeal and territorial boundaries; and the integration of pandemic preparedness into everyday practices. Our analysis illustrates how the discourse of preparedness links the justification for population-level preemptive approaches to discursive constructions of the virus.

26719269,10.1128/JVI.02546-15,Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Require Direct Infection To Sustain the Pulmonary Influenza A Virus-Specific CD8 T Cell Response.,"Following influenza A virus (IAV) infection, development of a robust IAV-specific CD8 T cell response is required for clearance of primary infection and enhances memory protection. Following IAV infection, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) or CD8α(+) DC regulate pulmonary effector CD8 T cell responses within the lung. Without this DC-T cell interaction, insufficient effector CD8 T cells are maintained in the lungs, leading to enhanced morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated that pDC are capable of classical presentation or cross-presentation of IAV antigens and could potentially regulate IAV-specific CD8 T cell responses through either mechanism. Our results demonstrate that pDC from the lungs of donor mice infected with an IAV that is not able to replicate in hematopoietic cells (142t-IAV), unlike donor pDC isolated from the lungs of control infected mice, are not able to rescue the host IAV-specific CD8 T cell response from apoptosis. This indicates that pDC must utilize the direct presentation pathway for this rescue. This inability of pDC from 142t-IAV donors to rescue the IAV-specific CD8 T cell response is not due to differences in the overall ability of 142t-IAV to replicate within the lungs or generate defective viral genomes or to differences in levels of costimulatory molecules required for this interaction. We further demonstrate that bypassing the antigen presentation pathway by coating the 142t-IAV pDC with IAV peptide epitopes restores their ability to rescue the IAV-specific CD8 T cell response.--NEW SECTION--IAV continues to be a global health burden, infecting 5 to 20% of the global population annually. Continued investigation into the mechanisms that mediate protective immune responses against IAV is important to improving current vaccination and antiviral strategies antagonistic toward IAV. Our findings presented herein demonstrate a key requirement for pDC promotion of effector CD8 T cell survival: that rather than utilizing cross-presentation, pDC must be infected and utilize the endogenous pathway for presentation of antigens to CD8 T cells during in vivo IAV infections. This suggests that targeting presentation via the endogenous pathway in pDC could be important for the development of unique antiviral cellular therapies.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The Ethiopian total fertility rate was estimated at 4.8 in 2011, and the use of contraceptives by married women was 29%. Lack of knowledge, cultural stigma surrounding abortion, and barriers to access of services contribute to persistently high rates of unsafe abortion and abortion-related mortality. This study seeks to assess the generation and institutionalization of political priority for reproductive health within the political systems of Ethiopia. Interviews with key policy makers, government ministers, academics, and leaders of prominent non-governmental organizations in Ethiopia between July 2010 and January 2011 were conducted, using Shiffman and Smith's Framework, to analyse the key actors and ideas behind the shift towards prioritization of reproductive health in Ethiopia, as well as the political context and primary characteristics of the issues that propelled progressive action in reproductive health in that country. Some of the key lessons point to the readiness of the Ethiopian government to reform and to improve the socio-economic status of the population. The role of civil society organizations working alongside the government was crucial to creating a window of opportunity in a changing political climate to achieve gains in reproductive health. To our knowledge, this is the first time Shiffman and Smith's Framework has been used for reproductive health policies. We conclude that Ethiopian experience fits well within this framework for understanding prioritization of global health issues and may serve as a model for other sub-Saharan African countries.",eng,Reproductive health matters,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Multiple partners join in international consortia that operate under the limited timeframe of a specific funding period. One organisation (the sponsor) designs and carries out the trial in collaboration with research partners, and is ultimately responsible for the trial's scientific, ethical, regulatory and legal aspects, while another organization, generally in the North (the funder), provides the external funding and sets funding conditions. Even if external funding mechanisms are key for most non-commercial research, the dependence on an external funder's policies may heavily influence the choices of a sponsor. In addition, the competition for accessing the available external funds is great, and non-commercial sponsors may not be in a position to discuss or refuse standard conditions set by a funder. To see whether the current definitions adequately address the intricacies of sponsorship in externally-funded trials, we looked at how a ""sponsor"" of clinical trials is defined in selected international guidelines, with particular focus on international Good Clinical Practices codes, and in selected European and African regulations/legislations.--NEW SECTION--Our limited analysis suggests that the sponsors definition from the 1995 WHO Good Clinical Practices code has been integrated as such into many legislations, guidelines and regulations, and that it is not adequate to cover today's reality of funding arrangements in global health, where the legal responsibility and the funding source are de facto split. In agreement with other groups, we suggest that the international Good Clinical Practices codes should be updated to reflect the reality of non-commercial clinical research. In particular, they should explicitly include the distinction between commercial and non-commercial sponsors, and provide guidance to non-commercial sponsors for negotiating with external funding agencies and other research counterparts. Non-commercial sponsors of clinical trials should surely invest in the development of adequate legal, administrative and management skills. By acknowledging their role and specificities, and by providing them with adapted guidance, the international Good Clinical Practices codes would provide valuable guidance and support to non-commercial clinical research, whose relevance for global health is increasingly evident.",eng,BMC international health and human rights,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In the last phases of malaria elimination, as universal interventions reap diminishing marginal returns, national resources must become increasingly devoted to identifying where residual transmission is occurring. The needs for accurate measures of progress and practical advice about how to allocate scarce resources require new analytical methods to quantify fine-grained heterogeneity in malaria risk. Using routine national surveillance data from Swaziland (a sub-Saharan country on the verge of elimination), we estimated individual reproductive numbers. Fine-grained maps of reproductive numbers and local malaria importation rates were combined to show 'malariogenic potential', a first for malaria elimination.

We developed a Bayesian model using data from 102 national surveys, triangulated against delivery data and distribution reports, to generate year-by-year estimates of four ITN coverage indicators. We explored the impact of two potential 'inefficiencies': uneven net distribution among households and rapid rates of net loss from households. We estimated that, in 2013, 21% (17%-26%) of ITNs were over-allocated and this has worsened over time as overall net provision has increased. We estimated that rates of ITN loss from households are more rapid than previously thought, with 50% lost after 23 (20-28) months. We predict that the current estimate of 920 million additional ITNs required to achieve universal coverage would in reality yield a lower level of coverage (77% population access). By improving efficiency, however, the 920 million ITNs could yield population access as high as 95%.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The aim of this study was to test whether some psychological variables can be used as potential early prognostic factors of TFW.--NEW SECTION--A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the associations between predictive variables and TFW. Predictors were global health, pain at hospitalisation and pain decrease during the stay (all continuous and standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing by two standard deviations), perceived severity of the trauma and expectation of a positive evolution (both binary variables).--NEW SECTION--Full data were available for 807 inpatients (660 men, 147 women). TFW was positively associated with better perceived health (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.19), pain decrease (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.30-1.64) and expectation of a positive evolution (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.32-1.70) and negatively associated with pain at hospitalisation (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.59-0.76) and high perceived severity (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.85).--NEW SECTION--The present results provide some evidence that work disability during a four-year period after rehabilitation may be predicted by prerehabilitation perceptions of general health, pain, injury severity, as well as positive expectation of evolution.",eng,Swiss medical weekly,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The control and eventual elimination of P. vivax are global health priorities. Genomic research contributes to this objective by improving our understanding of the biology of P. vivax and through the development of new genetic markers that can be used to monitor efforts to reduce malaria transmission. Here we analyze whole-genome data from eight field samples from a region in Cordóba, Colombia where malaria is endemic. We find considerable genetic diversity within this population, a result that contrasts with earlier studies suggesting that P. vivax had limited diversity in the Americas. We also identify a selective sweep around a substitution known to confer resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). This is the first observation of a selective sweep for SP resistance in this species. These results indicate that P. vivax has been exposed to SP pressure even when the drug is not in use as a first line treatment for patients afflicted by this parasite. We identify multiple non-synonymous substitutions in three other genes known to be involved with drug resistance in Plasmodium species. Finally, we found extensive microsatellite polymorphisms. Using this information we developed 18 polymorphic and easy to score microsatellite loci that can be used in epidemiological investigations in South America.",eng,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, the effectiveness and large-scale coverage of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) have revolutionized malaria treatment just as the control of lymphatic filariasis (LF) and onchocerciasis have benefitted from harnessing the broad-spectrum effect of avermectin-based derivatives. The paradigm shift in therapeutic approach, effected by these two drugs and their impact on community-based interventions of parasitic diseases plaguing the endemic low- and middle-income countries (LIMCs), led to the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015. However, the story would not be complete without mentioning praziquantel. The huge contribution of this drug in modernizing the control of schistosomiasis and also some intestinal helminth infections had already shifted the focus from control to potential elimination of this disease. Together, these new drugs have provided humankind with powerful new tools for the alleviation of infectious diseases that humans have lived with since time immemorial. These drugs all have broad-spectrum effects, yet they are very safe and can even be packaged together in various combinations. The strong effect on so many of the great infectious scourges in the developing countries has not only had a remarkable influence on many endemic diseases, but also contributed to improving the cost structure of healthcare. Significant benefits include improved quality of preventive and curative medicine, promotion of community-based interventions, universal health coverage and the fostering of global partnerships. The laudable progress and benefits achieved are indispensable in championing, strengthening and moving forward elimination of the IDoPs. However, there is an urgent need for further innovative, contextual and integrated approaches along with the advent of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), replacing the MDGs in ensuring global health security, well-being and economic prosperity for all.",eng,Infectious diseases of poverty,Biography,2025-04-23,2015
26707802,10.1186/s13054-015-1149-5,Long-term remote organ consequences following acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been a global health epidemic problem with soaring incidence, increased long-term risks for multiple comorbidities and mortality, as well as elevated medical costs. Despite the improvement of patient outcomes following the advancements in preventive and therapeutic strategies, the mortality rates among critically ill patients with AKI remain as high as 40-60 %. The distant organ injury, a direct consequence of deleterious systemic effects, following AKI is an important explanation for this phenomenon. To date, most evidence of remote organ injury in AKI is obtained from animal models. Whereas the observations in humans are from a limited number of participants in a relatively short follow-up period, or just focusing on the cytokine levels rather than clinical solid outcomes. The remote organ injury is caused with four underlying mechanisms: (1) ""classical"" pattern of acute uremic state; (2) inflammatory nature of the injured kidneys; (3) modulating effect of AKI of the underlying disease process; and (4) healthcare dilemma. While cytokines/chemokines, leukocyte extravasation, oxidative stress, and certain channel dysregulation are the pathways involving in the remote organ damage. In the current review, we summarized the data from experimental studies to clinical outcome studies in the field of organ crosstalk following AKI. Further, the long-term consequences of distant organ-system, including liver, heart, brain, lung, gut, bone, immune system, and malignancy following AKI with temporary dialysis were reviewed and discussed.",eng,"Critical care (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26704179,10.1093/heapol/czv122,BRICS countries and the global movement for universal health coverage.,"This article explores BRICS' engagement in the global movement for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the implications for global health governance. It is based on primary data collected from 43 key informant interviews, complemented by a review of BRICS' global commitments supporting UHC. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire that included both closed- and open-ended questions. Question development was informed by insights from the literature on UHC, Cox's framework for action, and Kingdon's multiple-stream theory of policy formation. The closed questions were analysed with simple descriptive statistics and the open-ended questions using grounded theory approach. The analysis demonstrates that most BRICS countries implicitly supported the global movement for UHC, and that they share an active engagement in promoting UHC. However, only Brazil, China and to some extent South Africa, were recognized as proactively pushing UHC in the global agenda. In addition, despite some concerted actions, BRICS countries seem to act more as individual countries rather that as an allied group. These findings suggest that BRICS are unlikely to be a unified political block that will transform global health governance. Yet the documented involvement of BRICS in the global movement supporting UHC, and their focus on domestic challenges, shows that BRICS individually are increasingly influential players in global health. So if BRICS countries should probably not be portrayed as the centre of future political community that will transform global health governance, their individual involvement in global health, and their documented concerted actions, may give greater voice to low- and middle-income countries supporting the emergence of multiple centres of powers in global health.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26703566,10.3390/ijms161226087,Chronic Hepatitis B with Spontaneous Severe Acute Exacerbation.,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health problem with an estimated 400 million HBV carriers worldwide. In the natural history of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), spontaneous acute exacerbation (AE) is not uncommon, with a cumulative incidence of 10%-30% every year. While exacerbations can be mild, some patients may develop hepatic decompensation and even die. The underlying pathogenesis is possibly related to the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated immune response against HBV. An upsurge of serum HBV DNA usually precedes the rise of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin. Whether antiviral treatment can benefit CHB with severe AE remains controversial, but early nucleos(t)ide analogues treatment seemed to be associated with an improved outcome. There has been no randomized study that compared the effects of different nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) in the setting of CHB with severe AE. However, potent NAs with good resistance profiles are recommended. In this review, we summarized current knowledge regarding the natural history, pathogenetic mechanisms, and therapeutic options of CHB with severe AE.",eng,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Using observational data from the South Swedish Arthritis Treatment Group register, we thus aimed to compare clinical development and treatment adherence between nr-axSpA and AS patients during three years of anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor) therapy in clinical practice, and to explore the impact of inflammatory activity measured by CRP (C-reactive protein) at treatment initiation.--NEW SECTION--Nr-axSpA and AS patients (n = 86/238) in southern Sweden, commencing anti-TNF therapy 1999-2011, were followed during three years. Anti-TNF cessation was defined as stopping therapy, without restarting another anti-TNF agent within three months. Differences in the three year developments of patient's visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for global health and pain, EuroQol 5-Dimensions utility, evaluator's global disease activity assessment, CRP, and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were assessed by repeated ANOVA. Anti-TNF adherence was compared by Log rank test and Cox regression. In a subanalysis, the same outcomes were studied after splitting both groups into patients with/without baseline CRP elevation.--NEW SECTION--Nr-axSpA patients were more often female and had lower acute phase reactants at baseline. Apart from CRP, which remained lower in the nr-axSpA group throughout follow-up (p = 0.004), no between-group differences were detected regarding clinical developments (p >0.1 for all comparisons) or anti-TNF adherence (hazard ratio: 1.1 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.8) for the nr-axSpA vs. AS group) during three years. Elevated baseline CRP was similarly associated with superior clinical outcomes and treatment adherence in both groups.--NEW SECTION--With the exception of constantly lower CRP levels in the nr-axSpA group, three years anti-TNF therapy resulted in similar clinical outcomes and treatment adherence in nr-axSpA and AS patients, thus strengthening the hypothesis that these diagnoses represent different aspects/phases of the same disease.",eng,Arthritis research & therapy,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

This review provides support for the importance of a healthy diet for the ageing population globally.",eng,European journal of nutrition,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26693920,10.1186/s12936-015-1042-3,Ethical aspects of malaria control and research.,"Malaria currently causes more harm to human beings than any other parasitic disease, and disproportionally affects low-income populations. The ethical issues raised by efforts to control or eliminate malaria have received little explicit analysis, in comparison with other major diseases of poverty. While some ethical issues associated with malaria are similar to those that have been the subject of debate in the context of other infectious diseases, malaria also raises distinct ethical issues in virtue of its unique history, epidemiology, and biology. This paper provides preliminary ethical analyses of the especially salient issues of: (i) global health justice, (ii) universal access to malaria control initiatives, (iii) multidrug resistance, including artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) resistance, (iv) mandatory screening, (v) mass drug administration, (vi) benefits and risks of primaquine, and (vii) malaria in the context of blood donation and transfusion. Several ethical issues are also raised by past, present and future malaria research initiatives, in particular: (i) controlled infection studies, (ii) human landing catches, (iii) transmission-blocking vaccines, and (iv) genetically-modified mosquitoes. This article maps the terrain of these major ethical issues surrounding malaria control and elimination. Its objective is to motivate further research and discussion of ethical issues associated with malaria--and to assist health workers, researchers, and policy makers in pursuit of ethically sound malaria control practice and policy.",eng,Malaria journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We hypothesised that surgical disease in low income countries predominantly affects young adults and may therefore have a significant economic impact.--NEW SECTION--We retrospectively reviewed all surgical admission data from two rural government district hospitals in two different sub-Saharan African countries over a 6-month period. We analysed all surgical admissions with respect to patient demographics (age and gender), diagnosis, and procedure performed.--NEW SECTION--Surgical admissions accounted for 12.9 and 19.8 % of all hospital admissions in Malawi and Sierra Leone respectively. 18.5 and 6.2 % of all hospital patients required a surgical procedure in Malawi and Sierra Leone respectively, with the low number in Sierra Leone accounted for in that many of the obstetric admissions were referred to a nearby Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) hospital for treatment. 17.9 and 10.5 % of surgical admissions were under the age of 16 in Malawi and Sierra Leone respectively, with 16-35 year olds accounting for 57.3 % of surgical admissions in Sierra Leone and 53.5 % in Malawi. Men accounted for 53.7 and 46.0 % of surgical admissions in Sierra Leone and Malawi respectively. An unexpected finding was the high level of patients who absconded from hospital in Sierra Leone after diagnosis but before treatment. This involved 11.8 % of all surgical patients, including 38 % with a bowel obstruction, 39 % with peritonitis and 20 % with ectopic pregnancy.--NEW SECTION--Most people affected by disease requiring surgery are young adults and this may have significant economic implications.",eng,SpringerPlus,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Irisin is a newly termed hormone that is related to metabolic diseases. In the present study, the mechanism underlying the effect of Metformin on promoting irisin release from skeletal muscle was investigated.--NEW SECTION--C57BL/6J-ob/ob was orally administrated with Metformin for 4 weeks. The plasma irisin, insulin, and glucose were detected. Mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts C2C12 cells were treated with Metformin for 24 h. The molecules PGC-1α, FNDC5, AMPK, and ERK mRNA/proteins were quantified by real-time PCR and western blotting in vivo and in vitro.--NEW SECTION--Metformin elevated FNDC5 mRNA/protein expression of skeletal muscle and plasma irisin concentration in ob/ob mice. PGC-1α, p-AMPK and p-ERK protein expression was up-regulated by Metformin in skeletal muscle and C2C12 cells. In addition, the decrease in irisin concentration and protein expression of FNDC5, p-AMPK, and p-ERK induced by siRNA-PGC-1α could not be reversed by Metformin.--NEW SECTION--Our study demonstrates that Metformin stimulates irisin secretion from skeletal muscle into the circulation system of obese mice, and that PGC-1α is a critical regulator in this process.",eng,American journal of translational research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Despite the basic science and clinical research advances to better understand and prevent preterm births, the rates are increasing. There are several therapeutic options. While some options such as progestins work for selected women, others such as magnesium sulfate can only be used for delaying births for 24 to 48 hours so that the patients can be treated with corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity. Based on the scientific and clinical evidence, we recommend testing human chorionic gonadotropin in a large multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trials in women with active preterm labor and those with a previous history of preterm births.

26691737,10.1093/femsle/fnv242,Safety and efficacy of phage therapy via the intravenous route.,"Increasing development of antimicrobial resistance is driving a resurgence in interest in phage therapy: the use of bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections. As the lytic action of bacteriophages is unaffected by the antibiotic resistance status of their bacterial target, it is thought that phage therapy may have considerable potential in the treatment of a wide range of topical and localized infections. As yet this interest has not extended to intravenous (IV) use, which is surprising given that the historical record shows that phages are likely to be safe and effective when delivered by this route. Starting almost 100 years ago, phages were administered intravenously in treatment of systemic infections including typhoid, and Staphylococcal bacteremia. There was extensive IV use of phages in the 1940s to treat typhoid, reportedly with outstanding efficacy and safety. The safety of IV phage administration is also underpinned by the detailed work of Ochs and colleagues in Seattle who have over four decades' experience with IV injection into human subjects of large doses of highly purified coliphage PhiX174. Though these subjects included a large number of immune-deficient children, no serious side effects were observed over this extended time period. The large and continuing global health problems of typhoid and Staphylococcus aureus are exacerbated by the increasing antibiotic resistance of these pathogens. We contend that these infections are excellent candidates for use of IV phage therapy.",eng,FEMS microbiology letters,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Providing nearby access to safe drinking water is a primary public health concern and a frequent public health intervention throughout sub-Saharan Africa; access to water eliminates long gathering and transport time and provides an individual with more personal time. Previous research has not reviewed the aspect of time and relationship changes after implemented water interventions.--NEW SECTION--A qualitative phenomenological approach used 52 semistructured interviews to examine relationship experiences among primary water gatherers and their families after receiving nearby access to water. This study took place throughout the historically semiarid eastern region in Kitui, Kenya, where community members have been beneficiaries of various water interventions.--NEW SECTION--Before the water intervention, family members experienced difficulties with irregular meal times and food availability, infrequent family conversations, irritation with lack of bathing and cleanliness, and general discontent without the availability of 1 able-bodied family member. Participants' experiences after implemented water interventions revealed enhanced relationships within household family units; additional personal time was gained and used to rebuild relationships. The newly established relationships included constructive discussions and conversations built around understanding and developing solutions to address economic or individual challenges encountered by the family.--NEW SECTION--This study's findings suggest that relationships significantly improved after households receive access to nearby water. Furthermore, this research provides evidence of an increased need for access to quality water for communities throughout the world to positively contribute to constructive family relationships.",eng,"Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The continuous onset of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains limits the clinical efficacy of most of the marketed antibiotics. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics. Pyrrolomycins are a class of biologically active compounds that exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, anthelmintic, antiproliferative, insecticidal, and acaricidal activities. In this review we focus on the antibacterial activity and antibiofilm activity of pyrrolomycins against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.

In many low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC), only 5-15% of people who require AT have access to them. Rapid demographic changes will exacerbate this situation as populations over 60 years of age, as well as functional limitations among older populations, in LMIC are expected to be higher than in high-income countries in the coming years. Given both these trends, AT are likely to be in high demand and provide many benefits to respond to challenges related to healthy and productive ageing. Multiple databases were searched for English literature. Three groups of keywords were combined: those relating to AT, ageing population and LMIC selected for this study, namely Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Turkey and Zimbabwe. These countries are expected to see the most rapid growth in the 65 and above population in the coming years. Results indicate that all countries had AT designed for older adults with existing impairment and disability, but had limited AT that are designed to prevent impairment and disability among older adults who do not currently have any disabilities. All countries have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The findings conclude that AT for ageing populations have received some attention in LMIC as attested by the limited literature results. Analysis of review findings indicate the need for a comprehensive, integrated health and social system approach to increase the current availability of AT for ageing populations in LMIC. These would entail, yet not be limited to, work on: (1) promoting initiatives for low-cost AT; (2) awareness raising and capacity building on AT; (3) bridging the gap between AT policy and practice; and (4) fostering targeted research on AT.",eng,BMJ innovations,Review,2025-04-23,2015

This meta-analysis examined whether telomere length and depression are associated and explored factors that might affect this association.--NEW SECTION--Studies measuring telomere length in subjects with clinically significant unipolar depression were included. A comprehensive search strategy identified studies in PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. A structured data abstraction form was used and studies were appraised for inclusion or exclusion using a priori conditions. Analyses were conducted using standardized mean differences in a continuous random effects model.--NEW SECTION--Thirty-eight studies (N=34,347) met the inclusion criteria. The association between depression and telomere length was significant, with a Cohen's d effect size of -0.205 (p<0.0001, I(2)=42%). Depression severity significantly associated with telomere length (p=0.03). Trim and fill analysis indicated the presence of publication bias (p=0.003), but that the association remained highly significant after accounting for the bias. Subgroup analysis revealed depression assessment tools, telomere measurement techniques, source tissue and comorbid medical conditions significantly affected the relationship.--NEW SECTION--Other potentially important sub-groups, including antidepressant use, have not been investigated in sufficient detail or number yet and thus were not addressed in this meta-analysis.--NEW SECTION--There is a negative association between depression and telomere length. Further studies are needed to clarify potential causality underlying this association and to elucidate the biology linking depression and this cellular marker of stress exposure and aging.",eng,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We investigated the relationships between G6PD deficiency and both malaria and non-malarial illnesses among children in Kenya.--NEW SECTION--We did this study in Kilifi County, Kenya, where the G6PD c.202T allele is the only significant cause of G6PD deficiency. We tested the associations between G6PD deficiency and severe and complicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria through a case-control study of 2220 case and 3940 control children. Cases were children aged younger than 14 years, who visited the high dependency ward of Kilifi County Hospital with severe malaria between March 1, 1998, and Feb 28, 2010. Controls were children aged between 3-12 months who were born within the same study area between August 2006, and September 2010. We assessed the association between G6PD deficiency and both uncomplicated malaria and other common diseases of childhood in a cohort study of 752 children aged younger than 10 years. Participants of this study were recruited from a representative sample of households within the Ngerenya and Chonyi areas of Kilifi County between Aug 1, 1998, and July 31, 2001. The primary outcome measure for the case-control study was the odds ratio for hospital admission with severe malaria (computed by logistic regression) while for the cohort study it was the incidence rate ratio for uncomplicated malaria and non-malaria illnesses (computed by Poisson regression), by G6PD deficiency category.--NEW SECTION--2863 (73%) children in the control group versus 1643 (74%) in the case group had the G6PD normal genotype, 639 (16%) versus 306 (14%) were girls heterozygous for G6PD c.202T, and 438 (11%) versus 271 (12%) children were either homozygous girls or hemizygous boys. Compared with boys and girls without G6PD deficiency, we found significant protection from severe malaria (odds ratio [OR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·70-0·97; p=0·020) among G6PD c.202T heterozygous girls but no evidence for protection among G6PD c.202T hemizygous boys and homozygous girls (OR 1·18, 0·99-1·40; p=0·056). Median follow-up for the mild disease cohort study was 2·24 years (IQR 2·22-2·85). G6PD c.202T had no effect on other common diseases of childhood in heterozygous girls (incidence rate ratio 0·98, 95% CI 0·86-1·11; p=0·82) or homozygous girls or hemizygous boys (0·93, 0·82-1·04; p=0·25), with the sole exception of a marginally significant increase in the incidence of helminth infections among heterozygous girls.--NEW SECTION--Heterozygous girls might be the driving force for the positive selection of G6PD deficiency alleles. Further studies are needed to definitively establish the mechanisms by which G6PD deficiency confers an advantage against malaria in heterozygous individuals.

A growing number of studies have examined the relationship between psychiatric status and body weight, but our knowledge is still limited.--NEW SECTION--The present study aims to investigate the cross-sectional relationships of psychiatric status and body mass index (BMI) in Málaga, a Mediterranean city in the South of Spain.--NEW SECTION--A total of 563 participants were recruited from those who came to his primary care physician, using a systematic random sampling, non-proportional stratified by BMI categories. Structured clinical interviews were used to assess current Axes-I and II mental disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). BMI was calculated as weight (Kg) divided by square of height in meters (m2). Logistic regression was used to investigate the association between BMI and the presence of any mental disorder. BMI was introduced in the models using restricted cubic splines.--NEW SECTION--We found that high BMI values were directly associated with mood and adjustment disorders, and low BMI values were directly associated with avoidant and dependent personality disorders (PDs). We observed an inverse relationship between low BMI values and cluster A PDs. There were not significant relationships between anxiety or substance-related disorders and BMI.--NEW SECTION--Psychiatric status and BMI are related in a Mediterranean Spanish population.

26684302,10.1186/s12992-015-0135-7,Short term global health experiences and local partnership models: a framework.,"Contemporary interest in in short-term experiences in global health (STEGH) has led to important questions of ethics, responsibility, and potential harms to receiving communities. In addressing these issues, the role of local engagement through partnerships between external STEGH facilitating organization(s) and internal community organization(s) has been identified as crucial to mitigating potential pitfalls. This perspective piece offers a framework to categorize different models of local engagement in STEGH based on professional experiences and a review of the existing literature. This framework will encourage STEGH stakeholders to consider partnership models in the development and evaluation of new or existing programs.The proposed framework examines the community context in which STEGH may occur, and considers three broad categories: number of visiting external groups conducting STEGH (single/multiple), number of host entities that interact with the STEGH (none/single/multiple), and frequency of STEGH (continuous/intermittent). These factors culminate in a specific model that provides a description of opportunities and challenges presented by each model. Considering different models, single visiting partners, working without a local partner on an intermittent (or even one-time) basis provided the greatest flexibility to the STEGH participants, but represented the least integration locally and subsequently the greatest potential harm for the receiving community. Other models, such as multiple visiting teams continuously working with a single local partner, provided an opportunity for centralization of efforts and local input, but required investment in consensus-building and streamlining of processes across different groups. We conclude that involving host partners in the design, implementation, and evaluation of STEGH requires more effort on the part of visiting STEGH groups and facilitators, but has the greatest potential benefit for meaningful, locally-relevant improvements from STEGH for the receiving community. There are four key themes that underpin the application of the framework: 1. Meaningful impact to host communities requires some form of local engagement and measurement. 2. Single STEGH without local partner engagement is rarely ethically justified. 3. Models should be tailored to the health and resource context in which the STEGH occurs. 4. Sending institutions should employ a model that ultimately benefits local receiving communities first and STEGH participants second. Accounting for these themes in program planning for STEGH will lead to more equitable outcomes for both receiving communities and their sending partners.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We report a case of meningitis caused by NDM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, for which intrathecal administration of colistin was curative. A previously healthy 38-year-old Japanese man, who lived in Hyderabad, India, suddenly collapsed and was brought to a local hospital. He was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage and underwent emergency surgery which included partial skull removal. Approximately 1 month after surgery, he was repatriated to Japan and was admitted to our institution with information that he had been treated for multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter infection with colistin. A week after admission, he developed aspiration pneumonia due to NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae, which was successfully treated by intravenous (IV) administration of colistin. Subsequently, he underwent a surgical procedure to repair his skull defect. He developed high-grade fever and altered mental status on postoperative day 2. NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae was identified in the cerebrospinal fluid, establishing the diagnosis of meningitis. Although IV colistin was only partially effective, intrathecal colistin (10 mg daily by lumbar puncture for 14 days) successfully eradicated the meningitis. Because of economic globalization, NDM-1-producing bacteria may be brought to Japan by those who are repatriated after sustaining critical illnesses and being treated in foreign countries.

Cox regression model was used for both univariate and multivariate analyses of OS.--NEW SECTION--Global health status (GH) dimension score at baseline was associated with favourable OS when adjusted for clinical, functional, and histological factors (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.986; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.980-0.992). We distinguished three groups according to GH score: high (GH <46), intermediate (46 ≤ GH ≤ 67), and low (GH >67) mortality risk. The median OS values were 14.5, 8.2, and 5.3 months in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories, respectively (log-rank P <0.0001). In the high-risk group, doublet chemotherapy was not associated with favourable OS (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.49-1.003; P=0.052), whereas in the intermediate- and low-risk groups, doublet chemotherapy was associated with favourable OS (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.54-0.96; P=0.023 and HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.30-0.84; P=0.0089, respectively).--NEW SECTION--This study supports the additional prognostic value of HRQoL data at diagnosis to identify vulnerable subpopulations in elderly NSCLC patients.

Methods. MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, Healthstar, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, clinicaltrials.gov (inception to August 2015), and gray literature were searched. The strength of evidence was adjudicated using Oxford and GRADE methodology. Results. We identified 11 original articles. Twenty-one patients were described, with 13 adult and 8 pediatric. All studies were retrospective. Seizure reduction/control with rTMS occurred in 15 of the 21 patients (71.4%), with 5 (23.8%) and 10 (47.6%) displaying partial and complete responses, respectively. Seizures recurred after rTMS in 73.3% of the patients who had initially responded. All studies were an Oxford level 4, GRADE D level of evidence. Conclusions. Oxford level 4, GRADE D evidence exists to suggest a potential impact on seizure control with the use of rTMS for FSE and FRSE, though durability of the therapy is short-lived. Routine use of rTMS in this context cannot be recommended at this time.

Systematic and high-quality monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of such processes is rare. We propose a framework and related guiding questions to systematize the M&E of global health program transitions.--NEW SECTION--We conducted stakeholder interviews, searched the peer-reviewed and gray literature, gathered feedback from key informants, and reflected on author experiences to build a framework on M&E of transition and to develop guiding questions.--NEW SECTION--The conceptual framework models transition as a process spanning pre-transition and transition itself and extending into sustained services and outcomes. Key transition domains include leadership, financing, programming, and service delivery, and relevant activities that drive the transition in these domains forward include sustaining a supportive policy environment, creating financial sustainability, developing local stakeholder capacity, communicating to all stakeholders, and aligning programs. Ideally transition monitoring would begin prior to transition processes being implemented and continue for some time after transition has been completed. As no set of indicators will be applicable across all types of health program transitions, we instead propose guiding questions and illustrative quantitative and qualitative indicators to be considered and adapted based on the transition domains identified as most important to the particular health program transition. The M&E of transition faces new and unique challenges, requiring measuring constructs to which evaluators may not be accustomed. Many domains hinge on measuring ""intangibles"" such as the management of relationships. Monitoring these constructs may require a compromise between rigorous data collection and the involvement of key stakeholders.--NEW SECTION--Monitoring and evaluating transitions in global health programs can bring conceptual clarity to the transition process, provide a mechanism for accountability, facilitate engagement with local stakeholders, and inform the management of transition through learning.

Demand and interest in global health among Canadian students is well documented, despite the difficulty in integrating meaningful experiences into curricula.--NEW SECTION--Global health advocacy was taught to 19 undergraduate students at McMaster University through an experiential education course, during which they developed a national advocacy campaign on global access to medicines. A quantitative survey and an analysis of social network dynamics were conducted, along with a qualitative analysis of written work and course evaluations. Data were interpreted through a thematic synthesis approach.--NEW SECTION--Themes were identified related to students' learning outcomes, experience and class dynamics. The experiential education format helped students gain authentic, real-world experience in global health advocacy and leadership. The tangible implications for their course work was a key motivating factor. While experiential education is an effective tool for some learning outcomes, it is not suitable for all. As well, group dynamics and evaluation methods affect the learning environment.--NEW SECTION--Real-world global health issues, public health practice and advocacy approaches can be effectively taught through experiential education, alongside skills like communication and professionalism.

Innovative MNH approaches have the potential to accelerate progress and to lead to better health outcomes for women and newborns, but their added value to health systems remains incompletely understood. This study's aim was to analyze the landscape of innovative MNH approaches and related published evidence.--NEW SECTION--Systematic literature review and descriptive analysis based on the MNH continuum of care framework and the World Health Organization health system building blocks, analyzing the range and nature of currently published MNH approaches that are considered innovative. We used 11 databases (MedLine, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane, Popline, BLDS, ELDIS, 3ie, CAB direct, WHO Global Health Library and WHOLIS) as data source and extracted data according to our study protocol.--NEW SECTION--Most innovative approaches in MNH are iterations of existing interventions, modified for contexts in which they had not been applied previously. Many aim at the direct organization and delivery of maternal and newborn health services or are primarily health workforce interventions. Innovative approaches also include health technologies, interventions based on community ownership and participation, and novel models of financing and policy making. Rigorous randomized trials to assess innovative MNH approaches are rare; most evaluations are smaller pilot studies. Few studies assessed intervention effects on health outcomes or focused on equity in health care delivery.--NEW SECTION--Future implementation and evaluation efforts need to assess innovations' effects on health outcomes and provide evidence on potential for scale-up, considering cost, feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability. Measuring equity is an important aspect to identify and target population groups at risk of service inequity. Innovative MNH interventions will need innovative implementation, evaluation and scale-up strategies for their sustainable integration into health systems.",eng,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Most hospitals reported capacity to provide general anaesthesia, though few hospitals reported having at least one certified surgeon, obstetrician and anaesthesiologist. Access to anaesthetic machines, pulse oximetry and blood bank was severely limited. Many non-hospital health centres providing basic surgical procedures, but almost none had uninterrupted access to electricity, running water, oxygen and basic supplies for resuscitation, airway management and obstetric services.--NEW SECTION--Capacity for essential surgery and anaesthesia services is severely limited in PNG due to shortfalls in physical infrastructure, human resources, and basic equipment and supplies.

Although, I agree with the authors' central premise about the important role of management in improving global health and concur that focusing on competencies can guide management capacity building, I think it is important to recognize that a set of relevant competencies is not the only way to conceptualize and organize efforts to teach, learn, practice, or conduct research on management.

A recent progress review of the Global Vaccine Action Plan stated that ""countries should urgently identify barriers and bottlenecks and implement targeted approaches to increase and sustain coverage"". However, vaccination coverage may be determined by a complex mix of demographic, structural, social and behavioral factors. To develop a practical taxonomy to organise the myriad possible root causes of a gap in vaccination coverage rates, we performed a narrative review of the literature and tested whether all non-socio-demographic determinants of coverage could be organised into 4 dimensions: Access, Affordability, Awareness and Acceptance. Forty-three studies were reviewed, from which we identified 23 primary determinants of vaccination uptake. We identified a fifth domain, Activation, which captured interventions such as SMS reminders which effectively nudge people towards getting vaccinated. The 5As taxonomy captured all identified determinants of vaccine uptake. This intuitive taxonomy has already facilitated mutual understanding of the primary determinants of suboptimal coverage within inter-sectorial working groups, a first step towards them developing targeted and effective solutions.",eng,Vaccine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Here, we report the discovery of inhibitors that target multiple stages of malaria parasite growth. To identify these inhibitors, we took advantage of the Tres Cantos Antimalarial Compound Set (TCAMS) small-molecule library, which is comprised of diverse and potent chemical scaffolds with activities against the blood stage of the malaria parasite, and investigated their effects against the elusive liver stage of the malaria parasite using a forward chemical screen. From a screen of nearly 14,000 compounds, we identified and confirmed 103 compounds as dual-stage malaria inhibitors. Interestingly, these compounds show preferential inhibition of parasite growth in liver- versus blood-stage malaria parasite assays, highlighting the drug susceptibility of this parasite form. Mode-of-action studies were completed using genetically modified and drug-resistant Plasmodium parasite strains. While we identified some compound targets as classical antimalarial pathways, such as the mitochondrial electron transport chain through cytochrome bc1 complex inhibition or the folate biosynthesis pathway, most compounds induced parasite death through as yet unknown mechanisms of action. Importantly, the identification of new chemotypes with different modes of action in killing Plasmodium parasites represents a promising opportunity for probing essential and novel molecular processes that remain to be discovered.

26659913,10.1093/ntr/ntv271,Group Waterpipe Tobacco Smoking Increases Smoke Toxicant Concentration.,"Waterpipe tobacco smoking is a global health concern. Laboratory research has focused on individual waterpipe users while group use is common. This study examined user toxicant exposure and smoke toxicant yield associated with individual and group waterpipe smoking.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-two pairs of waterpipe smokers used a waterpipe individually and as a dyad. Before and after smoking, blood was sampled and expired carbon monoxide (CO) measured; puff topography was recorded throughout. One participant from each pair was selected randomly and their plasma nicotine and expired air CO concentrations were compared when smoking alone to when smoking as part of a dyad. Recorded puff topography was used to machine-produce smoke that was analyzed for toxicant content.--NEW SECTION--There was no difference in mean plasma nicotine concentration when an individual smoked as part of a dyad (mean = 14.9 ng/ml; standard error of the mean [SEM] = 3.0) compared to when smoking alone (mean = 10.0 ng/ml; SEM = 1.5). An individual smoking as part of as a dyad had, on average, lower CO (mean = 15.8 ppm; SEM = 2.0) compared to when smoking alone (mean= 21.3 ppm; SEM = 2.7). When two participants smoked as a dyad they took, on average, more puffs (mean = 109.8; SEM = 7.6) than a singleton smoker (mean = 77.7; SEM = 8.1) and a shorter interpuff interval (IPI; dyad mean = 23.8 seconds; SEM = 1.9; singleton mean = 40.8 seconds; SEM = 4.8). Higher concentrations of several toxicants were observed in dyad-produced smoke.--NEW SECTION--Dyad smoking may increase smoke toxicant content, likely due to the dyad's shorter IPIs and greater puff number. More work is needed to understand if group waterpipe smoking alters the health risks of waterpipe tobacco smoking.--NEW SECTION--This study is the first to measure toxicants in smoke generated from a waterpipe when used by a dyad. Relative to smoke generated by a singleton, dyad smoke had higher concentration of some toxicants.

Industry or non-industry sponsorship may have a major influence in this mapping. We aimed to map the global landscape of industry- and non-industry-sponsored clinical trials and its evolution over time.--NEW SECTION--We analyzed clinical trials initiated between 2006 and 2013 and registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We mapped single-country and international trials by World Bank's income groups and by sponsorship (industry- vs. non- industry), including its evolution over time from 2006 to 2012. We identified clusters of countries that collaborated significantly more than expected in industry- and non-industry-sponsored international trials.--NEW SECTION--119,679 clinical trials conducted in 177 countries were analysed. The median number of trials per million inhabitants in high-income countries was 100 times that in low-income countries (116.0 vs. 1.1). Industry sponsors were involved in three times more trials per million inhabitants than non-industry sponsors in high-income countries (75.0 vs. 24.5) and in ten times fewer trials in low- income countries (0.08 vs. 1.08). Among industry- and non-industry-sponsored trials, 30.3% and 3.2% were international, respectively. In the industry-sponsored network of collaboration, Eastern European and South American countries collaborated more than expected; in the non-industry-sponsored network, collaboration among Scandinavian countries was overrepresented. Industry-sponsored international trials became more inter-continental with time between 2006 and 2012 (from 54.8% to 67.3%) as compared with non-industry-sponsored trials (from 42.4% to 37.2%).--NEW SECTION--Based on trials registered in the WHO ICTRP we documented a substantial gap between the globalization of industry- and non-industry-sponsored clinical research. Only 3% of academic trials but 30% of industry trials are international. The latter appeared to be conducted in preferentially selected countries.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In total, they consulted 823 patients with chronic illness. The CARE Measure and PEI scores were compared amongst doctors in these clinics with different training background: family medicine training, internal medicine training and those without specialist training. Generalized estimation equation (GEE) was used to account for cluster effects of patients nested with doctors.--NEW SECTION--Within similar clinic settings, FM trained doctors had higher CARE score than doctors with no FM training. In hospital clinics, the difference of the mean CARE score for doctors who had family medicine training (39.2, SD = 7.04) and internal medicine training (35.5, SD = 8.92) was statistically significant after adjusting for consultation time and gender of the patient. In the community care clinics, the mean CARE score for doctors with family medicine training and those without specialist training were 32.1 (SD = 7.95) and 29.2 (SD = 7.43) respectively, but the difference was not found to be significant. For PEI, patients receiving care from doctors in the hospital clinics scored significantly higher than those in the community clinics, but there was no significant difference in PEI between patients receiving care from doctors with different training backgrounds within similar clinic setting.--NEW SECTION--Family medicine training was associated with higher patient perceived empathy for chronic illness patients in the hospital clinics. Patient enablement appeared to be associated with clinic settings but not doctors' training background. Training in family medicine and a clinic environment that enables more patient doctor time might help in enhancing doctors' empathy and enablement for chronic illness patients.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

There is good information on the need for drugs for these diseases but until now, no global estimate of the impact drugs are having on this burden. This paper presents a model measuring companies' key malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS drugs' consequences for global health (global-health-impact.org). It aggregates drugs' impacts in several ways-by disease, country and originator-company. The methodology can be extended across diseases as well as drugs to provide a more extensive picture of the impact companies' drugs are having on the global burden of disease. The study suggests that key malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS drugs are, together, ameliorating about 37% of the global burden of these diseases and Sanofi, Novartis, and Pfizer's drugs are having the largest effect on this burden. Moreover, drug impacts vary widely across countries.

HMGB1 is comprised of two tandem HMG boxes (the A box and the B box) containing DNA-binding domains and an acidic C-terminal peptide. It has been reported that HMGB1 enhances viral replication by binding to viral proteins. However, its role in hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication is unknown. Here, we show that HMGB1 promoted HCV replication but had no effect on HCV translation. RNA immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the positive strand, not the negative strand, of HCV RNA interacted with HMGB1. HCV infection triggered HMGB1 protein translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, in which it interacted with the HCV genome. Moreover, the A box of HMGB1 is the pivotal domain to interact with stem-loop 4 (SL4) of the HCV 5' untranslated region. Deletion of the HMGB1 A box abrogated the enhancement of HCV replication by HMGB1. Our data suggested that HMGB1 serves as a proviral factor of HCV to facilitate viral replication in hepatocytes by interaction with the HCV genome.--NEW SECTION--Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global health threat, affecting more than 170 million people infection worldwide. These patients are at high risk of developing severe liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, no vaccine is available. Many host factors may be implicated in the pathogenesis of HCV-related diseases. In this study, we found a novel HCV RNA-binding protein, HMGB1, that promotes HCV RNA replication. Moreover, SL4 in the 5' untranslated region of the HCV genome is the key region for HMGB1 binding, and the A box of HMGB1 protein is the functional domain to interact with HCV RNA and enhance viral replication. HMGB1 appears to play an important role in HCV-related diseases, and further investigation is warranted to elucidate the specific actions of HMGB1 in HCV pathogenesis.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

There have been no major advances for the treatment of UBC in the last 30 years. In this study, we attempted to discover novel candidate therapeutic biomarkers for UBC. We utilized a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS-based proteomic method to compare and identify differentially expressed proteins in UBC and adjacent normal tissues. Thirty five differentially expressed proteins (over 2-fold, p<0.05) were identified. Further cluster analysis revealed these proteins were mainly involved in metabolism, apoptosis regulation, calcium ion binding and so on. Among them, phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), significantly up-regulated in UBC, was selected for detailed analysis. Immunohistochemical data showed that increased expression of PGAM1 was correlated with the severity of histological grade. Knockdown of PGAM1 expression by RNAi contributed to a marked antitumor activity in vivo. Moreover, we found, upon attenuation of PGAM1, its substrate 3-PG (3-phosphoglycerate) was up-regulated and product 2-PG (2-phosphoglycerate) was down-regulated, which consequently inhibited aerobic glycolysis and oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that are essential to cancer cell proliferation. Our finding showed that PGAM1 might serve as a promising therapeutic target for UBC.",eng,Journal of proteomics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Herein, we propose an approach to compare GHIs with regard to their main purpose and operational aspects, using the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR/WHO) as a case study. The overall goal is to identify synergies and optimize efforts to provide solutions to reduce the burden of diseases.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-six long-established GHIs were identified from among initiatives previously associated/partnered with TDR/WHO. All GHIs had working streams that would benefit from linking to the capacity building or implementation research focus of TDR. Individual profiles were created using a common template to collect information on relevant parameters. For analytical purposes, GHIs were simultaneously clustered in five and eight groups according to their 'intended outcome' and 'operational framework', respectively. A set of specific questions was defined to assess coherence/alignment against a TDR reference profile by attributing a score, which was subsequently averaged per GHI cluster. GHI alignment scores for intended outcome were plotted against scores for operational framework; based on the analysis of coherence/alignment with TDR functions and operations, a risk level (high, medium or low) of engagement was attributed to each GHI.--NEW SECTION--The process allowed a bi-dimensional ranking of GHIs with regards to how adequately they fit with or match TDR features and perspectives. Overall, more consistence was observed with regard to the GHIs' main goals and expected outcomes than with their operational aspects, reflecting the diversity of GHI business models. Analysis of coherence indicated an increasing common trend for enhancing the engagement of developing country stakeholders, building research capacity and optimization of knowledge management platforms in support of improved access to healthcare.--NEW SECTION--The process used offers a broader approach that could be adapted by other GHIs to build coherence and synergy with peer organizations and helps highlight the potential contribution of each GHI in the new era of sustainable development goals.

The infection can cause acute and chronic liver disease including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). On the basis of disease burden and the availability of safe and effective vaccines, World Health Organization has recommended that hepatitis B vaccine be incorporated into routine infant and childhood immunization programs for all countries. The efficacy of universal immunization has been proven in many countries, with substantial reductions of the prevalence of HBV carriage in children, adolescents and young adults. Most important, hepatitis B vaccination can protect them from HCC, as has been demonstrated in Taiwan and other countries. Nevertheless, the implementation of worldwide vaccination against HBV indeed requires more effort to overcome the social and economic challenges. To have a global control of HBV infection, we have to continue the universal HBV vaccination, interrupt the possible transmission routes and treat eligible patients with antiviral agents. However, current treatments are still far from ideal as they cannot eradicate intrahepatic HBV cccDNA, and lifelong administration of these agents will pose a major economic burden, especially in the endemic Asia-Pacific region.

The identification of key urate transporters such as urate transporter 1 and glucose transporter 9 has provided not only insights into the pathophysiology of hyperuricemia, but also possible links to other processes, such as glucose homeostasis. The renewed interest in the role of SUA in CKD has coincided with the development of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes. In addition to improving glycemic control, these agents, acting via the kidneys in an insulin-independent manner, have also been shown to reduce SUA levels and potentially improve some measures of renal function.

26649827,10.1038/nature16451,Unique role for ATG5 in neutrophil-mediated immunopathology during M. tuberculosis infection.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major global health threat, replicates in macrophages in part by inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion, until interferon-γ (IFNγ) activates the macrophage to traffic M. tuberculosis to the lysosome. How IFNγ elicits this effect is unknown, but many studies suggest a role for macroautophagy (herein termed autophagy), a process by which cytoplasmic contents are targeted for lysosomal degradation. The involvement of autophagy has been defined based on studies in cultured cells where M. tuberculosis co-localizes with autophagy factors ATG5, ATG12, ATG16L1, p62, NDP52, BECN1 and LC3 (refs 2-6), stimulation of autophagy increases bacterial killing, and inhibition of autophagy increases bacterial survival. Notably, these studies reveal modest (~1.5-3-fold change) effects on M. tuberculosis replication. By contrast, mice lacking ATG5 in monocyte-derived cells and neutrophils (polymorponuclear cells, PMNs) succumb to M. tuberculosis within 30 days, an extremely severe phenotype similar to mice lacking IFNγ signalling. Importantly, ATG5 is the only autophagy factor that has been studied during M. tuberculosis infection in vivo and autophagy-independent functions of ATG5 have been described. For this reason, we used a genetic approach to elucidate the role for multiple autophagy-related genes and the requirement for autophagy in resistance to M. tuberculosis infection in vivo. Here we show that, contrary to expectation, autophagic capacity does not correlate with the outcome of M. tuberculosis infection. Instead, ATG5 plays a unique role in protection against M. tuberculosis by preventing PMN-mediated immunopathology. Furthermore, while Atg5 is dispensable in alveolar macrophages during M. tuberculosis infection, loss of Atg5 in PMNs can sensitize mice to M. tuberculosis. These findings shift our understanding of the role of ATG5 during M. tuberculosis infection, reveal new outcomes of ATG5 activity, and shed light on early events in innate immunity that are required to regulate disease pathology and bacterial replication.",eng,Nature,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

A qualitative study on attitudes toward the practice among young Somalis in the Oslo area.,"Female genital mutilation or female circumcision (FC) is increasingly visible on the global health and development agenda - both as a matter of social justice and equality for women and as a research priority. Norway is one of the global nations hosting a large number of immigrants from FC-practicing countries, the majority from Somalia. To help counteract this practice, Norway has adopted a multifaceted policy approach that employs one of the toughest measures against FC in the world. However, little is known about the impact of Norway's approach on the attitudes toward the practice among traditional FC-practicing communities in Norway. Against this background, this qualitative study explores the attitudes toward FC among young Somalis between the ages of 16 to 22 living in the Oslo and Akershus regions of Norway. Findings indicate that young Somalis in the Oslo area have, to a large extent, changed their attitude toward the practice. This was shown by the participants' support and sympathy toward criminalization of FC in Norway, which they believed was an important step toward saving young girls from the harmful consequences of FC. Most of the uncircumcised girls see their uncircumcised status as being normal, whereas they see circumcised girls as survivors of violence and injustice. Moreover, the fact that male participants prefer a marriage to uncircumcised girls is a strong condition for change, since if uncut girls are seen as marriageable then parents are unlikely to want to circumcise them. As newly arrived immigrants continue to have positive attitudes toward the practice, knowledge of FC should be integrated into introduction program classes that immigrants attend shortly after their residence permit is granted. This study adds to the knowledge of the process of the abandonment of FC among immigrants in Western countries.",eng,International journal of women's health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26648707,10.2147/COPD.S87696,COPD: it is time to change!,"COPD is a common cause of disability, morbidity and mortality worldwide and a major global health problem with enormous direct and indirect health care costs. Different reasons can be advanced to explain it, but among them the possibility that the recommended diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to COPD were less effective than they could be, should be also considered. The pharmacological baseline treatment of stable COPD has been widely based on the severity of airflow obstruction and recently, of chronic symptoms and on the annual number of previous exacerbations. These recommendations do not take into account the underlying prevalent disease that should be treated and the future risk. Our suggestion is that the therapy must be firstly tailored on the prevalent disease leading to COPD, independently from the degree of FEV1 reduction and chronic dyspnea and only after that, according to the severity of the disorder (and age of patient), to establish the level of the treatment in order to freeze, when possible, and not to follow the underlying pathological process, running after it. Moreover, given the relevance of exacerbations in the natural history of COPD, greater effort should be placed on recognition of their prevalent type in frequent exacerbators and to prevent them using more tailored and specific treatment.",eng,International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This phase III trial prospectively assessed whether continued irreversible ErbB-family blockade with afatinib plus paclitaxel has superior outcomes versus switching to chemotherapy alone in patients acquiring resistance to erlotinib/gefitinib and afatinib monotherapy.--NEW SECTION--Patients with relapsed/refractory disease following ≥1 line of chemotherapy, and whose tumors had progressed following initial disease control (≥12 weeks) with erlotinib/gefitinib and thereafter afatinib (50 mg/day), were randomized 2:1 to receive afatinib plus paclitaxel (40 mg/day; 80 mg/m(2)/week) or investigator's choice of single-agent chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Other end points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), safety and patient-reported outcomes.--NEW SECTION--Two hundred and two patients with progressive disease following clinical benefit from afatinib were randomized to afatinib plus paclitaxel (n = 134) or single-agent chemotherapy (n = 68). PFS (median 5.6 versus 2.8 months, hazard ratio 0.60, P = 0.003) and ORR (32.1% versus 13.2%, P = 0.005) significantly improved with afatinib plus paclitaxel. There was no difference in OS. Global health status/quality of life was maintained with afatinib plus paclitaxel over the entire treatment period. The median treatment duration was 133 and 51 days with afatinib plus paclitaxel and single-agent chemotherapy, respectively; 48.5% of patients receiving afatinib plus paclitaxel and 30.0% of patients receiving single-agent chemotherapy experienced drug-related grade 3/4 adverse events. Treatment-related adverse events were consistent with those previously reported with each agent.--NEW SECTION--Afatinib plus paclitaxel improved PFS and ORR compared with single-agent chemotherapy in patients who acquired resistance to erlotinib/gefitinib and progressed on afatinib after initial benefit.

Patients (N = 138) with colorectal cancer were recruited from a district hospital in southern Taiwan. Data were collected using a self-report questionnaire. Questionnaire scales included the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Taiwan Form, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 Version 3 in Chinese as well as a demographic and disease-related variables datasheet. Descriptive data were presented using percentage, mean, and standard deviation. Chi-square test, independent t-test, one-way ANOVA, and hierarchical multiple regression were used for inferential statistics.--NEW SECTION--The post-treatment group showed a significantly higher average global health QOL score (68.68 vs. 59.54; p < .05). Hierarchical regression showed that the impact factor of quality of life has a depressive effect in many dimensions. The second most significant variable was symptom distress. Symptoms interfered with life activity functions and family income and impacted negatively on patient treatment. In survivorship, depressive tendencies was the variable that was most affected, followed by recurrence, symptoms interference, and surgical treatment, respectively. When controlling for the relevant variables, these predictors accounted for 38.5% and 40.9% of the total variance of global health quality of life.--NEW SECTION--This study demonstrates that personal characteristics variables, depressive tendencies, and symptom distress all impact on the quality of life of colorectal cancer patients in terms of receiving treatment and survivorship.

Adriamycin- (ADR-) induced rodent chronic nephropathy is a classic experimental model of human minimal lesion nephrotic syndrome. The present study investigated the effect of cobrotoxin (CTX) on ADR-induced nephropathy. Rats were given 6 mg/kg ADR once through the tail vein to replicate ADR nephropathy model. CTX was administered to rats daily by placing a fast dissolving CTX membrane strip under the tongue starting from 5 days prior to ADR administration until the end of experiment. The results showed that CTX ameliorated the symptoms of ADR nephropathy syndrome with reduced body weight loss, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, dyslipidemia, serum electrolyte imbalance, oxidative stress, renal function abnormities, and kidney pathological lesions. Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 expression was elevated after CTX administration in ADR nephropathy model. CTX inhibited the phosphorylation of IκB-α and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. Meanwhile, CTX upregulated the protein level of podocyte-specific nephrin and downregulated the level of fibrosis-related TGF-β.

We evaluated whether the high endogenous levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated acids (n-3 PUFA) in fat-1 transgenic mice could protect them against acute ethanol-induced liver steatosis. We induced alcoholic liver steatosis in 9-week-old male heterozygous fat-1 mice and their wild-type (WT) male littermates through three oral gavages of 60% ethanol at 4.7 g/kg body weight. Hepatic lipid accumulation was significantly increased in both alcohol treatment groups, but by much less in the fat-1 group compared with the WT group. Fat-1 mice exhibited significantly lower levels of total hepatic/plasma TG and plasma alanine aminotransferase activity. Accordingly, hepatic expression of lipogenesis-related genes (e.g., SREBP-1c, FAS, and SCD-1) and plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1) were reduced in the fat-1 mice. Furthermore, decreased hepatic expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and increased hepatic levels of PPAR-α and HO-1 were observed in the fat-1 mice, compared to the WT mice. These findings show that elevated tissue n-3 PUFA protect against acute ethanol-induced liver steatosis in fat-1 mice, possibly through the down-regulation of hepatic lipogenesis, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress.",eng,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

As a core method field in population health science and medicine, epidemiology is a growing scientific discipline that can analyze disease risk factors and develop statistical methodologies to maximize utilization of big data on populations and disease pathology. The evolving transdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) can advance biomedical and health research by linking exposures to molecular pathologic signatures, enhancing causal inference and identifying potential biomarkers for clinical impact. The MPE approach can be applied to any diseases, although it has been most commonly used in neoplastic diseases (including breast, lung and colorectal cancers) because of availability of various molecular diagnostic tests. However, use of state-of-the-art genomic, epigenomic and other omic technologies and expensive drugs in modern healthcare systems increases racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. To address this, we propose to integrate molecular pathology, epidemiology and social science. Social epidemiology integrates the latter two fields. The integrative social MPE model can embrace sociology, economics and precision medicine, address global health disparities and inequalities, and elucidate biological effects of social environments, behaviors and networks. We foresee advancements of molecular medicine, including molecular diagnostics, biomedical imaging and targeted therapeutics, which should benefit individuals in a global population, by means of an interdisciplinary approach of integrative MPE and social health science.",eng,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The mobility of infectious agents and their rapid adaptability, whether to climate change or socioeconomic drivers or both, demand the science employed to understand these processes be advanced and tailored to a country or a region, but with a global vision. In many parts of the world, largely because of economic struggles, scientific capacity has not kept pace with the need to accomplish this goal and has left these regions and hence the world vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks. To build scientific capability in a developing region requires cooperation and participation of experienced international scientists who understand the issues and are committed to educate the next generations of young investigators in the region. These efforts need to be coupled with the understanding and resolve of local governments and international agencies to promote an aggressive science agenda. International collaborative scientific investigation of infectious diseases not only adds significantly to scientific knowledge, but it promotes health security, international trust, and long-term economic benefit to the region involved. This premise is based on the observation that the most powerful human inspiration is that which brings peoples together to work on and solve important global challenges. The republics of the former Soviet Union provide a valuable case study for the need to rebuild scientific capacity as they are located at the crossroads where many of the world's great epidemics began. The scientific infrastructure and disease surveillance capabilities of the region suffered significant decline after the breakup of the Soviet Union. The U.S. Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program, a part of the U.S. Department of Defense, together with partner countries, have worked diligently to improve the capabilities in this region to guard against the potential future risk from especially dangerous pathogens. The dissolution of the Soviet Union left behind many scientists still working to study pathogens using antiquated protocols in unsafe laboratories. To address this situation, the CTR program began improving laboratory infrastructure, establishing biosafety and biosecurity programs, and training scientists in modern techniques, with emphasis on biosurveillance and safe containment of especially dangerous pathogens. In the Republic of Georgia, this effort culminated in the construction of a modern containment laboratory, the Richard G. Lugar Center for Public Health Research in Tbilisi to house both isolated especially dangerous pathogens as well as the research to be conducted on these agents. The need now is to utilize and sustain the investment made by CTR by establishing strong public and animal health science programs in these facilities tailored to the needs of the region and the goals for which this investment was made. A similar effort is ongoing in other former Soviet Republics. Here, we provide the analysis and recommendations of an international panel of expert scientists appointed by the Cooperative Biological Engagement Program of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to provide advice to the stakeholders on the scientific path for the future. The emphasis is on an implementation strategy for decision makers and scientists to consider providing a sustainable biological science program in support of the One Health initiative. Opportunities, potential barriers, and lessons learned while meeting the needs of the Republic of Georgia and the Caucasus region are discussed. It is hoped that this effort will serve as a model for similar scientific needs in not only the former Soviet Union republics but also other regions challenged by infectious diseases where the CTR program operates.",eng,Frontiers in public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26636066,10.3389/fpubh.2015.00269,Vaccines Through Centuries: Major Cornerstones of Global Health.,"Multiple cornerstones have shaped the history of vaccines, which may contain live-attenuated viruses, inactivated organisms/viruses, inactivated toxins, or merely segments of the pathogen that could elicit an immune response. The story began with Hippocrates 400 B.C. with his description of mumps and diphtheria. No further discoveries were recorded until 1100 A.D. when the smallpox vaccine was described. During the eighteenth century, vaccines for cholera and yellow fever were reported and Edward Jenner, the father of vaccination and immunology, published his work on smallpox. The nineteenth century was a major landmark, with the ""Germ Theory of disease"" of Louis Pasteur, the discovery of the germ tubercle bacillus for tuberculosis by Robert Koch, and the isolation of pneumococcus organism by George Miller Sternberg. Another landmark was the discovery of diphtheria toxin by Emile Roux and its serological treatment by Emil Von Behring and Paul Ehrlih. In addition, Pasteur was able to generate the first live-attenuated viral vaccine against rabies. Typhoid vaccines were then developed, followed by the plague vaccine of Yersin. At the beginning of World War I, the tetanus toxoid was introduced, followed in 1915 by the pertussis vaccine. In 1974, The Expanded Program of Immunization was established within the WHO for bacille Calmette-Guerin, Polio, DTP, measles, yellow fever, and hepatitis B. The year 1996 witnessed the launching of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. In 1988, the WHO passed a resolution to eradicate polio by the year 2000 and in 2006; the first vaccine to prevent cervical cancer was developed. In 2010, ""The Decade of vaccines"" was launched, and on April 1st 2012, the United Nations launched the ""shot@Life"" campaign. In brief, the armamentarium of vaccines continues to grow with more emphasis on safety, availability, and accessibility.

A limited number of infectious agents account for most of these illnesses, raising the hope that advances in the treatment and prevention of these infections can have global health impact. The two most important parasitic causes of diarrheal disease are Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Both parasites infect predominantly the small intestine and colonize the lumen and epithelial surface, but do not invade deeper mucosal layers. This review discusses the therapeutic challenges, current treatment options, and drug development efforts against cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis. The goals of drug development against Cryptosporidium and Giardia are different. For Cryptosporidium, only one moderately effective drug (nitazoxanide) is available, so novel classes of more effective drugs are a high priority. Furthermore, new genetic technology to identify potential drug targets and better assays for functional evaluation of these targets throughout the parasite life cycle are needed for advancing anticryptosporidial drug design. By comparison, for Giardia, several classes of drugs with good efficacy exist, but dosing regimens are suboptimal and emerging resistance begins to threaten clinical utility. Consequently, improvements in potency and dosing, and the ability to overcome existing and prevent new forms of drug resistance are priorities in antigiardial drug development. Current work on new drugs against both infections has revealed promising strategies and new drug leads. However, the primary challenge for further drug development is the underlying economics, as both parasitic infections are considered Neglected Diseases with low funding priority and limited commercial interest. If a new urgency in medical progress against these infections can be raised at national funding agencies or philanthropic organizations, meaningful and timely progress is possible in treating and possibly preventing cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis.",eng,Frontiers in microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This is in many ways surprising. As demonstrated in the work of Deacon on the 'globalization of social policy', global social policy has been animated and debated not only at the multilateral level but at the regional level as well. But at least in the diplomatic literature, the importance of this regional dynamic (with a focus on diverse sites and actors and the pursuit of democratic control) has been missed. The objective of this article is to explore whether health diplomacy is catching up to this larger debate re-shaping the conceptualization and practice of diplomacy more generally. In some ways, the results may be counter-productive in that this shift may encourage an increasingly fragmented process. Yet, it may also point to some breakthroughs, with diplomats, acting as 'go to' personnel on the front lines of operational activity, enabling actors to integrate with one another to produce effective governance. In doing so, the regional dimension is given greater recognition as a component of health diplomacy, albeit in an uneven and sometimes awkward manner.

26631631,10.1126/scitranslmed.aad0522,Immune history profoundly affects broadly protective B cell responses to influenza.,"Generating a broadly protective influenza vaccine is critical to global health. Understanding how immune memory influences influenza immunity is central to this goal. We undertook an in-depth study of the B cell response to the pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine over consecutive years. Analysis of monoclonal antibodies generated from vaccine-induced plasmablasts demonstrated that individuals with low preexisting serological titers to the vaccinating strain generated a broadly reactive, hemagglutinin (HA) stalk-biased response. Higher preexisting serum antibody levels correlated with a strain-specific HA head-dominated response. We demonstrate that this HA head immunodominance encompasses poor accessibility of the HA stalk epitopes. Further, we show polyreactivity of HA stalk-reactive antibodies that could cause counterselection of these cells. Thus, preexisting memory B cells against HA head epitopes predominate, inhibiting a broadly protective response against the HA stalk upon revaccination with similar strains. Consideration of influenza exposure history is critical for new vaccine strategies designed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies.",eng,Science translational medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26629599,10.1289/ehp.1509777,Ischemic Heart Disease Mortality and Long-Term Exposure to Source-Related Components of U.S. Fine Particle Air Pollution.,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution exposure has been identified as a global health threat. However, the types and sources of particles most responsible are not yet known.--NEW SECTION--We sought to identify the causal characteristics and sources of air pollution underlying past associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality, as established in the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study-II cohort.--NEW SECTION--Individual risk factor data were evaluated for 445,860 adults in 100 U.S. metropolitan areas followed from 1982 through 2004 for vital status and cause of death. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated IHD mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for PM2.5, trace constituents, and pollution source-associated PM2.5, as derived from air monitoring at central stations throughout the nation during 2000-2005.--NEW SECTION--Associations with IHD mortality varied by PM2.5 mass constituent and source. A coal combustion PM2.5 IHD HR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.08) per microgram/cubic meter, versus an IHD HR = 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.02) per microgram/cubic meter PM2.5 mass, indicated a risk roughly five times higher for coal combustion PM2.5 than for PM2.5 mass in general, on a per microgram/cubic meter PM2.5 basis. Diesel traffic-related elemental carbon (EC) soot was also associated with IHD mortality (HR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.06 per 0.26-μg/m3 EC increase). However, PM2.5 from both wind-blown soil and biomass combustion was not associated with IHD mortality.--NEW SECTION--Long-term PM2.5 exposures from fossil fuel combustion, especially coal burning but also from diesel traffic, were associated with increases in IHD mortality in this nationwide population. Results suggest that PM2.5-mortality associations can vary greatly by source, and that the largest IHD health benefits per microgram/cubic meter from PM2.5 air pollution control may be achieved via reductions of fossil fuel combustion exposures, especially from coal-burning sources.--NEW SECTION--Thurston GD, Burnett RT, Turner MC, Shi Y, Krewski D, Lall R, Ito K, Jerrett M, Gapstur SM, Diver WR, Pope CA III. 2016.

Residency electives should aid residents in achieving outcomes in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competency domains. In this paper, the authors review existing literature and provide expert opinion to highlight how global health electives can complement traditional training programs to assist residents in achieving ACGME milestones, using emergency medicine residency as an example. Recommendations are provided for identifying exemplary global health electives and for the development of institutional global health elective curricula in order to facilitate milestone achievement. Global health electives can advance progress towards ACGME milestones; however, they may vary greatly in terms of potential for learner advancement. Electives should thus be rigorously vetted to ensure they meet standards that will facilitate this process. Given that milestones are a newly introduced tool for assessing resident educational achievement, very little research is available currently to directly determine impacts, and further study will be needed.",eng,International journal of emergency medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Nurse-midwife and obstetrician faculty coordinators were supported by faculty from multiple professions and specialties in curriculum review and simulation development and implementation. The primary goal of the resulting technology-enhanced simulations of normal physiologic birth and obstetric emergencies was to assist learners' development of interprofessional competencies related to communication, teamwork, and patient-centered care. Trainees included nurse-midwifery students; residents in obstetrics, pediatrics, and family medicine; medical students; and advanced practice nursing students in pediatrics. The diversity of participant types and learning levels provided benefits and presented challenges to effective scenario-based simulation design among numerous other theoretical and logistical considerations. This project revealed practical solutions informed by emerging health sciences and education research literature, faculty experience, and formal course evaluations by learners. Best practices in simulation development and implementation were incorporated, including curriculum revision grounded in needs assessment, case- and event-based clinical scenarios, optimization of fidelity, and ample time for participant debriefing. Adequate preparation and attention to detail increased the immersive experience and benefits of simulation. Suggestions for fidelity enhancement are provided with examples of simulation scenarios, a timeline for preparations, and discussion topics to facilitate meaningful learning by maternity and newborn care providers and trainees in clinical and academic settings. Pre- and postsimulation measurements of knowledge, skills, and attitudes are ongoing and not reported.

26623005,10.1177/2042018815611004,The obesity of bone.,"During the last decades, obesity and osteoporosis have become important global health problems, and the belief that obesity is protective against osteoporosis has recently come into question. In fact, some recent epidemiologic and clinical studies have shown that a high level of fat mass might be a risk factor for osteoporosis and fragility fractures. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain the complex relationship between adipose tissue and bone. Indeed, adipose tissue secretes various molecules, named adipokines, which are thought to have effects on metabolic, skeletal and cardiovascular systems. Moreover, fat tissue is one of the major sources of aromatase, an enzyme that synthesizes estrogens from androgen precursors, hormones that play a pivotal role in the maintenance of skeletal homeostasis, protecting against osteoporosis. Moreover, bone cells express several specific hormone receptors and recent observations have shown that bone-derived factors, such as osteocalcin and osteopontin, affect body weight control and glucose homeostasis. Thus, the skeleton is considered an endocrine target organ and an endocrine organ itself, likely influencing other organs as well. Finally, adipocytes and osteoblasts originate from a common progenitor, a pluripotential mesenchymal stem cell, which has an equal propensity for differentiation into adipocytes or osteoblasts (or other lines) under the influence of several cell-derived transcription factors. This review will highlight recent insights into the relationship between fat and bone, evaluating both potential positive and negative influences between adipose and bone tissue. It will also focus on the hypothesis that osteoporosis might be considered the obesity of bone.",eng,Therapeutic advances in endocrinology and metabolism,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26622329,10.3892/etm.2015.2506,Establishment of a new animal model of allergic rhinitis with biphasic sneezing by intranasal sensitization with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B.,"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a global health problem. The effectiveness of currently available medications is limited and therefore investigation for more effective drugs is essential. The aim of the present study was to establish a model of AR in guinea pigs that can be utilized for the further investigation of new drugs. Guinea pigs were intranasally sensitized with 1 µg Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) dissolved in 40 µl saline once daily for 14 days. One week after the last sensitization, the same treatment was applied intranasally once every four days for a total of 30 times. In the treatment group, terfenadine was administered orally 70 min before the 4th, 14th and 24th challenge. Sneezing and nasal scratching were evaluated following each of the 30 challenges. The quantity of antigen-specific antibodies in the serum was measured. Between the 19th and 30th challenges, the guinea pigs in the model group produced significant biphasic elevations in sneezing number, with peaks 10 min-2 h and 4-8 h after the SEB challenges. In addition, the guinea pigs produced significantly more sneezing in the first peak during the 19th to 30th challenges than during the first to 18th challenges (P<0.01). Terfenadine significantly inhibited the early- and late-phase sneezing at all challenge times. The serum levels of SEB-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E and IgG1 were higher in the model group in comparison with those in the control group (P<0.01). This experiment demonstrated that SEB can induce typical AR with biphasic sneezing in guinea pigs. Histamine may play an important role in the early- and the late-phase sneezing in the model of AR. This model can be potentially used for the investigation of new drugs.",eng,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Pseudoginsenoside-F11 (PF11) is an ocotillol-type saponin that is isolated from Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) and was shown to have neuroprotective effects to promote learning and memory and to antagonize the pharmacological effects of morphine. Furthermore, PF11 also shows protective effects against METH-induced neurotoxicity in mice. However, the effects of PF11 on METH-induced preference and dopamine (DA) release have not been defined.--NEW SECTION--We investigated the effects of PF11 administration on METH-induced hyperlocomotion and conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice. Subsequently, extracellular DA and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were determined in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice after co-administration of PF11 and METH using in vivo microdialysis analyses. Moreover, the effects of PF11 administration on the μ-opioid neuronal responses, DAMGO (μ-opioid receptor agonist; [D-Ala(2), N-MePhe(4), Gly-ol]-enkephalin)-induced hyperlocomotion and accumbal extracellular DA increase were investigated to elucidate how PF11 inhibits METH-induced dependence by dopaminergic neuronal hyperfunction.--NEW SECTION--Co-administration of PF11 and METH for 6 days attenuated METH-induced locomotor sensitization compared with treatment with METH alone. In the CPP test, PF11 administration also inhibited METH-induced place preference. In vivo microdialysis analyses indicated that co-administration of PF11 and METH for 7 days prevented METH-induced extracellular DA increase in the NAc and repeated PF11 administration with or without METH for 7 days increased extracellular GABA levels in the NAc, whereas single administration of PF11 did not. Furthermore, DAMGO-induced hyperlocomotion and accumbal extracellular DA increase were significantly inhibited by acute PF11 administration.--NEW SECTION--The present data suggest that PF11 inhibits METH-induced hyperlocomotion, preference, and accumbal extracellular DA increase by regulating GABAergic neurons and μ-opioid receptors.",eng,Psychopharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We tested whether idiographic measures increased prediction of global QOL beyond standard (nomothetic) measures of QOL components.--NEW SECTION--We administered the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-BLM30, and our own idiographic Quality of Life Appraisal Profile prior to RC. Idiographic measures included number of goal statements, distance from goal attainment, and ability to complete goal attainment activities. Multivariate linear regression was used to predict measures of global QOL and related constructs of life satisfaction and mental health.--NEW SECTION--Two hundred fiftheen patients reported a median of 8 (interquartile range [IQR] 6, 11) goals and half had an average goal attainment rating above 6.9 out of 10 (IQR 5.5, 8.2). On multivariable analysis, QLQ-C30 role functioning and QLQ-BLM30 future perspective explained 15.7% of the variability in preoperative global QOL. Including goal attainment and activity difficulty explained an additional 12% of global QOL variance. Smaller gains were seen on measures of global health, life satisfaction, mental health, and activity, suggesting that idiographic measures capture aspects of QOL distinct from health and functional status defined by nomothetic scales.--NEW SECTION--Idiographic assessment of QOL added to prediction of global QOL above and beyond health-related components measured using nomothetic instruments.

We assessed the effects of body mass index (BMI) on distal airway function and airway inflammation.--NEW SECTION--Impulse oscillometry (IOS) as a measure of distal airway function, together with spirometry, were assessed in adults with a range of different BMIs. Airway inflammation was assessed with the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and participants exhaled at various exhalation flows to determine alveolar and bronchial NO.--NEW SECTION--In total 34 subjects were enrolled in the study; 19 subjects had a normal BMI (18.50-24.99), whilst 15 subjects were overweight (BMI 25.00-29.99), or obese (BMI ≥30). All subjects had normal spirometry. However, IOS measures of airway resistance (R) at 5Hz, 20Hz and frequency dependence (R5-20) were elevated in overweight/obese individuals, compared to subjects with a normal BMI (median (interquartile range)); 5Hz: 0.41 (0.37, 0.45) vs. 0.32 (0.30, 0.37)kPa/l/s; 20Hz: 0.34 (0.30, 0.37) vs. 0.30 (0.26, 0.33)kPa/l/s; R5-20: 0.06 (0.04, 0.11) vs. 0.03 (0.01, 0.05)kPa/l/s; p<0.05), whereas airway reactance at 20Hz was decreased in overweight/obese individuals (20Hz: 0.07 (0.03, 0.09) vs. 0.10 (0.07, 0.13)kPa/l/s, p=0.009; 5Hz: -0.12 (-0.15, -0.10) vs. -0.10 (-0.13, -0.09)kPa/l/s, p=0.07). In contrast, within-breath IOS measures (a sign of expiratory flow limitation) and FeNO inflammatory measures, did not differ between groups (p>0.05).--NEW SECTION--Being overweight has significant effects on distal and central airway function as determined by IOS, which is not detected by spirometry. Obesity does not influence airway inflammation as measured by FeNO.

Lung fibroblasts have been shown to play a key role in lung inflammatory responses. However, their exact role in initiation and maintenance of lung diseases has remained elusive partly due to the limited availability of physiologically relevant in vitro models. Therefore, developing new tools that enable investigating the molecular pathways (e.g. nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation) that underpin inflammatory responses in fibroblasts could be a valuable resource for scientists working in this area of research.--NEW SECTION--In order to investigate NF-κB activation in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli in real-time, we first developed two detection systems based on nuclear localization of NF-κB by immunostaining and luciferase reporter assay system. Furthermore using electrospun porous scaffolds, with similar geometry to human lung extracellular matrix, we developed 3D cultures of lung fibroblasts allowing comparing NF-κB activation in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli (i.e. TNF-α) in 2D and 3D. Our data clearly show that the magnitude of NF-κB activation in 2D cultures is substantially higher than 3D cultures. However, unlike 2D cultures, cells in the 3D model remained responsive to TNF-α at higher concentrations. The more subdued and wider dynamic range of NF-κB responses in 3D culture system was associated with a different expression pattern for TNF receptor I in 3D versus 2D cultures collectively reflecting a more in vivo like TNF receptor I expression and NF-κB activation pattern in the 3D system.--NEW SECTION--Our data suggest that lung fibroblasts are actively involved in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation by activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. The 3D culture detection system provides a sensitive and biologically relevant tool for investigating different pro-inflammatory events involving lung fibroblasts.",eng,Respiratory research,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

The barriers to program development, along with the advantages and disadvantages of collaboration between nursing and medical schools, are reviewed. The clinical experience, consisting of 5 clinical shifts, was designed using the conceptual model of collaborative intelligence. A formal rotation with the midwife was constructed for the first-year resident on the labor and delivery unit, providing care to intrapartum and postpartum women and families. The program included didactic and clinical teaching, with an emphasis on the normal physiologic process of birth and introduction to the midwifery scope of practice and philosophy of care. Formative evaluation of the clinical rotation demonstrated strong interest for continuation of the program and an ability to appreciate midwifery components of care in a limited exposure. Moreover, program development was successful without requiring large curricular changes for the resident. Future planning includes expansion of the program with increased emphasis on the postpartum and breastfeeding woman and continued program evaluation. The long-term success of such collaborations will depend on the continued support of the American College of Nurse-Midwives and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in developing and improving interdisciplinary educational teams.

In this review we will discuss the features and current status of stroke in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Overall the global burden of hemorrhagic stroke is larger than ischemic stroke, with a disproportionately greater burden, measured in incidence and disability-adjusted life-years, regionally localized in LMICs. Patients in poorer countries suffer due to insufficient primary care needed to control risk factors such as hypertension, and inadequate emergency care systems through which sudden events should be managed. In light of these situations, we emphasize two strategic points for development assistance. First, assistance should be provided for bolstering, integrating, and coordinating both the primary health and emergency care systems, in order to prevent stroke and strengthen stroke management, respectively. Second, the assistance needs to focus on programs at the community level, to reduce life-style risks of stroke in a more sustainable manner, and to improve stroke outcomes more effectively.",eng,Journal of Korean medical science,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Because of the recent understanding of the biology of this disease, many candidate targets have come into light for therapeutic evaluation. The current review is about evaluating the preclinical and clinical aspects of BRAF as a therapeutic target in this disease. The available clinical results suggest that while the use of unselective RAF inhibitors (e.g., sorafenib) has been ineffective in the management of advanced CRC patients with KRAS mutation, combination of selective BRAF inhibitors plus EGFR inhibitors may represent a good therapeutic strategy in BRAF-mutant CRC.",eng,"Future oncology (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26616119,10.3310/hta19990,"Behaviour change techniques: the development and evaluation of a taxonomic method for reporting and describing behaviour change interventions (a suite of five studies involving consensus methods, randomised controlled trials and analysis of qualitative data).","Meeting global health challenges requires effective behaviour change interventions (BCIs). This depends on advancing the science of behaviour change which, in turn, depends on accurate intervention reporting. Current reporting often lacks detail, preventing accurate replication and implementation. Recent developments have specified intervention content into behaviour change techniques (BCTs) - the 'active ingredients', for example goal-setting, self-monitoring of behaviour. BCTs are 'the smallest components compatible with retaining the postulated active ingredients, i.e. the proposed mechanisms of change. They can be used alone or in combination with other BCTs' (Michie S, Johnston M. Theories and techniques of behaviour change: developing a cumulative science of behaviour change. Health Psychol Rev 2012;6:1-6). Domain-specific taxonomies of BCTs have been developed, for example healthy eating and physical activity, smoking cessation and alcohol consumption. We need to build on these to develop an internationally shared language for specifying and developing interventions. This technology can be used for synthesising evidence, implementing effective interventions and testing theory. It has enormous potential added value for science and global health.--NEW SECTION--(1) To develop a method of specifying content of BCIs in terms of component BCTs; (2) to lay a foundation for a comprehensive methodology applicable to different types of complex interventions; (3) to develop resources to support application of the taxonomy; and (4) to achieve multidisciplinary and international acceptance for future development.--NEW SECTION--Four hundred participants (systematic reviewers, researchers, practitioners, policy-makers) from 12 countries engaged in investigating, designing and/or delivering BCIs. Development of the taxonomy involved a Delphi procedure, an iterative process of revisions and consultation with 41 international experts; hierarchical structure of the list was developed using inductive 'bottom-up' and theory-driven 'top-down' open-sort procedures (n = 36); training in use of the taxonomy (1-day workshops and distance group tutorials) (n = 161) was evaluated by changes in intercoder reliability and validity (agreement with expert consensus); evaluating the taxonomy for coding interventions was assessed by reliability (intercoder; test-retest) and validity (n = 40 trained coders); and evaluating the taxonomy for writing descriptions was assessed by reliability (intercoder; test-retest) and by experimentally testing its value (n = 190).--NEW SECTION--Ninety-three distinct, non-overlapping BCTs with clear labels and definitions formed Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1). BCTs clustered into 16 groupings using a 'bottom-up' open-sort procedure; there was overlap between these and groupings produced by a theory-driven, 'top-down' procedure. Both training methods improved validity (both p < 0.05), doubled the proportion of coders achieving competence and improved confidence in identifying BCTs in workshops (both p < 0.001) but did not improve intercoder reliability. Good intercoder reliability was observed for 80 of the 93 BCTs. Good within-coder agreement was observed after 1 month (p < 0.001). Validity was good for 14 of 15 BCTs in the descriptions. The usefulness of BCTTv1 to report descriptions of observed interventions had mixed results.--NEW SECTION--The developed taxonomy (BCTTv1) provides a methodology for identifying content of complex BCIs and a foundation for international cross-disciplinary collaboration for developing more effective interventions to improve health. Further work is needed to examine its usefulness for reporting interventions.--NEW SECTION--This project was funded by the Medical Research Council Ref: G0901474/1.

Projections of rising greenhouse gas emissions suggest increasing direct and indirect burden of infectious and noninfectious disease, effects on food and water security, and other societal disruptions. As the effects of climate change cannot be isolated from social and ecological determinants of disease that will mitigate or exacerbate forecasted health outcomes, multidisciplinary collaboration is critically needed.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this article was to review the links between climate change and its upstream drivers (ie, processes leading to greenhouse gas emissions) and health outcomes, and identify existing opportunities to leverage more integrated global health and climate actions to prevent, prepare for, and respond to anthropogenic pressures.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a literature review of current and projected health outcomes associated with climate change, drawing on findings and our collective expertise to review opportunities for adaptation and mitigation across disciplines.--NEW SECTION--Health outcomes related to climate change affect a wide range of stakeholders, providing ready collaborative opportunities for interventions, which can be differentiated by addressing the upstream drivers leading to climate change or the downstream effects of climate change itself.--NEW SECTION--Although health professionals are challenged with risks from climate change and its drivers, the adverse health outcomes cannot be resolved by the public health community alone. A phase change in global health is needed to move from a passive responder in partnership with other societal sectors to drive innovative alternatives. It is essential for global health to step outside of its traditional boundaries to engage with other stakeholders to develop policy and practical solutions to mitigate disease burden of climate change and its drivers; this will also yield compound benefits that help address other health, environmental, and societal challenges.",eng,Annals of global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Bisphosphonates have been used to treat osteoporosis and have shown great success in conserving bone mass and reducing fracture incidence. In spite of the existing knowledge of the in vivo responses of bone to bisphosphonates, the cellular responses to these drugs have yet to be fully elucidated. In vitro model systems that allow the decoupling of complex highly integrated events, such as bone remodelling, provide a tool whereby these biological processes may be studied in a more simplified context. This study firstly utilised an in vitro model system of bone remodelling and comprising all three major cell types of the bone (osteocytes, osteoclasts and osteoblasts), which was representative of the bone's capacity to sense microdamage and subsequently initiate a basic multicellular unit response. Secondly, this system was used to study the effect of two commonly utilised aminobisphosphonate treatments for osteoporosis, alendronate and zoledronate. We demonstrated that microinjury to osteocyte networks being treated with bisphosphonates modulates receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand and osteoprotegerin activity, and subsequently osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, bisphosphonates increased the osteogenic potential following microinjury. Thus, we have shown for the first time that bisphosphonates act at all three stages of bone remodelling, from microinjury to osteoclastogenesis and ultimately osteogenesis.",eng,European cells & materials,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

As part of a Health Resources and Services Administration Advanced Nursing Education project, an interprofessional faculty and student team planned and implemented the first didactic coursework for nurse-midwifery and medical students at the University of California, San Francisco and responded to formative feedback in order to create a more meaningful educational experience for future combined cohorts. This article describes the process of including advanced nurse-midwifery students into 2 classes previously offered solely to medical students: 1) an elective in which students are matched with a pregnant woman to observe care that she receives before, during, and after giving birth; and 2) a required course on basic clinical care across the human lifespan. The development of these interprofessional courses, obstacles to success, feedback from students, and responses to course evaluations are reviewed. Themes identified in student course evaluations included uncertainty about interprofessional roles, disparity in clinical knowledge among learners, scheduling difficulties, and desire for more interprofessional education opportunities and additional time for facilitated interprofessional discussion. As a result of this feedback, more class time was designated for interprofessional exchange; less experienced rather than advanced midwifery students were included in both classes; and more interdisciplinary panel presentations were provided, along with clearer communication about student and clinician roles. Early project activities indicated nurse-midwifery students can be effectively included in existing medical student courses with revised curriculum and highlighted challenges that should be considered in the planning phase of similar projects in the future. This article is part of a special series of articles that address midwifery innovations in clinical practice, education, interprofessional collaboration, health policy, and global health.",eng,Journal of midwifery & women's health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This pandemic is primarily attributed to the surplus of nutrients and the increased prevalence of obesity worldwide. In contrast, calorie restriction and weight reduction can drastically prevent type 2 diabetes, indicating a central role of nutrient excess in the development of diabetes. Recently, the molecular links between excessive nutrients, organelle stress, and development of metabolic disease have been extensively studied. Specifically, excessive nutrients trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress and increase the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, leading to activation of stress signaling pathway, inflammatory response, lipogenesis, and pancreatic beta-cell death. Autophagy is required for clearance of hepatic lipid clearance, alleviation of pancreatic beta-cell stress, and white adipocyte differentiation. ROS scavengers, chemical chaperones, and autophagy activators have demonstrated promising effects for the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes in preclinical models.

We conducted this study to investigate HBV genotypes and antiviral resistant mutations in this multi-ethnic area. A total of 1316 HBV patients were recruited from four ethnic groups from 2011 to 2013. Genotypes and resistant mutations were determined by Sanger sequencing. Four genotypes (B, C, D and C/D) were identified. Genotype B and C were common in Han population, while genotype D was predominant in Uygurs. Genotype C was the major genotype in both Tibetans and Yis, and recombinant C/D was found in Tibetans only. Lamivudine resistance was common in all populations, especially in Hans with prevalence of 42.8%. Entecavir resistance was barely observed regardless of ethnicity. Genotype C isolates had higher rates of rtA181T/V than genotype B (13.5% vs. 5.1%, P < 0.001), in accordance with higher prevalence of resistance to adefovir (20.0% vs. 9.5%, P < 0.001). While incidence of resistant mutations to other drugs and clinical factors showed no difference among different genotypes.

We asked the question of why Germany has decided to establish a national policy framework for global health at this point in time, and how the development process has taken place. The ultimate goal of this study was to achieve better insights into the respective health and foreign policy processes at the national level. This article reports on the results of semi-structured interviews with those actors that were responsible for initiating and drafting the German Global Health Strategy (GGHS). Our study shows that a series of external developments, stakeholders, and advocacy efforts created an environment conducive to the creation of the strategic document. In addition, a number of internal considerations, struggles, and capacities played a decisive role during the development phase of the GGHS. Understanding these factors better can not only provide substantial insights into global health related policy processes in Germany, but also contribute to the general discourse on the role of the nation state in global health governance.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

A narrative review.,"The emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases are now more than ever considered threats to public health systems. There have been over 20 outbreaks of Ebola in the past 40 years. Only recently, the World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in West Africa, with a projected estimate of 1.2 million deaths expected in the next 6 months. Ebola virus is a highly virulent pathogen, often fatal in humans and non-human primates. Ebola is now a great priority for global health security and often becomes fatal if left untreated. This study employed a narrative review. Three major databases - MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Global Health - were searched using both 'text-words' and 'thesaurus terms'. Evidence shows that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are not coping well with the current challenges of Ebola, not only because they have poor and fragile systems but also because there are poor infectious disease surveillance and response systems in place. The identification of potential cases is problematic, particularly in the aspects of contact tracing, infection control, and prevention, prior to the diagnosis of the case. This review therefore aims to examine whether LMICs' health systems would be able to control and manage Ebola in future and identifies two key elements of health systems strengthening that are needed to ensure the robustness of the health system to respond effectively.",eng,Infection ecology & epidemiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In a more recent iteration, PEPFAR shifted its focus from an emergency response to more closely account for healthcare sustainability. This transition came on the heels of the 2008 financial crisis, which threatened to stall the 'marvellous momentum' of the 2000's boom in donor aid for global health overall. Now many programmes are having to do more with less as funding flattens or decreases. This paper examines how this transition took shape in Tanzania in 2011-2012, and the successes and challenges associated with it, using participant observation and interview data from 20 months of fieldwork in rural and urban healthcare settings. In particular, I discuss (1) efforts to increase sustainability and country ownership of HIV programmes in Tanzania, focusing on the shift from PEPFAR-funded American non-governmental organisations to Tanzanian partner organisations; (2) principal challenges stakeholders encountered during the transition, including fragmented systems of healthcare delivery and a weakened healthcare workforce; and (3) strategies informants identified to better integrate services in order to build a stronger, more equitable, and sustainable health system in Tanzania.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017
26609343,10.4254/wjh.v7.i26.2664,Challenges of liver cancer: Future emerging tools in imaging and urinary biomarkers.,"Chronic liver disease has become a global health problem as a result of the increasing incidence of viral hepatitis, obesity and alcohol misuse. Over the past three decades, in the United Kingdom alone, deaths from chronic liver disease have increased both in men and in women. Currently, 2.5% of deaths worldwide are attributed to liver disease and projected figures suggest a doubling in hospitalisation and associated mortality by 2020. Chronic liver diseases vary for clinical manifestations and natural history, with some individuals having relatively indolent disease and others with a rapidly progressive course. About 30% of patients affected by hepatitis C has a progressive disease and develop cirrhosis over a 20 years period from the infection, usually 5-10 years after initial medical presentation. The aim of the current therapeutic strategies is preventing the progression from hepatitis to fibrosis and subsequently, cirrhosis. Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for chronic liver disease and is affecting about the half of patients who abuse alcohol. Moreover non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is part of the metabolic syndrome, associated with obesity, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia, and a subgroup of patients develops non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis with subsequent cirrhosis. The strengths and pitfalls of liver biopsy are discussed and a variety of new techniques to assess liver damage from transient elastography to experimental techniques, such as in vitro urinary nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Some of the techniques and tests described are already suitable for more widespread clinical application, as is the case with ultrasound-based liver diagnostics, but others, such as urinary metabonomics, requires a period of critical evaluation or development to take them from the research arena to clinical practice.",eng,World journal of hepatology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This meta-analysis updates and goes beyond previous ones by answering two important questions: (1) do prenatal and postnatal nutritional inputs improve mental development, and (2) are effects on mental development associated with two theoretically interesting mediators namely physical growth and motor development? The meta-analysis of articles on Medline, PsycINFO, Global Health and Embase was limited to randomized trials in LMICs, with mental development of children from birth to age two years as an outcome. The initial yield of 2689 studies was reduced to 33; 12 received a global quality rating of strong. Of the 10 prenatal and 23 postnatal nutrition interventions, the majority used zinc, iron/folic acid, vitamin A or multiple micronutrients, with a few evaluating macronutrients. The weighted mean effect size, Cohen's d (95% CI) for prenatal and postnatal nutrition interventions on mental development was 0.042 (-0.0084, 0.092) and 0.076 (0.019, 0.13), respectively. Postnatal supplements consisting of macronutrients yielded an effect size d (95% CI) of 0.14 (0.0067, 0.27), multiple micronutrients 0.082 (-0.012, 0.18) and single micronutrients 0.058 (-0.0015, 0.12).

With the support of UNFPA and other partners, at least 15 countries in the region have introduced MDSR into maternal and newborn health care programs. The report from the knowledge-sharing meeting and the findings of the evaluation of the South African MDSR show that MDSR is still not at an optimal level in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, despite the efforts of national authorities and support from a number of development partners. Additional work is required on the part of national authorities, communities, and development organizations, and the challenges being faced were highlighted at the knowledge-sharing meeting.",eng,Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26606159,10.1111/jmwh.12373,Teaching Labor Support: An Interprofessional Simulation.,"Support for women during labor encompasses the continuous presence of a person who provides psychosocial, emotional, and physical support. Providing labor support to women in the intrapartum setting is a core midwifery competency and a clinical skill that midwifery students are expected to master. Instruction on labor support is a common objective in midwifery education intrapartum courses and skills labs, yet there is no standard for teaching this skill to midwifery students. Thus, in order to accomplish this objective, we created an interprofessional simulation on labor support that involves the use of a standardized patient, a written scenario, an interprofessional team of nursing and midwifery students, faculty observations, and a reflective debrief. The goals of the labor support simulation are to allow midwifery students the opportunity to practice intrapartum labor support techniques and interprofessional communication prior to entering the clinical setting. A postsimulation structured debrief allows for student learning and reflection. This article describes the design, planning, and implementation of this unique simulation experience.

26605990,10.1111/jmwh.12363,The Clinical Learning Dyad Model: An Innovation in Midwifery Education.,"There is a national shortage of women's health and primary care providers in the United States, including certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives. This shortage is directly related to how many students can be trained within the existing system. The current model of midwifery clinical training is based on apprenticeship, with one-on-one interaction between a student and preceptor. Thus, the number of newly trained midwifery providers is limited by the number of available and willing preceptors. The clinical learning dyad model (CLDM), which pairs 2 beginning midwifery students with one preceptor in a busy practice, addresses this problem. In addition, this model brings in a senior midwife student as a near-peer mentor when the students are first oriented into outpatient clinical practice. The model began as a pilot project to improve the quality of training and increase available student spots in clinical education. This article discusses the origins of the model, the specifics of its design, and the results of a midterm and one-year postintervention survey. Students and preceptors involved in this model identified several advantages to the program, including increased student accountability, enhanced socialization into the profession, improved learning, and reduced teaching burden on preceptors. An additional benefit of the CLDM is that students form a learning community and collaborate with preceptors to care for women in busy clinical settings. Challenges of the model will also be discussed. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the CLDM.

The use of Web-based technologies such as 3-dimensional (3D) virtual learning environments in interprofessional education is a relatively new phenomenon, which offers promise in helping students come together in online teams when face-to-face encounters are not possible. The purpose of this article is to present the experience of a nurse-midwifery education program in a Southeastern US university in delivering Web-based interprofessional education for nurse-midwifery and third-year medical students utilizing the Virtual Community Clinic Learning Environment (VCCLE). The VCCLE is a 3D, Web-based, asynchronous, immersive clinic environment into which students enter to meet and interact with instructor-controlled virtual patient and virtual preceptor avatars and then move through a classic diagnostic sequence in arriving at a plan of care for women throughout the lifespan. By participating in the problem-based management of virtual patients within the VCCLE, students learn both clinical competencies and competencies for interprofessional collaborative practice, as described by the Interprofessional Education Collaborative Core Competencies for Interprofessional Collaborative Practice.

26604994,10.3205/zma000994,Internationalizing Medical Education: The Special Track Curriculum 'Global Health' at Justus Liebig University Giessen.,"Internationalizing higher education is considered to be a major goal for universities in Germany and many medical students aspire to include international experiences into their academic training. However, the exact meaning of ""internationalizing"" medical education is still poorly defined, just as is the possible pedagogic impact and effects. Against this background, this article presents the special track curriculum on global health (in German: Schwerpunktcurriculum Global Health, short: SPC) at Justus Liebig University Giessen, which was established in 2011 as a comprehensive teaching program to integrate international perspectives and activities systematically into the clinical years of the medical curriculum. The report of the structure, content, didactic principles and participants' evaluations of the SPC is embedded into a larger discussion of the pedagogic value of a broad and interdisciplinary perspective on ""global health"" in medical education, that explicitly includes attention for health inequities, social determinants of health and the cultural dimensions of medicine and health abroad and ""at home"" (e.g. in relation to migration). We conclude that if properly defined, the emerging field of ""global health"" represents a didactically meaningful approach for adding value to medical education through internationalizing the curriculum, especially in regard to themes that despite of their uncontested value are often rather weak within medical education. The concrete curricular structures, however, have always to be developed locally. The ""SPC"" at Giessen University Medical School is only one possible way of addressing these globally relevant issues in one particular local academic setting.",eng,GMS Zeitschrift fur medizinische Ausbildung,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

About 185 million people are living with HCV, of which 80% are living in low and middle income countries. With the development of new highly effective treatments for HCV, it is considered that the eradication of HCV may only be one step away. The major problem with new treatment options is its high price. The price of sofosbuvir-based treatment for one patient in the United States is US$85000-110000, while the actual production cost of a 12 wk direct-acting antiviral regimen is less than US$250. Another major hindrance in HCV eradication is the lack of quality management of blood transfusion screens. Due to the lack of HCV screening, 75% of people in the United States with HCV infection are unaware of their positive HCV status.

To enable assessment of healthcare value in stroke management, an international standard set of patient-centered stroke outcome measures was defined for use in a variety of healthcare settings.--NEW SECTION--A modified Delphi process was implemented with an international expert panel representing patients, advocates, and clinical specialists in stroke outcomes, stroke registers, global health, epidemiology, and rehabilitation to reach consensus on the preferred outcome measures, included populations, and baseline risk adjustment variables.--NEW SECTION--Patients presenting to a hospital with ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage were selected as the target population for these recommendations, with the inclusion of transient ischemic attacks optional. Outcome categories recommended for assessment were survival and disease control, acute complications, and patient-reported outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes proposed for assessment at 90 days were pain, mood, feeding, selfcare, mobility, communication, cognitive functioning, social participation, ability to return to usual activities, and health-related quality of life, with mobility, feeding, selfcare, and communication also collected at discharge. One instrument was able to collect most patient-reported subdomains (9/16, 56%). Minimum data collection for risk adjustment included patient demographics, premorbid functioning, stroke type and severity, vascular and systemic risk factors, and specific treatment/care-related factors.--NEW SECTION--A consensus stroke measure Standard Set was developed as a simple, pragmatic method to increase the value of stroke care.

Resistant organisms in health-care and community settings pose a threat to survival rates from serious infections, including neonatal sepsis and health-care-associated infections, and limit the potential health benefits from surgeries, transplants, and cancer treatment. The challenge of simultaneously expanding appropriate access to antimicrobials, while restricting inappropriate access, particularly to expensive, newer generation antimicrobials, is unique in global health and requires new approaches to financing and delivering health care and a one-health perspective on the connections between pathogen transmission in animals and humans. Here, we describe the importance of effective antimicrobials.

Studies of the VCM-resistance mechanism and alternative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. We mutagenized S. aureus laboratory strains and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with ethyl methanesulfonate, and isolated mutants that exhibited high resistance to VCM (minimum inhibitory concentration = 32 μg/ml). These VCM-resistant strains were sensitive to linezolid and rifampicin, and partly to arbekacin and daptomycin. Beta-lactams had synergistic effects with VCM against these mutants. VCM-resistant strains exhibited a 2-fold increase in the cell wall thickness. Several genes were commonly mutated among the highly VCM-resistant mutants.

Most women (91.5%) in the studies had pre-eclampsia. Baseline serum magnesium concentrations were consistently <1 mmol/l across studies. Intravenous loading dose between 4 and 6 g was associated with a doubling of this baseline concentration half an hour after injection. Maintenance infusion of 1 g/hour consistently produced concentrations well below 2 mmol/l, whereas maintenance infusion at 2 g/hour and the Pritchard intramuscular regimen had higher but inconsistent probability of producing concentrations between 2 and 3 mmol/l. Volume of distribution of magnesium varied (13.65-49.00 l) but the plasma clearance was fairly similar (4.28-5.00 l/hour) across populations.--NEW SECTION--The profiles of Zuspan and Pritchard regimens indicate that the minimum effective serum magnesium concentration for eclampsia prophylaxis is lower than the generally accepted level.

26599510,10.1371/journal.pone.0143738,High Dietary Folate in Mice Alters Immune Response and Reduces Survival after Malarial Infection.,"Malaria is a significant global health issue, with nearly 200 million cases in 2013 alone. Parasites obtain folate from the host or synthesize it de novo. Folate consumption has increased in many populations, prompting concerns regarding potential deleterious consequences of higher intake. The impact of high dietary folate on the host's immune function and response to malaria has not been examined. Our goal was to determine whether high dietary folate would affect response to malarial infection in a murine model of cerebral malaria. Mice were fed control diets (CD, recommended folate level for rodents) or folic acid-supplemented diets (FASD, 10x recommended level) for 5 weeks before infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. Survival, parasitemia, numbers of immune cells and other infection parameters were assessed. FASD mice had reduced survival (p<0.01, Cox proportional hazards) and higher parasitemia (p< 0.01, joint model of parasitemia and survival) compared with CD mice. FASD mice had lower numbers of splenocytes, total T cells, and lower numbers of specific T and NK cell sub-populations, compared with CD mice (p<0.05, linear mixed effects). Increased brain TNFα immunoreactive protein (p<0.01, t-test) and increased liver Abca1 mRNA (p<0.01, t-test), a modulator of TNFα, were observed in FASD mice; these variables correlated positively (rs = 0.63, p = 0.01). Bcl-xl/Bak mRNA was increased in liver of FASD mice (p<0.01, t-test), suggesting reduced apoptotic potential. We conclude that high dietary folate increases parasite replication, disturbs the immune response and reduces resistance to malaria in mice. These findings have relevance for malaria-endemic regions, when considering anti-folate anti-malarials, food fortification or vitamin supplementation programs.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

(31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allows non-invasive probing of important liver metabolites. Recently, the adiabatic multi-echo spectroscopic imaging sequence with spherical k-space sampling (AMESING) was introduced at 7T, enabling acquisition of T2 information. T2-weighed averaging of the multiple echoes improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The purpose of our study was to implement AMESING MRSI of the liver at 3T and 7T, derive localized T2 information and compare T2-weighted average spectra in terms of SNR.--NEW SECTION--Ten male volunteers underwent 2D AMESING MRSI at 3T and 7T after a minimum four-hour fast. SNR was calculated for PC, PE, Pi, GPE, GPC and α-ATP using maximum peak amplitudes and the SD of the noise. Metabolite peak ratios were calculated after fitting in jMRUI. SNR values and peak ratios were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.--NEW SECTION--For the first time liver metabolites' T2 values at 7T were measured: PE (55.6±3.5 ms), PC (51.2±2.3 ms), Pi (46.4±1.1 ms), GPE (44.0±0.8 ms), GPC (50.4±0.8 ms) and α-ATP (18.2±0.4 ms). SNR gain using T2-weighted averaging at 7T resulted in a 1.2× SNR gain.

To date, however, there has been no report describing the regulation of JE progression using immunomodulatory tools for developing therapeutic strategies. We tested whether blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway would regulate JE progression using murine JE model.--NEW SECTION--Infected wild-type and 4-1BB-knockout (KO) mice were examined daily for mortality and clinical signs, and neuroinflammation in the CNS was evaluated by infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes and cytokine expression. In addition, viral burden, JEV-specific T cell, and type I/II IFN (IFN-I/II) innate responses were analyzed.--NEW SECTION--Blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway significantly increased resistance to JE and reduced viral burden in extraneural tissues and the CNS, rather than causing a detrimental effect. In addition, treatment with 4-1BB agonistic antibody exacerbated JE. Furthermore, JE amelioration and reduction of viral burden by blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway were associated with an increased frequency of IFN-II-producing NK and CD4(+) Th1 cells as well as increased infiltration of mature Ly-6C(hi) monocytes in the inflamed CNS. More interestingly, DCs and macrophages derived from 4-1BB KO mice showed potent and rapid IFN-I innate immune responses upon JEV infection, which was coupled to strong induction of PRRs (RIG-I, MDA5), transcription factors (IRF7), and antiviral ISG genes (ISG49, ISG54, ISG56). Further, the ablation of 4-1BB signaling enhanced IFN-I innate responses in neuron cells, which likely regulated viral spread in the CNS. Finally, we confirmed that blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway in myeloid cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) played a dominant role in ameliorating JE. In support of this finding, HSC-derived leukocytes played a dominant role in generating the IFN-I innate responses in the host.--NEW SECTION--Blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway ameliorates JE via divergent enhancement of IFN-II-producing NK and CD4(+) Th1 cells and mature Ly-6C(hi) monocyte infiltration, as well as an IFN-I innate response of myeloid-derived cells. Therefore, regulation of the 4-1BB signaling pathway with antibodies or inhibitors could be a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of JE.",eng,Journal of neuroinflammation,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This study seeks to identify possible explanations for the challenges WHO faces in addressing the broader determinants of health, and the potential opportunities for working across sectors.--NEW SECTION--This qualitative study used a mixed methods approach of semi-structured interviews and document review. Five interviewees were selected by stratified purposive sampling within a sampling frame of approximately 45 potential interviewees, and a targeted document review was conducted. All interviewees were senior WHO staff at the department director level or above. Thematic analysis was used to analyze data from interview transcripts, field notes, and the document review, and data coded during the analysis was analyzed against three central research questions. First, how does WHO conceptualize its mandate in global health? Second, what are the barriers and enablers to enhancing cross-sectoral collaboration between WHO and other intergovernmental organizations? Third, how do the dominant conceptual frames and the identified barriers and enablers to cross-sectoral collaboration interact?--NEW SECTION--Analysis of the interviews and documents revealed three main themes: 1) WHO's role must evolve to meet the global challenges and societal changes of the 21st century; 2) WHO's cross-sectoral engagement is hampered internally by a dominant biomedical view of health, and the prevailing institutions and incentives that entrench this view; and 3) WHO's cross-sectoral engagement is hampered externally by siloed areas of focus for each intergovernmental organization, and the lack of adequate conceptual frameworks and institutional mechanisms to facilitate engagement across siloes.--NEW SECTION--There are a number of external and internal pressures on WHO which have created an organizational culture and operational structure that focuses on a narrow, technical approach to global health, prioritizing disease-based, siloed interventions over more complex approaches that span sectors.

Most notably, RDTs for malaria have reached an unparalleled level of technological maturity and market penetration, and are now considered an important complement to standard microscopic methods of malaria diagnosis. However, the technical development of RDTs for other infectious diseases, and their uptake within the global health community as a core diagnostic modality, has been hindered by a number of extant challenges. These range from technical and biological issues, such as the need for better affinity agents and biomarkers of disease, to social, infrastructural, regulatory and economic barriers, which have all served to slow their adoption and diminish their impact. In order for the immunochromatographic RDT format to be successfully adapted to other disease targets, to see widespread distribution, and to improve clinical outcomes for patients on a global scale, these challenges must be identified and addressed, and the global health community must be engaged in championing the broader use of RDTs.",eng,Nanobiomedicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26592805,10.1002/anie.201509960,Total Synthesis and Structural Reassignment of Aspergillomarasmine A.,"The increase and spread of Gram-negative bacteria that resistant are to almost all currently available β-lactam antibiotics is a major global health problem. The primary cause for drug resistance is the acquisition of metallo-β-lactamases such as metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1). The fungal natural product aspergillomarasmine A (AMA), a fungal natural product, is an inhibitor of NDM-1 and has shown promising in vivo therapeutic potential in a mouse model infected with NDM-1-expressing Gram-negative bacteria. The first total synthesis and stereochemical configuration reassignment of aspergillomarasmine A is reported. The synthesis highlights a flexible route and an effective strategy to achieve the required oxidation state at a late stage. This modular route is amenable to the efficient preparation of analogues for the development of metallo-β-lactamase inhibitors to potentiate β-lactam antibiotics.",eng,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26592458,10.1016/j.toxicon.2015.11.014,Differential action of medically important Indian BIG FOUR snake venoms on rodent blood coagulation.,"Snakebite is a global health problem affecting millions of people. According to WHO, India has the highest mortality and/or morbidity due to snakebite. In spite of commendable research on Indian BIG FOUR venomous species; Naja naja and Bungarus caeruleus (elapid); Daboia russelii and Echis carinatus (viperid), no significant progress has been achieved in terms of diagnosis and management of biting species with appropriate anti-snake venom. Major hurdle is identification of offending species. Present study aims at differentiation of Indian BIG FOUR snake venoms based on their distinguish action on rodent blood coagulation. Assessment of coagulation alterations by elapid venoms showed negligible effect on re-calcification time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and factors assay (I, II, V, VIII and X) both in vitro and in vivo. However, viperid venoms demonstrated significant anticoagulant status due to their remarkable fibrinogen degradation potentials as supported by fibrinogenolytic activity, fibrinogen zymography and rotational thromboelastometry. Though results provide hint on probable alterations of Indian BIG FOUR snake venoms on blood coagulation, the study however needs validation from human victim's samples to ascertain its reliability for identification of biting snake species.",eng,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016

Depression, the most common mood disorder, is often found to be higher among people with chronic health conditions like bronchial asthma.--NEW SECTION--Patients with newly diagnosed to have bronchial asthma (n = 100) who fulfilled the study criteria were evaluated for depression with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score. Severity and level of bronchial asthma control were determined as per Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. Subjective asthma severity was assessed by Perceived Control of Asthma Questionnaire. Follow-up evaluation was done after three months of asthma management with the same study tools.--NEW SECTION--In our study population, 65% asthma patients showed depression on first visit (95% Confidence interval [CI] 55.65-74.35). Correlation coefficient between subjective asthma severity and severity of depression was -0.945 (p < 0.001) while correlation coefficient between objective asthma severity and depression severity was 0.066 (p = 0.515). In follow-up visit after asthma management 63% patients still had depression (95% CI 53.54-72.46). Correlation coefficient between objective asthma control and depression severity was 0.1 (p = 0.320). Correlation coefficient between subjective asthma severity and severity of depression was -0.979 (p < 0.001).--NEW SECTION--Our observational study suggests that depression is highly prevalent in asthma patients. There is a high inverse correlation between depression and patient's perception of asthma control. However, no significant correlation could be observed between objective measures of asthma severity and depression.",eng,The Indian journal of chest diseases & allied sciences,Clinical Study,2025-04-23,2015

Although several antidiabetic drugs are available, the need for novel therapeutic agents with improved efficacy and few side effects remains. Drugs derived from natural compounds are more attractive than synthetic drugs because of their diversity and minimal side effects. This review summarizes the most relevant effects of various plant-derived natural compounds on the functionality of pancreatic beta cells. Published data suggest that natural compounds directly enhance insulin secretion, prevent pancreatic beta cell apoptosis, and modulate pancreatic beta cell differentiation and proliferation. It is essential to continuously investigate natural compounds as sources of novel pharmaceuticals. Therefore, more studies into these compounds' mechanisms of action are warranted for their development as potential anti-diabetics.",eng,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Influenza vaccine has rarely been associated with vasculitis, acute kidney injury (AKI) and nephrotic syndrome (NS). Glomerular diseases following influenza vaccination have also been rarely reported. We report a patient who developed acute-onset massive proteinuria with NS and severe AKI soon after receiving the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. Kidney biopsy showed membranous nephropathy (MN) and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Optimal management of glomerular diseases or AIN following influenza vaccination is not known. Our patient responded well to an initial course of oral corticosteroid therapy with normalization of serum creatinine level but had a relapse of NS with AKI soon after completion of corticosteroid therapy. A repeat kidney biopsy revealed MN and resolved AIN. A subsequent prolonged course of oral corticosteroids resulted in complete clinical remission of the NS as well as normalization of renal function. Long-term response to corticosteroid therapy in such cases is not known. However, our patient continued to remain in clinical remission with normal renal function, five years after the initial treatment.",eng,"Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",Case Reports,2025-04-23,2015

To review trends or patterns in the positions taken by members of the WTO with respect to tobacco control measures. To discuss possible explanations for these observed trends/patterns.--NEW SECTION--We gathered data on tobacco-related disputes in the WTO since its establishment in 1995 and its forerunner, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), prior-FCTC and post-FCTC. We also looked at debates on tobacco control measures within the WTO more broadly. To this end, we classified and coded the positions of WTO member states during discussions on tobacco control and the FCTC, from 1995 until 2013, within the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Council.--NEW SECTION--There is a growing interest within the WTO for tobacco-related issues and opposition to tobacco control measures is moving away from high-income countries towards low(er) income countries.--NEW SECTION--The growing prominence of tobacco issues in the WTO can be attributed at least in part to the fact that during the past decade tobacco firms have been marginalised from the domestic policy-making process in many countries, which has forced them to look for other ways and forums to influence decision-making. Furthermore, the finding that almost all recent opposition within the WTO to stronger tobacco regulations came from developing countries is consistent with a relative shift of transnational tobacco companies' lobbying efforts from developed to developing countries.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We undertook a literature search of seven electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Medline, Global Health, Web of Knowledge, Academic Search Complete and Africa Wide Information) and manually searched bibliographies of included articles. The search was restricted to population-based studies on hearing impairment in Africa. Data were extracted using a standard protocol.--NEW SECTION--We identified 232 articles and included 28 articles in the final analysis. The most common cut-offs used for hearing impairment were 25 and 30 dB HL, but this ranged between 15 and 40 dB HL. For a cut-off of 25 dB, the median was 7.7% for the children- or school-based studies and 17% for population-based studies. For a cut-off of 30 dB HL, the median was 6.6% for the children or school-based studies and 31% for population-based studies. In schools for the deaf, the most common cause of hearing impairment was cryptogenic deafness (50%) followed by infectious causes (43%). In mainstream schools and general population, the most common cause of hearing impairment was middle ear disease (36%), followed by undetermined causes (35%) and cerumen impaction (24%).--NEW SECTION--There are very few population-based studies available to estimate the prevalence of hearing impairment in Africa. Those studies that are available use different cut-offs, making comparison difficult. However, the evidence suggests that the prevalence of hearing impairment is high and that much of it is avoidable or treatable.",eng,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This study aimed to assess how host country supervising clinical preceptors perceive learners on short-term global health electives of up to 6 weeks.--NEW SECTION--This study used a cross-sectional survey design and assessed international clinical preceptors' perceptions of short-term learners' (STLs) professional behaviors, medical knowledge, competency in systems-based care, as well as the benefits and burdens of hosting STLs. Surveys were sent to all clinical preceptors (n = 47) at 4 clinical sites in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015.--NEW SECTION--Thirty-two preceptors (68%) responded to the survey. Most respondents (97%) were satisfied in their role hosting STLs and reported that STLs enhanced patient care and the professional image of the clinical site. Nearly half of respondents (45%) reported decreased self-perceived efficiency in clinical care tasks. Qualitative data identified concerns related to STLs' professionalism and teamwork. Respondents also identified knowledge gaps in understanding differences in health systems and epidemiology in host country settings. Respondents preferred that rotations last at least 4 weeks and that STLs complete predeparture training.--NEW SECTION--STLs were largely positively regarded by international host clinical preceptors. To improve mutuality of benefits, sending institutions should ensure learners understand host country expectations of professionalism and that learners are well prepared for medical, ethical, and cultural challenges through participation in predeparture curricula that prepare them clinically and emotionally for these international experiences.

Hence, the need to equip health care providers with practical skills required to lead high-impact health care programs. In Uganda, the Afya Bora Global Health Leadership Fellowship is implemented through the Makerere University College of Health Sciences (MakCHS) and her partner institutions. Lessons learned from the program, presented in this paper, may guide development of in-service training opportunities to enhance leadership skills of health workers in resource-limited settings.--NEW SECTION--The Afya Bora Consortium, a consortium of four African and four U.S. academic institutions, offers 1-year global health leadership-training opportunities for nurses and doctors. Applications are received and vetted internationally by members of the consortium institutions in Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and the USA. Fellows have 3 months of didactic modules and 9 months of mentored field attachment with 80% time dedicated to fellowship activities. Fellows' projects and experiences, documented during weekly mentor-fellow meetings and monthly mentoring team meetings, were compiled and analyzed manually using pre-determined themes to assess the effect of the program on fellows' daily leadership opportunities.--NEW SECTION--Between January 2011 and January 2015, 15 Ugandan fellows (nine doctors and six nurses) participated in the program. Each fellow received 8 weeks of didactic modules held at one of the African partner institutions and three online modules to enhance fellows' foundation in leadership, communication, monitoring and evaluation, health informatics, research methodology, grant writing, implementation science, and responsible conduct of research. In addition, fellows embarked on innovative projects that covered a wide spectrum of global health challenges including critical analysis of policy formulation and review processes, bottlenecks in implementation of national HIV early infant diagnosis and prevention of mother-to-child HIV-transmission programs, and use of routine laboratory data about antibiotic resistance to guide updates of essential drug lists.--NEW SECTION--In-service leadership training was feasible, with ensured protected time for fellows to generate evidence-based solutions to challenges within their work environment.

And while there are treatments already on the market, there is a demand for new drugs that are effective and safe against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which reduce the number of drugs and the duration of treatment in both drug-susceptible TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).--NEW SECTION--This review covers promising novel investigational TB drugs that are currently under development. Specifically, the authors review the efficacy of novel agents for the treatment of TB in preclinical, phase I and phase II clinical trials. The authors also review the safety and tolerability profiles of these drugs.--NEW SECTION--Bedaquiline and delamanid are the most promising novel drugs for the treatment of MDR-TB, each having high efficacy and tolerability. However, the best regimen for achieving better outcomes and reducing adverse drug reactions remains to be determined, with safety concerns regarding cardiac events due to QT prolongation still to be addressed. Pretomanid is a novel drug that potentially shortens the duration of treatment in both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB in combination with moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide. Linezolid shows marked efficacy in the treatment of MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), but the drug is known to cause significant adverse drug reactions, including peripheral neuropathy, optic neuropathy and myelosuppression.

26576488,10.1016/j.ajog.2015.11.001,The relationship of circulating proteins in early pregnancy with preterm birth.,"Preterm birth (PTB) (< 37 completed weeks' gestation) is a pathological outcome of pregnancy and a major global health problem. Babies born preterm have an elevated risk for long-term adverse medical and neurodevelopmental sequelae. Substantial evidence implicates intrauterine infection and/or inflammation in PTB. However, these are often relatively late findings in the process, when PTB is inevitable. Identification of earlier markers of PTB may make successful intervention possible. Although select proteins, notably those related to the inflammatory pathways, have been associated with PTB, there has been a lack of research into the role of other protein pathways in the development of PTB. The purpose of this study was to investigate, using a previously described biomarker discovery approach, a subset of circulating proteins and their association with PTB focusing on samples from early pregnancy.--NEW SECTION--The objectives of the study were as follows: (1) to perform a large-scale biomarker discovery, utilizing an innovative platform to identify proteins associated with preterm birth in plasma taken between 10 and 15 weeks' gestation and, (2) to determine which protein pathways are most strongly associated with preterm birth. To address these aims, we measured 1129 proteins in a plasma sample from early pregnancy using a multiplexed aptamer-based proteomic technology developed in Colorado by SomaLogic.--NEW SECTION--Using a nested case-control approach, we measured proteins at a single time point in early pregnancy in 41 women who subsequently delivered preterm and 88 women who had term uncomplicated deliveries. We measured 1129 proteins using a multiplexed aptamer-based proteomic technology developed by SomaLogic. Logistic regressions and random forests were used to compare protein levels.--NEW SECTION--The complement factors B and H and the coagulation factors IX and IX ab were the highest-ranking proteins distinguishing cases of preterm birth from term controls. The top 3 pathways associated with preterm birth were the complement cascade, the immune system, and the clotting cascade.--NEW SECTION--Using a discovery approach, these data provide further confirmation that there is an association of immune- and coagulation-related events in early pregnancy with preterm birth. Thus, plasma protein profiles at 10-15 weeks of gestation are related to the development of preterm birth later in pregnancy.",eng,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that ""in the Asia/Pacific region, [cardiovascular disease] has become increasingly prevalent in recent decades, and now accounts for about one third of all deaths"". One risk factor that can lead to cardiovascular disease is hypertension. Based on WHO data from 2008, hypertension is now a global problem affecting 27% of the population 25 years of age or older.The risk for cardiovascular disease also appears to be higher among people in urban areas. A recent United Nations population report indicates that in the next 40 years we could see an increase in the world's population by 2.3 billion people. The majority of these people will be residing in urban areas, particularly in developing nations. Between 2011 and 2050, ""the population living in urban areas is projected to gain 2.6 billion, passing from 3.6 billion in 2011 to 6.3 billion in 2050"". Population growth in urban areas is therefore not only projected to include the expected population growth but also expected to include a shift of rural population to urban centers and ""most of the population growth expected in urban areas will be concentrated in the cities and towns of the less developed regions"". This growth of urban areas has the potential to put enormous pressures on health care systems that are already struggling to cope with the rapid increase in diseases thought to be more prevalent in Western societies, such as cardiovascular diseases.Hypertension may be difficult to treat due to a number of factors. Globally, access to antihypertensive medications, hypertension screening, and access to medical care vary from one country to another. Lifestyle factors, such as salt and alcohol consumption, stress, smoking, body weight, and exercise, are risk factors for hypertension that may be influenced by culture, which can in turn support or hinder lifestyle decisions that could significantly affect blood pressure. Hypertension, however, is easy to detect. A trained person with access to a low-cost sphygmomanometer can detect abnormal blood pressures quickly; however, access to trained personnel is not universally guaranteed. Globally - according to one model of skilled health care worker density and total requirement offered for discussion by the Global Health Workforce Alliance and WHO - there could currently be an estimated shortage of over seven million skilled health care workers (midwifes, nurses and physicians), as measured against a theoretical density of skilled health care workers to population. The shortage of skilled health care workers in this model could grow to over 12 million by 2035 if the assumptions of the model and population growth estimates are valid. Through rapid urbanization the potential for inequities in access to healthcare is also increased.Over the last few years, a number of community-based blood pressure screening and education initiatives have been established. These initiatives have been created either as part of research, as part of community outreach programs by publicly funded agencies, or as part of an outreach by not-for-profit organizations with a particular interest in reducing cardiovascular disease in specific hard-to-reach populations. Several systematic reviews have been conducted to assess different models for delivering services to people living with high blood pressure to assess community-based programs with a focus on cardiovascular disease, and to assess effectiveness of community health workers (CHW) in a variety of settings. These systematic reviews point to the importance of distinguishing between different categories of health care providers, their training and their roles in program delivery when assessing studies for possible inclusion in a systematic review.In a systematic review of studies from the US by Brownstein et al. focusing on the effectiveness of community health workers (CHWs) in the care of people with hypertension, this category of health care providers went under many different names. Community health workers in this review were defined as ""any health workers who carried out functions related to health care deliver, were trained as part of an intervention, had no formal paraprofessional or professional designation, and had a relationship with the community being served"". One of the findings from this review was the wide variety of formal training of the CHWs. In other parts of the world, a CHW might be defined differently. In their review of CHW-based programs focusing on children's health, Bhattacharyya, Winch, LeBan and Tien found that ""in general CHWs are not paid salaries because the MOH (Ministry of Health) or donors do not consider salaries to be sustainable. Yet CHWs are often held accountable and supervised as if they were employees. Community health worker programs must recognize that CHWs are volunteers (emphasis in original), even if they receive small monetary or nonmonetary incentives. They are volunteering their time to serve the community"". One Canadian model for delivering a cardiovascular awareness program designed to reach older adults through their primary care provider is based on volunteers with basic training to perform blood pressure measurements and cardiovascular health information.In a global review of a wide range of public health and health promotion initiatives operated by lay health workers from 2005, Lewin et al. identified over 40 different names or terms for a lay health worker. However, the definition of a lay health worker used by Lewin et al. is very similar to the definition of CHWs offered by Brownstein et al. Lewin et al.'s systematic review was the only study with a global focus that was located that reviewed studies of programs with a cardiovascular component using lay health workers. In this study, the sample size of studies focusing on lay health workers and cardiovascular disease was small (N=3) and the results from two of the studies were inconclusive to the point where the authors felt they could not pool the results.While a lay health worker may or may not receive some compensation for their work, volunteers in higher income areas of the world such as in North America typically do not receive any compensation. Volunteers, as observed by Bhattacharyya et al., are common in many parts of the world, and in some areas they provide delivery of programs and services that reach hundreds of thousands of individuals. One challenge for this systematic review will therefore be to isolate those programs that are delivered by lay health workers or volunteers who receive little or no compensation and programs where staff is paid. The importance of this distinction is on one hand related to cost - as observed by Bhattacharyya et al., many organizations responsible for delivery of community-based programs do not have funding for salaried staff. On the other hand there might be other factors in the relationship between a community being served by a program and the staff delivering the program. One such factor could be linked to the role of the person delivering the program as either a paid health care professional or an unpaid lay health worker or volunteer.Through this proposed JBI systematic review, the reviewers will focus on community-based blood pressure screening and health information programs delivered by either lay health workers or volunteers. Previous systematic reviews have indicated that programs focusing on blood pressure reduction delivered in a variety of settings and delivered by a variety of health care professionals might lower blood pressure among program participants over time. This systematic review will be limited to community-based programs rather than hospital or research facility-based programs, and to programs delivered by lay health workers or volunteers rather than programs delivered by paid community health workers, nurses or teams of health care providers under direction of a primary care provider. Compared to other recent systematic reviews which focused on studies with comparison groups and included few studies where lay health workers were involved, this systematic review will attempt to fill this gap in knowledge about programs delivered by lay health workers or volunteers by focusing on non-randomized controlled studies which report blood pressure changes over time in programs targeting the general population. Community-based programs might have a variety of designs with a number of different interventions, and where possible these designs and interventions will be identified and subgroup analysis conducted as appropriate. It is hoped that this systematic review can extend the work by Lewin et al. by identifying additional studies globally, focusing on programs delivered by lay health workers or volunteers but limited to studies reporting changes in blood pressure over time. Where possible, a meta-analysis of the changes in blood pressure over time among participants in these programs will be conducted.

However, BCG has limited applications, and a more effective vaccine is needed. Cellular mediated immunity (CMI) is thought to be the most important immune response for protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However, the recent failure of a clinical trial for a booster BCG vaccine and increasing evidence of antibody-mediated immunity prompted us to evaluate humoral immunity to Mtb-specific antigens. Using Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot and Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays, we observed less correlation of both CMI and IgG titers with patient clinical status, including serum concentration of C reactive protein. However, IgA titers against Mtb were significantly correlated with clinical status, suggesting that specific IgA antibodies protect against Mtb proliferation. In addition, in some cases, IgA antibody titers were significantly associated with the serum concentration of total albumin, which supports the idea that humoral immunity can be influenced by the nutritional status. Based on these observations, we propose that the induction of humoral immunity should be included as an option in TB vaccine development strategies.",eng,Journal of immunology research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

HIV-1 affects the central nervous system by releasing viral proteins that trigger neuronal death and neuroinflammation, and promotes alterations known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). This disorder is not fully understood, and no specific treatments are available. Recently, we demonstrated that the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120IIIB induces a functional upregulation of the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7) in neuronal cells. Furthermore, this upregulation promotes cell death that can be abrogated with receptor antagonists, suggesting that α7 may play an important role in the development of HAND. The partial duplication of the gene coding for the α7, known as CHRFAM7A, negatively regulates α7 expression but its role in HIV infection has not been studied. Hence, we studied both CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A regulation patterns in various gp120IIIB in vitro conditions. In addition, we measured CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A expression levels in postmortem brain samples from patients suffering from different stages of HAND. Our results demonstrate the induction of CHRNA7 expression accompanied by a significant downregulation of CHRFAM7A in neuronal cells when exposed to pathophysiological concentrations of gp120IIIB. Our results suggest a dysregulation of CHRFAM7A and CHRNA7 expressions in the basal ganglia from postmortem brain samples of HIV+ subjects and expand the current knowledge about the consequences of HIV infection in the brain.",eng,Journal of neurovirology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

IL-17, a CD4 T cell-derived mediator of angiogenesis, plays a major role in stimulating angiogenesis by regulating the production of a variety of proangiogenic factors, including the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The level of VEGF expression correlates with tumor progression and metastasis in gastric cancer tissues. Abnormal activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) rendered the tumor cells highly angiogenic, which is manifested by an increased microvascular density (MVD) and considered it as a potential molecular marker for poor prognosis in gastric cancer angiogenesis. We determined that IL-17A-induced VEGF upregulation and neovascularization through a Stat3-mediated signaling pathway and hypothesized that blocking the Stat3 activation by using JSI-124, an inhibitor of phosphorylated Stat3, could significantly reduce the VEGF expression and can thus prevent angiogenesis. We showed an inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor progression when JSI-124 was treated with IL-17A in the cells and xenografts in an animal model and suggested that targeting the Stat pathway with JSI-124 could derive an effective therapeutic target for gastric cancers and could be a promising drug in gastric cancer treatment.",eng,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Mother-to-child and early childhood horizontal transmission, the most common mechanisms of disease spread in West Africa, lead to a high rate of chronic infection. Although these transmission mechanisms are preventable through vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin, they are not routinely used due to limited resources. Antiviral therapy in pregnant women who are HBV positive is another option to reduce transmission. We conducted a survey study of pregnant women and clinicians at a teaching hospital in West Africa to determine the knowledge base about HBV and willingness to implement measures to reduce HBV transmission.

Evidence-based guidelines are needed to help providers determine when treatment should be initiated, which medication is most appropriate, and when treatment can safely be stopped. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases HBV guideline methodology and writing committees developed a protocol a priori for this systematic review. We searched multiple databases for randomized controlled trials and controlled observational studies that enrolled adults ≥18 years old diagnosed with chronic HBV infection who received antiviral therapy. Data extraction was done by pairs of independent reviewers. We included 73 studies, of which 59 (15 randomized controlled trials and 44 observational studies) reported clinical outcomes. Moderate-quality evidence supported the effectiveness of antiviral therapy in patients with immune active chronic HBV infection in reducing the risk of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In immune tolerant patients, moderate-quality evidence supports improved intermediate outcomes with antiviral therapy. Only very low-quality evidence informed the questions about discontinuing versus continuing antiviral therapy in hepatitis B e antigen-positive patients who seroconverted from hepatitis B e antigen to hepatitis B e antibody and about the safety of entecavir versus tenofovir. Noncomparative and indirect evidence was available for questions about stopping versus continuing antiviral therapy in hepatitis B e antigen-negative patients, monotherapy versus adding a second agent in patients with persistent viremia during treatment, and the effectiveness of antivirals in compensated cirrhosis with low-level viremia.--NEW SECTION--Most of the current literature focuses on the immune active phases of chronic HBV infection; decision-making in other commonly encountered and challenging clinical settings depends on indirect evidence.",eng,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The disease is a serious public health problem in Africa and the Middle East, and is a potential global health threat. In Kenya, outbreaks of the disease have disproportionately affected impoverished pastoralist communities. This study sought to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding RVF among the pastoralists of North Eastern Kenya, and to establish the determinants of KAP on RVF. A cross-sectional study involving 392 pastoralists living in Ijara district (Masalani and Ijara wards) was carried out using an interview questionnaire. All respondents interviewed (100%) had heard about RVF disease. They recognized that the disease is dangerous (99%), and had a positive attitude towards vaccination of animals (77%). However, few respondents knew that abortion (11%) and high mortality of young animals (10%) were key signs of RVF in animals. Very few (4%) use any form of protection when handling sick animals to avoid infection. Significant factors associated with knowledge were being in a household with a history of RVF infection (OR = 1.262, 95% CI = 1.099-1.447), having more livestock (OR = 1.285, 95% CI = 1.175-1.404) and the place of residence, Masalani (OR = 0.526, 95% CI = 0.480-0.576). Overall knowledge score on RVF was found to be a significant predictor of good preventive practice of the disease (OR = 1.073, 95% CI = 1.047-1.101).

However, no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for dengue is available. DENV interacts with host cell factors to complete its life cycle although this virus-host interplay remains to be fully elucidated. Many studies have identified the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) to be important for successful DENV production, but how the UPP contributes to DENV life cycle as host factors remains ill defined. We show here that proteasome inhibition decouples infectious virus production from viral RNA replication in antibody-dependent infection of THP-1 cells. Molecular and imaging analyses in β-lactone treated THP-1 cells suggest that proteasome function does not prevent virus assembly but rather DENV egress. Intriguingly, the licensed proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, is able to inhibit DENV titers at low nanomolar drug concentrations for different strains of all four serotypes of DENV in primary monocytes. Furthermore, bortezomib treatment of DENV-infected mice inhibited the spread of DENV in the spleen as well as the overall pathological changes. Our findings suggest that preventing DENV egress through proteasome inhibition could be a suitable therapeutic strategy against dengue.",eng,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, they also identified negative impacts of international aid, including episodes of poor quality care, internal brain drain, competition across facilities, decrease in patient flow to local facilities, and emigration of Haitian doctors to abroad. As Haiti continues to recover, it is imperative for aid institutions and local healthcare facilities to develop a more collaborative relationship to transition acute relief to sustainable capacity building.

Discourses largely focus on power and control of the non-poor over the poor despite all the rhetoric to the contrary. Economic aspects still dictate the debate rather than local people's understanding of well-being. Only with a major shift in the approach to local populations, acknowledging the communities' right to self-determination and accepting them as equal partners with access to genuine benefits, will this disturbing imbalance be redressed and allow better health for more people possible.

Four treatment options were modelled: sofosbuvir with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (SOF/PEG-IFN+RBV), sofosbuvir with ribavirin (SOF/RBV), simeprevir with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (SMV/PEG-IFN+RBV) and simeprevir with sofosbuvir (SMV/SOF).--NEW SECTION--SOF/PEG-IFN+RBV yielded a CER ratio of $6,796.22/QALY, SMV/PEG-IFN+RBV of $7,642.60/QALY and SMV/SOF of $8,959.11/QALY. SOF/RBV had a higher CER of $16,295.30/QALY. It is important to note however that SMV/SOF had the highest QALY at 19.08.--NEW SECTION--After consideration of quality of life, treatment regimens and treatment side effects, the SMV/SOF regimen yields acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios with high QALY.",eng,Antiviral therapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Meanwhile, conditions amenable to surgery are estimated to account for nearly 30% of the global burden of disease. We describe funds given to these efforts from the USA, the world's largest donor nation.--NEW SECTION--Retrospective database review. US Agency for International Development (USAID), National Institute of Health (NIH), Foundation Center and registered US charitable organisations were searched for financial data on any organisation giving exclusively to surgical care in low and middle income countries (LMICs). For USAID, NIH and Foundation Center all available data for all years were included. The five recent years of financial data per charitable organisation were included. All nominal dollars were adjusted for inflation by converting to 2014 US dollars.--NEW SECTION--USA.--NEW SECTION--USAID, NIH, Foundation Center, Charitable Organisations.--NEW SECTION--Cumulative funds appropriated to global surgery.--NEW SECTION--22 NIH funded projects (totalling $31.3 million) were identified, primarily related to injury and trauma. Six relevant USAID projects were identified-all obstetric fistula care totalling $438 million. A total of $105 million was given to universities and charitable organisations by US foundations for 12 different surgical specialties. 95 US charitable organisations representing 14 specialties totalled revenue of $2.67 billion and expenditure of $2.5 billion.--NEW SECTION--Current funding flows to surgical care in LMICs are poorly understood. US funding predominantly comes from private charitable organisations, is often narrowly focused and does not always reflect local needs or support capacity building. Improving surgical care, and embedding it within national health systems in LMICs, will likely require greater financial investment. Tracking funds targeting surgery helps to quantify and clarify current investments and funding gaps, ensures resources materialise from promises and promotes transparency within global health financing.",eng,BMJ open,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The strength of evidence was adjudicated using both the Oxford and GRADE methodology by two independent reviewers.--NEW SECTION--We identified 19 original articles. A total of 28 patients were described in these articles with 11 being adult, 9 being pediatric, and 8 of unknown age. Seizure reduction/control with IV MgSO4 occurred in 14 of the 28 patients (50.0%), with 2 (7.1%) and 12 (42.9%) displaying partial and complete responses respectively. Seizures recurred upon withdrawal of MgSO4 therapy in 50% of the patients whom had reduction/control of their SE/RSE. Three patients had recorded adverse events related to MgSO4 therapy.--NEW SECTION--Oxford level 4, GRADE D evidence exists to suggest a trend towards improved seizure control with the use of intravenous MgSO4 for non-eclamptic RSE. Routine use of IV MgSO4 in non-eclamptic SE/RSE cannot be recommended at this time.

26545007,NA,[Global health 2035: a world converging within a generation].,"Prompted by the 20th anniversary of the 1993 World Development Report, a Lancet Commission revisited the case for investment in health and developed a new investment framework to achieve dramatic health gains by 2035. The Commission's report has four key messages, each accompanied by opportunities for action by national governments of low-income and middle-income countries and by the international community. First, there is an enormous economic payoff from investing in health. The impressive returns make a strong case for both increased domestic financing of health and for allocating a higher proportion of official development assistance to development of health. Second, modeling by the Commission found that a ""grand convergence"" in health is achievable by 2035-that is, a reduction in infectious, maternal, and child mortality down to universally low levels. Convergence would require aggressive scale up of existing and new health tools, and it could mostly be financed from the expected economic growth of low- and middle-income countries. The international community can best support convergence by funding the development and delivery of new health technologies and by curbing antibiotic resistance. Third, fiscal policies -such as taxation of tobacco and alcohol- are a powerful and underused lever that governments can use to curb non-communicable diseases and injuries while also raising revenue for health. International action on NCDs and injuries should focus on providing technical assistance on fiscal policies, regional cooperation on tobacco, and funding policy and implementation research on scaling-up of interventions to tackle these conditions. Fourth, progressive universalism, a pathway to universal health coverage (UHC) that includes the poor from the outset, is an efficient way to achieve health and financial risk protection. For national governments, progressive universalism would yield high health gains per dollar spent and poor people would gain the most in terms of health and financial protection. The international community can best support countries to implement progressive UHC by financing policy and implementation research, such as on the mechanics of designing and implementing evolution of the benefits package as the resource envelope for public finance grows.",spa,Salud publica de Mexico,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26544672,10.1002/14651858.CD009385.pub2,Exercise training to improve exercise capacity and quality of life in people with non-malignant dust-related respiratory diseases.,"Non-malignant dust-related respiratory diseases, such as asbestosis and silicosis, are similar to other chronic respiratory diseases and may be characterised by breathlessness, reduced exercise capacity and reduced health-related quality of life. Some non-malignant dust-related respiratory diseases are a global health issue and very few treatment options, including pharmacological, are available. Therefore, examining the role of exercise training is particularly important to determine whether exercise training is an effective treatment option in non-malignant dust-related respiratory diseases.--NEW SECTION--To assess the effects of exercise training for people with non-malignant dust-related respiratory diseases compared with control, placebo or another non-exercise intervention on exercise capacity, health-related quality of life and levels of physical activity.--NEW SECTION--We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro and AMED (all searched from inception until February 2015), national and international clinical trial registries, reference lists of relevant papers and we contacted experts in the field for identification of suitable studies.--NEW SECTION--We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared exercise training of at least four weeks duration with no exercise training, placebo or another non-exercise intervention.--NEW SECTION--We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We employed the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome and to interpret findings. We synthesized study results using a random-effects model based on the assessment of heterogeneity. We conducted subgroup analyses on participants with dust-related interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) and participants with asbestos related pleural disease (ARPD).--NEW SECTION--Two RCTs including a combined total of 40 participants (35 from one study and five from a second study) met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one participants were randomised to the exercise training group and 19 participants were randomised to the control group. The included studies evaluated the effects of exercise training compared to a control group of no exercise training in people with dust-related ILDs and ARPD. The exercise training programme in both studies was in an outpatient setting for an eight-week period. The risk of bias was low in both studies. There were no reported adverse events of exercise training. Following exercise training, six-minute walk distance (6MWD) increased with a mean difference (MD) of 53.81 metres (m) (95% CI 34.36 to 73.26 m). Improvements were also seen in the domains of health-related quality of life: Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnoea domain (MD 2.58, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.44); CRQ Fatigue domain (MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.89); CRQ Emotional Function domain (MD 2.61, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.49); and CRQ Mastery domain (MD 1.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.72). Improvements in exercise capacity and health-related quality of life were also evident six months following the intervention period: 6MWD (MD 52.68 m, 95% CI 27.43 to 77.93 m); CRQ Dyspnoea domain (MD 3.03, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.66); CRQ Emotional Function domain (MD 5.57, 95% CI 2.34 to 8.81); and CRQ Mastery domain (MD 2.66, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.23). Exercise training did not result in improvements in the Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnoea scale immediately following exercise training or six months following exercise training. The improvements following exercise training were similar in a subgroup of participants with dust-related ILDs and in a subgroup of participants with ARPD compared to the control group, with no statistically significant differences in treatment effects between the subgroups.--NEW SECTION--The evidence examining exercise training in people with non-malignant dust-related respiratory diseases is of very low quality. This is due to imprecision in the results from the small number of trials and the small number of participants, the indirectness of evidence due to a paucity of information on disease severity and the data from one study being from a subgroup of participants, and inconsistency from high heterogeneity in some results. Therefore, although the review findings indicate that an exercise training programme is effective in improving exercise capacity and health-related quality of life in the short-term and at six months follow-up, we remain unsure of these findings due to the very low quality evidence. Larger, high quality trials are needed to determine the strength of these findings.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

For the control of tuberculosis as well as other infectious diseases, WHO recommended ""ASSURED"" (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to the end user) diagnostic tools that can easily be maintained and used in developing countries. Aptamers are promising tools for developing point-of-care diagnostic assays for TB. In this study, ssDNA aptamers that recognize Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra were selected by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). For this purpose, two different selection protocols, ultrafiltration and centrifugation, were applied. A total of 21 TB specific aptamers were selected. These aptamers exhibited ""G-rich"" regions on the 3' terminus of the aptamers, including a motif of ""TGGGG,"" ""GTGG,"" or ""CTGG."" Binding capability of selected aptamers were investigated by quantitative PCR and Mtb36 DNA aptamer was found the most specific aptamer to M. tuberculosis H37Ra. The dissociation constant (K d) of Mtb36 aptamer was calculated as 5.09 ± 1.43 nM in 95% confidence interval. Relative binding ratio of Mtb36 aptamer to M. tuberculosis H37Ra over Mycobacterium bovis and Escherichia coli was also determined about 4 times and 70 times more, respectively. Mtb36 aptamer is highly selective for M. tuberculosis, and it can be used in an aptamer-based biosensor for the detection of M. tuberculosis.",eng,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Although antidepressants are used for its treatment, efficacy is often inconsistent. Thus, the search for alternative therapeutic medicines for its treatment is still important. In this study, the antidepressant-like effect of Pseudospondias microcarpa extract (30-300 mg kg(-1), p.o.) was investigated in two predictive models of depression--forced swimming test and tail suspension test in mice. Additionally, the mechanism(s) of action involved were assessed. Acute treatment with the extract dose dependently reduced immobility of mice in both models. The antidepressant-like effect of the extract (100 mg kg(-1), p.o.) was blocked by p-chlorophenylalanine and cyproheptadine but not prazosin, propranolol, or yohimbine. Concomitant administration of D-cycloserine and the extract potentiated the anti-immobility effect. In contrast, D-serine, a full agonist of glycine/NMDA receptors, abolished the effects. Anti-immobility effects of PME were prevented by pretreatment of mice with L-arginine (750 mg kg(-1), i.p.) and sildenafil (5 mg kg(-1), i.p.). On the contrary, pretreatment of mice with L-NAME (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.) or methylene blue (10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) potentiated its effects.

Excessive accumulation of fat by disrupting the balance system causes overweight and obesity, which are increasingly becoming global health concerns. Understanding the pathogenesis of obesity focused on studying the genes related to familial types of obesity. Recently, a rare human genetic disorder, ciliopathy, links the role for genes regulating structure and function of a cellular organelle, the primary cilium, to metabolic disorder, obesity and type II diabetes. Primary cilia are microtubule based hair-like membranous structures, lacking motility and functions such as sensing the environmental cues, and transducing extracellular signals within the cells. Interestingly, the subclass of ciliopathies, such as Bardet-Biedle and Alström syndrome, manifest obesity and type II diabetes in human and mouse model systems. Moreover, studies on genetic mouse model system indicate that more ciliary genes affect energy homeostasis through multiple regulatory steps such as central and peripheral actions of leptin and insulin. In this review, we discuss the latest findings in primary cilia and metabolic disorders, and propose the possible interaction between primary cilia and the leptin and insulin signal pathways which might enhance our understanding of the unambiguous link of a cell's antenna to obesity and type II diabetes.",eng,BMB reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26537672,10.1128/JVI.01835-15,Small Interfering RNA Pathway Modulates Initial Viral Infection in Midgut Epithelium of Insect after Ingestion of Virus.,"Numerous viruses are transmitted in a persistent manner by insect vectors. Persistent viruses establish their initial infection in the midgut epithelium, from where they disseminate to the midgut visceral muscles. Although propagation of viruses in insect vectors can be controlled by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) antiviral pathway, whether the siRNA pathway can control viral dissemination from the midgut epithelium is unknown. Infection by a rice virus (Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus [SRBSDV]) of its incompetent vector (the small brown planthopper [SBPH]) is restricted to the midgut epithelium. Here, we show that the siRNA pathway is triggered by SRBSDV infection in continuously cultured cells derived from the SBPH and in the midgut of the intact insect. Knockdown of the expression of the core component Dicer-2 of the siRNA pathway by RNA interference strongly increased the ability of SRBSDV to propagate in continuously cultured SBPH cells and in the midgut epithelium, allowing viral titers in the midgut epithelium to reach the threshold (1.99 × 10(9) copies of the SRBSDV P10 gene/μg of midgut RNA) needed for viral dissemination into the SBPH midgut muscles. Our results thus represent the first elucidation of the threshold for viral dissemination from the insect midgut epithelium. Silencing of Dicer-2 further facilitated the transmission of SRBSDV into rice plants by SBPHs. Taken together, our results reveal the new finding that the siRNA pathway can control the initial infection of the insect midgut epithelium by a virus, which finally affects the competence of the virus's vector.--NEW SECTION--Many viral pathogens that cause significant global health and agricultural problems are transmitted via insect vectors. The first bottleneck in viral infection, the midgut epithelium, is a principal determinant of the ability of an insect species to transmit a virus. Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) is restricted exclusively to the midgut epithelium of an incompetent vector, the small brown planthopper (SBPH). Here, we show that silencing of the core component Dicer-2 of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway increases viral titers in the midgut epithelium past the threshold (1.99 × 10(9) copies of the SRBSDV P10 gene/μg of midgut RNA) for viral dissemination into the midgut muscles and then into the salivary glands, allowing the SBPH to become a competent vector of SRBSDV. This result is the first evidence that the siRNA antiviral pathway has a direct role in the control of viral dissemination from the midgut epithelium and that it affects the competence of the virus's vector.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Empowerment is frequently advocated as a positive approach to addressing individual and community-level health needs. Despite its popularity, relatively little has been said about the unintended consequences of empowerment, which may give rise to some troubling ethical issues or, indeed, result in outcomes that may not be considered health promoting.--NEW SECTION--Drawing on current uses of empowerment within health promotion, along with insights from an ethnographic study on young people's health, this paper raises some critical questions about the ethics of empowerment. By doing so, the paper troubles the idea that empowerment is a 'good thing' without some careful attention to the varying ways in which the ethics of empowerment may unfold in practice.--NEW SECTION--Findings revealed young people's different perspectives on health and priorities for health promotion. The present analysis highlights how these alternative framings prompt a number of ethical tensions for understanding and operationalising empowerment.--NEW SECTION--In conclusion, the findings underscore the importance of promoting ethical reflexivity in health promotion and, crucially, attending to the unintended and potentially ethically problematic consequences of empowerment.

It has been suggested that an impaired capacity to increase muscle protein synthesis rates in response to protein intake is a key contributor to sarcopenia. We assessed whether differences in post-absorptive and/or post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates exist between large cohorts of healthy young and older men.--NEW SECTION--We performed a cross-sectional, retrospective study comparing in vivo post-absorptive muscle protein synthesis rates determined with stable isotope methodologies between 34 healthy young (22±1 y) and 72 older (75±1 y) men, and post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates between 35 healthy young (22±1 y) and 40 older (74±1 y) men.--NEW SECTION--Post-absorptive muscle protein synthesis rates did not differ significantly between the young and older group. Post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates were 16% lower in the older subjects when compared with the young. Muscle protein synthesis rates were >3 fold more responsive to dietary protein ingestion in the young. Irrespective of age, there was a strong negative correlation between post-absorptive muscle protein synthesis rates and the increase in muscle protein synthesis rate following protein ingestion.--NEW SECTION--Aging is associated with the development of muscle anabolic inflexibility which represents a key physiological mechanism underpinning sarcopenia.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Dengue, malaria, and enteric fever are common causes of fever in returning travelers and timely and appropriate treatment is important. However, differentiation is difficult without specific diagnostic tests.--NEW SECTION--A retrospective study was conducted at the National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) from April 2005 to March 2013. Febrile travelers returning from overseas who were diagnosed with dengue, malaria, or enteric fever were included in this study. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were compared for each diagnosis.--NEW SECTION--During the study period, 86 malaria, 85 dengue, and 31 enteric fever cases were identified. The mean age of the study cohort was 33.1 ± 12 years and 134 (66.3%) study participants were male. Asia was the most common area visited by returning travelers with fevers (89% of dengue, 18.6% of malaria, and 100% of enteric fever cases), followed by Africa (1.2% of dengue and 70.9% of malaria cases). Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were significantly different among each group with each diagnosis. Decision tree models revealed that returning from Africa and CRP levels < 10 mg/L were factors specific for diagnosis of malaria and dengue fever, respectively.--NEW SECTION--Clinical manifestations, simple laboratory test results, and regions of travel are helpful to distinguish between dengue, malaria, and enteric fever in febrile returning travelers with non-specific symptoms.",eng,Kansenshogaku zasshi.

These programs have an explicit emphasis on developing projects that address the priorities of the partner country as well as the donor. While the objectives of cooperative bioengagement programs focus on reducing the potential for accidental or intentional misuse and/or release of dangerous biological agents, many partner countries are interested in bioengagement as a means to improve basic public health capacities.

Notwithstanding nuclear triage and management plans and technical monitoring standards within the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization (WHO), the capacity to rapidly deploy a robust professional workforce with the internal coordination and collaboration capabilities required for large-scale nuclear crises is profoundly lacking. A similar dilemma, evident in the early stages of the Ebola epidemic, was eventually managed by using worldwide infectious disease experts from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and multiple multidisciplinary WHO-supported foreign medical teams. This success has led the WHO to propose the development of a Global Health Workforce. A strategic format is proposed for nuclear preparedness and response that builds and expands on the current model for infectious disease outbreak currently under consideration. This study proposes the inclusion of a nuclear global health workforce under the technical expertise of the International Atomic Energy Agency and WHO's Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network leadership and supported by the International Health Regulations Treaty. Rationales are set forth for the development, structure, and function of a nuclear workforce based on health outcomes research that define the unique health, health systems, and public health challenges of a nuclear crisis. Recent research supports that life-saving opportunities are possible, but only if a rapidly deployed and robust multidisciplinary response component exists.",eng,Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,Historical Article,2025-04-23,2016

We designed a prospective pilot study investigating whether elderly patients (>60 years) would also be able to participate in such a programme. It consisted of physiotherapist-supervised alternating endurance and resistance workouts on 6 of 7 days a week. Sixteen consecutive patients undergoing allo-HSCT were enrolled into the study. The median age was 64.5 years. Twelve patients participated in the programme until the time of discharge (75%) from the transplant unit. Therefore, the predefined criteria regarding feasibility were met. The reason for drop out was transplantation associated mortality in all patients (n = 4). Adherence was very good with a median of 85% attended training sessions. No adverse events were recorded. The endurance capacity dropped by 7% and lower extremity strength improved by 2% over time. Quality of life decreased during the study period, with global health being significantly worse at the time of discharge. In conclusion, a combined and intensified strength and endurance exercise programme is feasible and safe in a population of elderly patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Further research should focus on exploring effect sizes of such an intervention by conducting randomised controlled trials.",eng,European journal of cancer care,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2016

There are valuable synergies between efforts to reduce food loss and waste and those promoting public health. To demonstrate the potential impact of building upon these synergies, we present an analysis of policies and interventions addressing food loss and waste, food security, food safety, and nutrition. We characterize as opportunities the policies and interventions that promote synergistic relationships between goals in the fields of food loss and waste and of public health. We characterize as challenges the policies and interventions that may reduce food loss and waste but compromise public health, or improve public health but increase food loss and waste. Some interventions are both opportunities and challenges. With deliberate planning and action, challenges can often be addressed and turned into opportunities. In other cases, it may be necessary to strike a balance between potential benefit in one area and risk of harm in the other. To help policy makers make the best use of the opportunities while tackling the challenges, it is essential to consider public health in efforts to reduce food loss and waste.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

To address this issue, we synthesized vancomycin aglycon dimers to systematically probe the impact of a linker on biological activity. A dimer having a pendant lipophilic moiety in the linker showed ∼300-fold more activity than vancomycin against VRE. The high activity of the compound is attributed to its enhanced binding affinity to target peptides which resulted in improved peptidoglycan (cell wall) biosynthesis inhibition.

It is estimated there are more than 2 billion individuals exposed to the virus and 250 million are chronically infected. Hepatitis B is the cause of more than 600000 annual deaths due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. An effective vaccine exists and preventative initiatives center around universal vaccination especially in those at highest risk. Effective vaccination algorithms have led to a significant decline in the development of new infections and its devastating consequences. The vaccine is administered intramuscularly in three doses, with 95% showing long lasting serologic immunity. An additional fourth dose or a repeated higher dose three course regimen is given to those that fail to show immunity. Despite these additional regimens, some remain vulnerable to hepatitis B and are deemed non-responders. Individuals with chronic disease states such as kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, as well as those with a genetic predisposition, and those on immunomodulation therapy, have the highest likelihood of non-response. Various strategies have been developed to elicit an immune response in these individuals. These include increased vaccination dose, intradermal administration, alternative adjuvants, alternative routes of administration, co-administration with other vaccines, and other novel therapies. These alternative strategies can show improved response and lasting immunity. In summary, HBV vaccination is a major advance of modern medicine and all individuals at risk should be sought and vaccinated with subsequent adequate titers demonstrated.",eng,World journal of hepatology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We suggest that such an impact turned out to be catastrophic because it hit particularly hard human resources for health and the delivery of primary healthcare services, which are cross-sectional to any health system. National and international interventions failed to understand the nature of this interaction, and concentrated on attending urgent specific vertical functions to fight the outbreak--the pillars--such as surveillance, logistics, safe burials etc. Such patchwork and vertical intervention strategy was always going to fail to tackle a system-wide problem, particularly in already fragile systems.

Adipose tissue with proinflammatory properties could be involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) activity and radiographic progression. This study aims to investigate the influence of overweight and obesity on RA activity and severity.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis to assess the association of body mass index (BMI) categories with the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), functional disability [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], and radiographic joint damage in patients with RA. We searched Medline through PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for all studies assessing DAS28, HAQ, or/and radiographic damage according to predefined BMI groups.--NEW SECTION--Among the 737 citations retrieved, 58 articles met the inclusion criteria and 7 were included in the metaanalysis. DAS28 was higher in obese (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)) than non-obese (BMI ≤ 30 kg/m(2)) patients (mean difference 0.14, 95% CI 0.01-0.27, p = 0.04, I(2) = 0%). HAQ score was also higher among obese patients (mean difference 0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.19, p = 0.03, I(2) = 0%). Radiographic joint damage was negatively associated with obesity (standardized mean difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.02, p = 0.03, I(2) = 38%).--NEW SECTION--Obesity in RA is associated with increased DAS28 and HAQ score and with lower radiographic joint damage. These associations mainly result from an increase of subjective components of the DAS28 (total joint count and global health assessment) in obese patients. Conflicting results were reported concerning inflammation markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate).",eng,The Journal of rheumatology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
32287367,10.1111/1468-2346.12454,WHO's next? Changing authority in global health governance after Ebola.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) occupies a central place in the system of global health governance and plays a key role in the control of epidemics and pandemics. The 2014 Ebola crisis in West Africa, however, saw widespread and sustained criticism of its performance, leading many to call for its reform and even replacement. This article moves on from initial analyses of the WHO's 'failure', to argue that the crisis has led to a shift in its authority as a global governor. It argues that the WHO's traditional basis of authority was largely expert and delegated; that it provided technical advice and normative guidance, and that its authority was 'on loan' from member states, who exerted considerable influence over the WHO. Its actions during the West African Ebola outbreak remained consistent with this, but it was unable to cope with what the outbreak required. The criticisms both of the WHO and the wider system of global health governance, however, have opened up a space where the balance of authority is shifting to one based more heavily on capacity-the ability to act in a crisis. If such a shift is realized, it will create different expectations of the WHO which, if they are not fulfilled, may lead to trust in the organisation declining and its legitimacy being compromised.",eng,International affairs,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We assessed the behaviour change techniques used in each intervention and included a new category of male partner involvement. We identified six studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The most effective interventions were those that involve male partner involvement in the decision to initiate contraceptive use. The findings also suggest that providing access to contraceptives in the community promotes their use. The interventions that had positive effects on contraceptive use used a combination of behaviour change techniques. Performance techniques were not used in any of the interventions. The use of social support techniques, which are meant to improve wider social acceptability, did not appear except in two of the interventions.

This review discusses the link between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular diseases onset, focusing on the role of recently emerging downstream mediators, namely, oxidative stress and glucose metabolic pathway perturbations. The role of hyperglycemia-mediated activation of nonoxidative glucose pathways (NOGPs) [i.e., the polyol pathway, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and protein kinase C] in this process is extensively reviewed. The proposal is made that there is a unique interplay between NOGPs and a downstream convergence of detrimental effects that especially affect cardiac endothelial cells, thereby contributing to contractile dysfunction. In this process the AGE pathway emerges as a crucial mediator of hyperglycemia-mediated detrimental effects. In addition, a vicious metabolic cycle is established whereby hyperglycemia-induced NOGPs further fuel their own activation by generating even more oxidative stress, thereby exacerbating damaging effects on cardiac function. Thus NOGP inhibition, and particularly that of the AGE pathway, emerges as a novel therapeutic intervention for the treatment of cardiovascular complications such as acute myocardial infarction in the presence hyperglycemia.",eng,American journal of physiology.

The dosage of added sugar intake as a percentage of total energy was extracted or calculated. Means and standard deviations of pre- and post-test measurements or changes in ectopic fat depots were collected.--NEW SECTION--Fourteen RCTs were included. Most of the studies had a medium to high risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed that, compared with eucaloric controls, subjects who consumed added sugar under hypercaloric conditions likely increased ectopic fat, particularly in the liver (pooled standardized mean difference = 0.9 [95%CI, 0.6-1.2], n = 6) and muscles (pooled SMD = 0.6 [95%CI, 0.2-1.0], n = 4). No significant difference was observed in liver fat, visceral adipose tissue, or muscle fat when isocaloric intakes of different sources of added sugars were compared.--NEW SECTION--Data from a limited number of RCTs suggest that excess added sugar intake under hypercaloric diet conditions likely increases ectopic fat depots, particularly in the liver and in muscle fat. There are insufficient data to compare the effect of different sources of added sugars on ectopic fat deposition or to compare intake of added sugar with intakes of other macronutrients. Future well-designed RCTs with sufficient power and duration are needed to address the role of sugars on ectopic fat deposition.",eng,Nutrition reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Review of the literature.,"Mobile communication devices help accelerate in-hospital flow of medical information, information sharing and querying, and contribute to communications in the event of emergencies through their application and access to wireless media technology. Healthcare-associated infections remain a leading and high-cost problem of global health systems despite improvements in modern therapies. The objective of this article was to review different studies on the relationship between mobile phones (MPs) and bacterial cross-contamination and report common findings. Thirty-nine studies published between 2005 and 2013 were reviewed. Of these, 19 (48.7%) identified coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), and 26 (66.7%) identified Staphylococcus aureus; frequency of growth varied. The use of MPs by healthcare workers increases the risk of repetitive cyclic contamination between the hands and face (e.g., nose, ears, and lips), and differences in personal hygiene and behaviors can further contribute to the risks. MPs are rarely cleaned after handling. They may transmit microorganisms, including multiple resistant strains, after contact with patients, and can be a source of bacterial cross-contamination. To prevent bacterial contamination of MPs, hand-washing guidelines must be followed and technical standards for prevention strategies should be developed.",eng,Journal of infection in developing countries,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26516679,10.2217/fmb.15.76,Overcoming drug resistance for tuberculosis.,"Despite enormous progress, tuberculosis (TB) is still a major global health problem. Poor patients' adherence to the current treatment leads to the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains. While increased numbers of MDR-TB cases can be ascribed to difficulties in treating TB-HIV coinfected patients, many studies demonstrated that the emergence of drug-resistant TB is clearly linked to misdiagnosis and mismanagement of drug-susceptible TB. Therefore, rapid detection and proper treatment are needed globally to both cure TB patients and prevent wide spreading of the disease. This paper provides a survey of the major strategies that have been explored for overcoming drug resistance in TB.",eng,Future microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This clinical burden is evident in the UK prison population, where the prevalence of CNCP has never previously been determined. This study, conducted in June/July 2013, used prescribing data and a systematic review of clinical records from two UK prison establishments to derive a figure for point-prevalence of CNCP. Results showed that 20% of the total aggregated prisoner rolls (N = 1944) described CNCP and had been in receipt of treatment with daily analgesia, for a period of at least 3 months prior to observation date. This prevalence of CNCP was related to increasing age group (Spearman's rank correlation 0.94). Of those on continuous analgesic therapy (CAT), 44% were taking continuous opioid therapy (COT) of any sort. Prisoners with a diagnosis of opioid-type drug dependence (OTDD) were more than twice as likely to complain of CNCP and be on continuous medication for it (odds ratio 2.3). The issues relating to CNCP in prisons are discussed. Further research is recommended, identifying factors influencing CNCP prevalence in prisons, and enabling comparisons to CNCP prevalence in the UK general population.",eng,British journal of pain,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26516147,10.1093/heapol/czv071,Altogether now... understanding the role of international organizations in iCCM policy transfer.,"Policy transfer theories explain how policy ideas move across time and geography and offer an approach to understanding waves of policy change, a common phenomenon in global health. Four primary mechanisms for the transfer of policies from global to national levels are posited: learning, coercion, socialization and competition.--NEW SECTION--We used six concurrent country case studies of policy change for child survival followed by a global study to analyse (1) mechanisms for policy transfer and (2) the roles of international organizations in promoting policy transfer. Our six country cases drew upon early adopters of integrated Community Case Management of Childhood Illness policy (Malawi, Niger), as well as countries that were slower to adopt due either to practical implementation challenges (Mozambique, Mali) and/or policy resistance (Burkina Faso, Kenya). In total, 145 semi-structured interviews and 283 document reviews were conducted across the six country cases, and 25 semi-structured interviews and 72 document reviews for the global study.--NEW SECTION--Three of the four diffusion mechanisms (learning, coercion and socialization) were important in these cases, but not competition. Multiple strategies were employed by multilateral organizations to support policy transfer, such as regional meetings or academic publications, frequently serving multiple diffusion mechanisms simultaneously (e.g. both learning and socialization). In just one country case, funding conditionalities were used to press for policy change. The emphasis of policy transfer mechanisms varied between early and later adopters. Early adopters, for example, were more likely to engage in learning. International multilateral organizations were active policy transfer agents, and national policy-makers perception of them as ""trusted partners"" made them well suited for this role. However, on occasion their role became more that of advocates than neutral facilitators.--NEW SECTION--International actors use multiple synergistic channels to promote uptake of global health policies in low- and middle-income countries, and tailor strategies employed to country contexts.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26516146,10.1093/heapol/czv043,Epistemic communities in global health and the development of child survival policy: a case study of iCCM.,"Nearly all African countries have recently implemented some form of integrated community case management of childhood illness (iCCM), a strategy aimed at reducing child mortality by providing curative care for common yet fatal childhood illnesses. This case study describes the evolution of iCCM at the global level using the theory of epistemic communities first outlined by Haas, which explains how international policy coordination on technical issues takes place via transnational expert networks. We draw from in-depth interviews with global policy-makers (n = 25), a document review (n = 72) and co-authorship network analysis of scientific articles on iCCM. We find that members of the iCCM epistemic community were mainly mid- to upper-level technical officers working in the headquarters of large norm-setting bodies, implementing partners, funders and academic/research groups in global health. Already linked by pre-existing relationships, the epistemic community was consolidated as conflicts were overcome through structural changes in the network (including or excluding some members), changes in the state of technology or scientific evidence, shifting funding considerations, and the development of consensus through argument, legitimation and other means. Next, the epistemic community positioned iCCM as a preferred solution via three causal dynamics outlined by Haas: (1) responding to decision-makers' uncertainty about how to reduce child mortality after previous policies proved insufficient, (2) using sophisticated analytic tools to link the problem of child mortality to iCCM as a solution and (3) gaining buy-in from major norm-setting bodies and financial and institutional support from large implementing agencies. Applying the epistemic communities framework to the iCCM case study reveals the strengths and weaknesses of a focused policy enterprise with highly specialized and homogenous disciplinary origins, allowing for efficient sharing of complex, high-level scientific information, but possibly excluding voices with relevant methodological, operational or country-level perspectives.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26513658,10.1371/journal.pone.0141729,Insights into the Immunological Properties of Intrinsically Disordered Malaria Proteins Using Proteome Scale Predictions.,"Malaria remains a significant global health burden. The development of an effective malaria vaccine remains as a major challenge with the potential to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. While Plasmodium spp. have been shown to contain a large number of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or disordered protein regions, the relationship of protein structure to subcellular localisation and adaptive immune responses remains unclear. In this study, we employed several computational prediction algorithms to identify IDPs at the proteome level of six Plasmodium spp. and to investigate the potential impact of protein disorder on adaptive immunity against P. falciparum parasites. IDPs were shown to be particularly enriched within nuclear proteins, apical proteins, exported proteins and proteins localised to the parasitophorous vacuole. Furthermore, several leading vaccine candidates, and proteins with known roles in host-cell invasion, have extensive regions of disorder. Presentation of peptides by MHC molecules plays an important role in adaptive immune responses, and we show that IDP regions are predicted to contain relatively few MHC class I and II binding peptides owing to inherent differences in amino acid composition compared to structured domains. In contrast, linear B-cell epitopes were predicted to be enriched in IDPs. Tandem repeat regions and non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were found to be strongly associated with regions of disorder. In summary, immune responses against IDPs appear to have characteristics distinct from those against structured protein domains, with increased antibody recognition of linear epitopes but some constraints for MHC presentation and issues of polymorphisms. These findings have major implications for vaccine design, and understanding immunity to malaria.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Reductions in the mass and function of β-cells contribute to most of the pathophysiology underlying diabetes. Thus, physiological control of blood glucose levels can be adequately restored by replacing functioning β-cell mass. Sources of functional islets for transplantation are limited, resulting in great interest in the development of alternate sources, and recent progress regarding cell fate change via utilization of extracellular vesicles, also known as exosomes and microvesicles, is notable. Thus, this study investigated the therapeutic capacity of extracellular vesicle-mimetic nanovesicles (NVs) derived from a murine pancreatic β-cell line. To differentiate insulin-producing cells effectively, a three-dimensional in vivo microenvironment was constructed in which extracellular vesicle-mimetic NVs were applied to subcutaneous Matrigel platforms containing bone marrow (BM) cells in diabetic immunocompromised mice. Long-term control of glucose levels was achieved over 60 days, and differentiation of donor BM cells into insulin-producing cells in the subcutaneous Matrigel platforms, which were composed of islet-like cell clusters with extensive capillary networks, was confirmed along with the expression of key pancreatic β-cell markers. The resectioning of the subcutaneous Matrigel platforms caused a rebound in blood glucose levels and confirmed the source of functioning β-cells. Thus, efficient differentiation of therapeutic insulin-producing cells was attained in vivo through the use of extracellular vesicle-mimetic NVs, which maintained physiological glucose levels.",eng,ACS nano,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Predictor variables included health literacy, age, race, gender, education, employment status, difficulty paying bills, hospital diagnosis, length of stay, self-reported global health status, depression, perceived health competence, medication adherence, and health care system distrust. In a sample of 2,042 patients, multivariable models demonstrated that lower health literacy and younger age were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of completing research follow-up interviews at 2-3 days, 30 days, and 90 days after hospital discharge. In addition, patients who had less education, were currently employed, and had moderate financial stress were less likely to complete 90-day follow-up.

A different treatment paradigm to effectively clear HBV infection and eradicate latent viral reservoirs is urgently required. In recent years, the development of a new RNA-guided gene-editing tool, the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9) system, has greatly facilitated site-specific mutagenesis and represents a very promising potential therapeutic tool for diseases, including for eradication of invasive pathogens such as HBV. Here, we review recent advances in the use of CRISPR/Cas9, which is designed to target HBV specific DNA sequences to inhibit HBV replication and to induce viral genome mutation, in cell lines or animal models.

Given the scale and scope of increased globalization moving forward in a post-Millennium Development Goals era, to protect and realize health equity for all people, has never been more challenging or more important. The unprecedented nature of global interdependence underscores the importance of proposing policy solutions that advance realizing global responsibility for global health.--NEW SECTION--This article argues for advancing global responsibility for global health through the creation of a Global Fund for Health. It suggests harnessing the power of the exceptional response to the combined epidemics of AIDS, TB and Malaria, embodied in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to realize an expanded, reconceptualized Global Fund for Health. However this proposal creates both an analytical quandary embedded in conceptual pluralism and a practical dilemma for the scope and raison d'etre of a new Global Fund for Health. To address these issues we offer a logical framework for moving from conceptual pluralism in the theories supporting global responsibility for health to practical agreement on policy to realize this end. We examine how the innovations flowing from this exceptional response can be coupled with recent ideas and concepts, for example a global social protection floor, a Global Health Constitution or a Framework Convention for Global Health, that share the global responsibility logic that underpins a Global Fund for Health.--NEW SECTION--The 2014 Lancet Commission on Global Governance for Health Report asks whether a single global health protection fund would be better for global health than the current patchwork of global and national social transfers. We concur with this suggestion and argue that there is much room for practical agreement on a Global Fund for Health that moves from the conceptual level into policies and practice that advance global health. The issues of shared responsibility and mutual accountability feature widely in the post-2015 discussions and need to be addressed in a coherent manner. Our article argues why and how a Global Fund for Health effectuates this, thus advancing global responsibility for global health.",eng,BMC international health and human rights,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The first was distributed to current and prospective OBGYN residents interviewing at a US residency programme during 2012-2013. The second questionnaire distributed to US OBGYN programme directors assessed for existing global health programmes and global health training barriers. A composite Global Health Interest/Importance score was tabulated from the Likert scores. Multivariable linear regression was performed to assess for predictors of Global Health Interest/Importance.--NEW SECTION--A total of 159 trainees (77%; 129 prospective OBGYN residents and 30 residents) and 69 (28%) programme directors completed the questionnaires.

The rate of major GIB related to the use of some direct acting oral anticoagulant drugs (DOACs), is higher than that detected in warfarin users. Current strategies in the treatment of GIBs in patients receiving warfarin or DOACs (vitamin K, activated charcoal; hemodialysis; recombinant factor VIIa; [activated] prothrombin complex concentrates) including indications for the treatment of bleeding based on different degrees of severity of the episodes, is reported in this article. Potential preventive strategies to mitigate the risk of GIBs (e.g. upper endoscopy/biopsy, colon cancer screening; eradication of Helicobacter pylori prior to starting anticoagulation; use of proton-pump inhibitors, identification of risk factors for bleeding) are also reported as well as the fact that some of them have not been tested so far in patients receiving DOACs. Antidotes that experimentally reverse the anti-coagulant effect of dabigatran (Idarucizumab; BI 655075; Boehringer Ingelheim); of rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban (Andexanet alfa, r-Antidote, PRT064445; Portola Pharmaceuticals) or of all DOACs (Aripazine, PER-977, ciraparantag; Perosphere Inc.) are discussed. Likewise, population pharmacokinetics modeling related to the rate of major DOACs-related GIBs is presented. It is also emphasized that the occurrence of GIB reflects the presence of patients at the highest risk for adverse outcomes. Finally, the implications of the concept that patient characteristics and the severity of illness (i.e. comorbidities) exert a greater impact on the risk of GIB than the type of antithrombotic agent employed, are analyzed.",eng,Thrombosis research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26507227,10.1128/mBio.01024-15,"Inactivated Influenza Vaccine That Provides Rapid, Innate-Immune-System-Mediated Protection and Subsequent Long-Term Adaptive Immunity.","The continual threat to global health posed by influenza has led to increased efforts to improve the effectiveness of influenza vaccines for use in epidemics and pandemics. We show in this study that formulation of a low dose of inactivated detergent-split influenza vaccine with a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist-based lipopeptide adjuvant (R4Pam2Cys) provides (i) immediate, antigen-independent immunity mediated by the innate immune system and (ii) significant enhancement of antigen-dependent immunity which exhibits an increased breadth of effector function. Intranasal administration of mice with vaccine formulated with R4Pam2Cys but not vaccine alone provides protection against both homologous and serologically distinct (heterologous) viral strains within a day of administration. Vaccination in the presence of R4Pam2Cys subsequently also induces high levels of systemic IgM, IgG1, and IgG2b antibodies and pulmonary IgA antibodies that inhibit hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) activities of homologous but not heterologous virus. Improved primary virus nucleoprotein (NP)-specific CD8(+) T cell responses are also induced by the use of R4Pam2Cys and are associated with robust recall responses to provide heterologous protection. These protective effects are demonstrated in wild-type and antibody-deficient animals but not in those depleted of CD8(+) T cells. Using a contact-dependent virus transmission model, we also found that heterologous virus transmission from vaccinated mice to naive mice is significantly reduced. These results demonstrate the potential of adding a TLR2 agonist to an existing seasonal influenza vaccine to improve its utility by inducing immediate short-term nonspecific antiviral protection and also antigen-specific responses to provide homologous and heterologous immunity.--NEW SECTION--The innate and adaptive immune systems differ in mechanisms, specificities, and times at which they take effect. The innate immune system responds within hours of exposure to infectious agents, while adaptive immunity takes several days to become effective. Here we show, by using a simple lipopeptide-based TLR2 agonist, that an influenza detergent-split vaccine can be made to simultaneously stimulate and amplify both systems to provide immediate antiviral protection while giving the adaptive immune system time to implement long-term immunity. Both types of immunity induced by this approach protect against vaccine-matched as well as unrelated virus strains and potentially even against strains yet to be encountered. Conferring dual functionality to influenza vaccines is beneficial for improving community protection, particularly during periods between the onset of an outbreak and the time when a vaccine becomes available or in scenarios in which mass vaccination with a strain to which the population is immunologically naive is imperative.",eng,mBio,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Moreover, since the 2011 United Nations High-Level Meeting on NCDs, the international health and development community has shifted its awareness to include NCDs as a global health priority, especially in developing countries where mortality rates are disproportionately high. Simultaneously, with the dissemination of the World Cancer Declaration and the evolution of cancer control policies, the international cancer community has recognized the value of engaging patients in reducing the global cancer burden. Cancer advocacy programs that involve patients, survivors, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have increasing opportunities for global impact.--NEW SECTION--We developed a framework over 4 years through implementation of two pilot projects.

Previously, limited research suggested that the absolute number of deaths from stroke in women was greater than in men, but the incidence and mortality rates were greater in men. However, sex differences in various metrics of stroke burden on a global scale have not been a subject of comprehensive and comparable assessment for most regions of the world, nor have sex differences in stroke burden been examined for trends over time.--NEW SECTION--Stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and healthy years lost due to disability were estimated as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 Study. Data inputs included all available information on stroke incidence, prevalence and death and case fatality rates. Analysis was performed separately by sex and 5-year age categories for 188 countries. Statistical models were employed to produce globally comprehensive results over time. All rates were age-standardized to a global population and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were computed.--NEW SECTION--In 2013, global ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS) incidence (per 100,000) in men (IS 132.77 (95% UI 125.34-142.77); HS 64.89 (95% UI 59.82-68.85)) exceeded those of women (IS 98.85 (95% UI 92.11-106.62); HS 45.48 (95% UI 42.43-48.53)). IS incidence rates were lower in 2013 compared with 1990 rates for both sexes (1990 male IS incidence 147.40 (95% UI 137.87-157.66); 1990 female IS incidence 113.31 (95% UI 103.52-123.40)), but the only significant change in IS incidence was among women. Changes in global HS incidence were not statistically significant for males (1990 = 65.31 (95% UI 61.63-69.0), 2013 = 64.89 (95% UI 59.82-68.85)), but was significant for females (1990 = 64.892 (95% UI 59.82-68.85), 2013 = 45.48 (95% UI 42.427-48.53)).

The number of DALYs associated with HS also rose steadily and was higher than DALYs for IS at each time point (male 1990 = 29.91 (95% UI 25.66-34.54), male 2013 = 37.27 (95% UI 32.29-45.12); female 1990 = 26.05 (95% UI 21.70-30.90), female 2013 = 28.18 (95% UI 23.68-33.80)).--NEW SECTION--Globally, men continue to have a higher incidence of IS than women while significant sex differences in the incidence of HS were not observed. The total health loss due to stroke as measured by DALYs was similar for men and women for both stroke subtypes in 2013, with HS higher than IS. Both IS and HS DALYs show an increasing trend for both men and women since 1990, which is statistically significant only for IS among men. Ongoing monitoring of sex differences in the burden of stroke will be needed to determine if disease rates among men and women continue to diverge.

The present report addresses some of the core principles that could make stroke prevention work. The prevention of stroke shares many common features with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs); stroke prevention should therefore be part of the joint actions on NCD led by the WHO and member states. Stroke prevention is an integral part of both the 2011 UN declaration on actions on NCDs and the UN Post-2015 Sustainable Developmental Goals. Stroke prevention requires an intersectoral approach, with important responsibilities on the part of governmental bodies, non-government organizations and the health sector as well as communities, industries and individuals. Although official development assistance will need to be provided for the lowest income countries, financing will need to be raised for most countries by reallocation of resources within the country. Stroke is a prototype NCD in that there is overwhelming scientific evidence that with actions taken to reduce risk factors, the risk of stroke can be substantially reduced. Prevention of stroke will also have beneficial effects on cognitive decline and dementia. As most strokes do not lead to death, stroke statistics should not only focus on mortality, but also on disability and quality of life. All preventive actions should start early in life and continue during the life cycle. Prevention of stroke is a complex medical and a political issue with many challenges. Upscaling of efforts to prevent stroke are urgently needed in all regions, and the opportunity to act is now.",eng,Neuroepidemiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Ischemic heart disease and stroke remain the leading causes of premature death in the world; however, there is wide regional variation in these patterns. Some regions, led by Central Asia, face particularly high rates of premature death from ischemic heart disease. Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia suffer disproportionately from death from stroke. The purpose of the present report is to (1) describe global trends and regional variation in premature mortality attributable to CVD, (2) review past and current approaches to the measurement of these trends, and (3) describe the limitations of existing models of epidemiological transitions for explaining the observed distribution and trends of CVD mortality.

26498467,10.1007/s10728-015-0307-x,Imagining Global Health with Justice: In Defense of the Right to Health.,"The singular message in Global Health Law is that we must strive to achieve global health with justice--improved population health, with a fairer distribution of benefits of good health. Global health entails ensuring the conditions of good health--public health, universal health coverage, and the social determinants of health--while justice requires closing today’s vast domestic and global health inequities. These conditions for good health should be incorporated into public policy, supplemented by specific actions to overcome barriers to equity. A new global health treaty grounded in the right to health and aimed at health equity--a Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH)--stands out for its possibilities in helping to achieve global health with justice. This far-reaching legal instrument would establish minimum standards for universal health coverage and public health measures, with an accompanying national and international financing framework, require a constant focus on health equity, promote Health in All Policies and global governance for health, and advance the principles of good governance, including accountability. While achieving an FCGH is certainly ambitious, it is a struggle worth the efforts of us all. The treaty’s basis in the right to health, which has been agreed to by all governments, has powerful potential to form the foundation of global governance for health. From interpretations of UN treaty bodies to judgments of national courts, the right to health is now sufficiently articulated to serve this role, with the individual’s right to health best understood as a function of a social, political, and economic environment aimed at equity. However great the political challenge of securing state agreement to the FCGH, it is possible. States have joined other treaties with significant resource requirements and limitations on their sovereignty without significant reciprocal benefits from other states, while important state interests would benefit from the FCGH. And from integrating the FCGH into the existing human rights system to creative forms of compliance and enforcement and strengthened domestic legal and political accountability mechanisms, the treaty stands to improve right to health compliance. The potential for the FCGH to bring the right to health nearer universal reality calls for us to embark on the journey towards securing this global treaty.",eng,Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26498010,10.4132/jptm.2015.09.10,Molecular Dimensions of Gastric Cancer: Translational and Clinical Perspectives.,"Gastric cancer is a global health burden and has the highest incidence in East Asia. This disease is complex in nature because it arises from multiple interactions of genetic, local environmental, and host factors, resulting in biological heterogeneity. This genetic intricacy converges on molecular characteristics reflecting the pathophysiology, tumor biology, and clinical outcome. Therefore, understanding the molecular characteristics at a genomic level is pivotal to improving the clinical care of patients with gastric cancer. A recent landmark study, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, showed the molecular landscape of gastric cancer through a comprehensive molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric cancers. The proposed molecular classification divided gastric cancer into four subtypes: Epstein-Barr virus-positive, microsatellite unstable, genomic stable, and chromosomal instability. This information will be taken into account in future clinical trials and will be translated into clinical therapeutic decisions. To fully realize the clinical benefit, many challenges must be overcome. Rapid growth of high-throughput biology and functional validation of molecular targets will further deepen our knowledge of molecular dimensions of this cancer, allowing for personalized precision medicine.",eng,Journal of pathology and translational medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Certain populations such as the Northeast Indians suffer at a disproportionately higher rate from this devastating disease. Promoter methylation is correlated with transcriptional silencing of various genes in esophageal cancer. Very few studies on genome-wide methylation for esophageal cancer exist and yet, no one has carried out an integromics analysis of methylation and gene expression. In the present study, genome-wide methylation was measured in samples collected from the Northeast Indian population by Infinium 450k array, and integration of the methylation data was performed. To prepare a network of genes displaying enriched pathways, together with the list of genes exhibiting promoter hypermethylation or hypomethylation with inversely correlated expression, we performed an integrome analysis. We identified 23 Integrome network enriched genes with relevance to tumor progression and associated with the processes involved in metastasis such as cell adhesion, integrin signaling, cytoskeleton, and extracellular matrix organizations. These included four genes (PTK2, RND1, RND3, and UBL3) with promoter hypermethylation and downregulation, and 19 genes (SEMG2, CD97, CTNND2, CADM3, OMD, NEFM, FBN2, CTNNB1, DLX6, UGT2B4, CCDC80, PZP, SERPINA4, TNFSF13B, NPC1, COL1A1, TAC3, BMP8A, and IL22RA2) with promoter hypomethylation and upregulation. A Methylation Efficiency Index was further calculated for these genes; the top five gene with the highest index were COL1A1, TAC3, SERPINA4, TNFSF13B, and IL22RA2. In conclusion, we recommend that the circulatory proteins IL22RA2, TNFSF13B, SERPINA4, and TAC3 in serum of patients and disease-free healthy controls can be examined in the future as putative noninvasive biomarkers.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Red and white blood cell counts can also be performed on human body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, and peritoneal fluid. The approach consists of using a compact, custom-built microscope to record large field-of-view, bright-field, and fluorescence images of samples that are stained with a single dye and using automatic algorithms to count blood cells and detect hemoglobin. The total process takes about 15 min, including 5 min for sample preparation, and 10 min for data collection and analysis. The minimum volume of blood needed for the test is 0.5 μL, which allows for minimally invasive sample collection such as using a finger prick rather than a venous draw. Blood counts were compared to gold-standard automated clinical instruments, with excellent agreement between the two methods as determined by a Bland-Altman analysis. Accuracy of counts on body fluids was consistent with hand counting by a trained clinical lab scientist, where our instrument demonstrated an approximately 100-fold lower limit of detection compared to current automated methods. The combination of a compact, custom-built instrument, simple sample collection and preparation, and automated analysis demonstrates that this approach could benefit global health through use in low-resource settings where central hematology laboratories are not accessible.",eng,Analytical chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Few accounts are available of that significant yet cloistered synthesis process: none contemporaneous. In contrast, this study examines health's evolving location in the first-phase of the next iteration of global development goal negotiation for the post-2015 era, through the synchronous perspectives of representatives of key multilateral and related organizations. As part of the Go4Health Project, in-depth interviews were conducted in mid-2013 with 57 professionals working on health and the post-2015 agenda within multilaterals and related agencies. Using discourse analysis, this article reports the results and analysis of a Universal Health Coverage (UHC) theme: contextualizing UHC's positioning within the post-2015 agenda-setting process immediately after the Global Thematic Consultation on Health and High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda (High-Level Panel) released their post-2015 health and development goal aspirations in April and May 2013, respectively. After the findings from the interview data analysis are presented, the Results will be discussed drawing on Shiffman and Smith (Generation of political priority for global health initiatives: a framework and case study of maternal mortality.The Lancet2007; 370: : 1370-79) agenda-setting analytical framework (examining ideas, issues, actors and political context), modified by Benzianet al.(2011). Although more participants support the High-Level Panel's May 2013 report's proposal-'Ensure Healthy Lives'-as the next umbrella health goal, they nevertheless still emphasize the need for UHC to achieve this and thus be incorporated as part of its trajectory. Despite UHC's conceptual ambiguity and cursory mention in the High-Level Panel report, its proponents suggest its re-emergence will occur in forthcoming State led post-2015 negotiations. However, the final post-2015 SDG framework for UN General Assembly endorsement in September 2015 confirms UHC's continued distillation in negotiations, as UHC ultimately became one of a litany of targets within the proposed global health goal.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We analyzed data from 538 patients emergently hospitalized for acute LGIB. We used propensity score matching to adjust for differences between patients who underwent early colonoscopy vs elective colonoscopy. Outcomes included rates of adverse events during bowel preparation and colonoscopy procedures, stigmata of recent hemorrhage, endoscopic therapy, blood transfusion requirement, 30-day rebleeding and mortality, and length of hospital stay.--NEW SECTION--We selected 163 pairs of patients for analysis on the basis of propensity matching. We observed no significant differences between the early and elective colonoscopy groups in bowel preparation-related rates of adverse events (1.8% vs 1.2%, P = .652), colonoscopy-related rates of adverse events (none in either group), blood transfusion requirement (27.6% vs 27.6%, P = 1.000), or mortality (1.2% vs 0, P = .156). The early colonoscopy group had higher rates than the elective group for stigmata of recent hemorrhage (26.4% vs 9.2%, P < .001) and endoscopic therapy (25.8% vs 8.6%, P < .001), including clipping (17.8% vs 4.9%, P < .001), band ligation (6.1% vs 1.8%, P = .048), and rebleeding (13.5% vs 7.4%, P = .070). Patients in the early colonoscopy group stayed in the hospital for a shorter mean time (10 days) than patients in the elective colonoscopy group (13 days) (P < .001).--NEW SECTION--Early colonoscopy for patients with acute LGIB is safe, allows for endoscopic therapy because it identifies the bleeding source, and reduces hospital stay.

Compared with standard regimens, lower-dose regimens appeared equally as good in terms of preventing seizures [odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-2.28, 899 women, four studies], maternal morbidity (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.32-0.71, 796 women, three studies), and fetal and/or neonatal mortality (OR 0.87, 95%CI 0.38-2.00, 800 women, four studies). Comparison of loading dose only with maintenance dose regimens showed no differences in seizure rates (OR 0.99, 95%CI 0.22-4.50, 146 women, two studies), maternal morbidity (OR 0.53, 95%CI 0.15-1.93, 146 women, two studies), maternal mortality (OR 0.63, 95%CI 0.05-7.50, 146 women, two studies), and fetal and/or neonatal mortality (OR 0.49, 95%CI 0.23-1.03, 146 women, two studies).--NEW SECTION--Lower-dose and loading dose-only regimens could be as safe and efficacious as standard regimens; however, this evidence comes from low to very low quality studies and further high quality studies are needed.",eng,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26485047,10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.10.025,β-glucan microparticles targeted to epithelial APN as oral antigen delivery system.,"Enteric diseases still have a devastating impact on global health. Oral vaccination is crucial to prevent intestinal infections, since only vaccines delivered to the intestinal tract elicit potent immune responses at the site of pathogen entry. However, oral vaccines encounter multiple barriers, including poor uptake and tolerance mechanisms, preventing the immune system to react to innocuous environmental antigens. Antigen delivery systems combined with selective targeting seem a promising strategy to overcome these obstacles. The current study evaluates the capacity of aminopeptidase N (APN)-targeted β-glucan microparticles (GPs) as antigen delivery system. Antibodies against APN, an intestinal epithelial receptor, are efficiently oriented conjugated to GPs via the biolinker protein G. The resultant microparticles were analyzed for their antigen load, adjuvanticity and interaction with enterocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). Functionalization of GPs with antibodies neither impedes antigen load nor adjuvanticity. In addition, targeting to APN increases the uptake of microparticles by enterocytes and DCs, leading to an enhanced maturation of the latter as evidenced by an upregulation of maturation markers and a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Finally, oral administration of APN-targeted antigen-loaded particles to piglets elicits higher serum antigen-specific antibody responses as compared to control particles. Taken together, these data support the use of APN-targeted GPs for oral delivery of antigens.",eng,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

As such, it is crucial to explore factors related to the accuracy of children's reports of what they consumed.--NEW SECTION--The objective was to evaluate factors related to the accuracy of self-reported dietary intake information elicited by interview methods from children aged 6 to 12 years.--NEW SECTION--A systematic review of English articles using PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PsycEXTRA, PsycBOOKS, CINAHL Complete, Global Health, and MEDLINE Complete was performed. Search terms included interview, diet, children, and recall; studies were limited to those published from 1970 onward. Additional studies were identified using the reference lists of published articles. Studies that assessed children's dietary intake using direct observation, doubly labeled water, or the double-portion method and compared it with their recall of that intake (unassisted by parents) using an interview were included.--NEW SECTION--The 45 studies that met the inclusion criteria showed that specific interview techniques designed to enhance children's recall accuracy had little effect. Rather, the timing of the interview appeared most important: The shorter the retention interval between children's consumption and their recall, the more accurate their memories. Children's age, body mass index, social desirability, food preferences, and cognitive ability were also related to accuracy.--NEW SECTION--Factors related to the accuracy of children's dietary reporting should be taken into consideration when asking about consumption. Further research is required to examine whether other interview techniques, such as those developed to enhance children's recall of repeated staged events, can improve children's dietary reporting accuracy.",eng,Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In this connection, Brucella melitensis is an intracellular bacterium that causes the zoonotic infectious disease, brucellosis. Presently, no licensed vaccines are available for human brucellosis. Here, we report the identification of potential vaccine candidates against B. melitensis using a reverse vaccinology approach. Based on a systematic screening of exoproteome and secretome of B. melitensis 16 M, we identified eight proteins as potential vaccine candidates, including LPS-assembly protein LptD, a polysaccharide export protein, a cell surface protein, heme transporter BhuA, flagellin FliC, 7-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, immunoglobulin-binding protein EIBE, and hemagglutinin. Among these, the roles of BhuA and hemagglutinin in the virulence of Brucella are essential to establish infection. Roles of other proteins in the virulence are yet to be studied. Prediction of protein-protein interactions revealed that these proteins can interact with other proteins involved in virulence, secretion system, metabolism, and transport. From these eight potential vaccine candidates, we predicted three surface exposed novel antigenic epitopes that can induce both B-cell and T-cell immune responses. These peptides can be used for the development of either exclusive peptide vaccines or multi-component vaccines against human brucellosis. Reverse vaccinology is an important strategy for discovery of novel global health therapeutics.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We also obtained reports from Abt Associates, through contacts in individual countries and through an online search. We compiled data in the four main types used in these reports: (i) financing source; (ii) financing agent; (iii) health function; and (iv) health provider. We combined and adjusted data to conform with OECD's first edition of A system of health accounts manual, (2000).--NEW SECTION--We identified 872 NHA reports from 117 countries containing a total of 2936 matrices for the four data types. Most countries did not provide complete health expenditure data: only 252 of the 872 reports contained data in all four types. Thirty-eight countries reported an average not-specified-by-kind value greater than 20% for all data types and years.

Carotid-intima media thickness (cIMT) is a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis that may be used to assess CVD risk in young people. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between adiposity and cIMT in children and adolescents.--NEW SECTION--We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health, and CINAHL Plus electronic databases (1980-2014). Population-based observational studies that reported a measure of association between objectively-measured adiposity and cIMT in childhood were included in this review.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-two cross-sectional studies were included (n = 7,366 children and adolescents). Thirteen of nineteen studies conducted in adolescent populations (mean age ≥ 12 years, n = 5,986) reported positive associations between cIMT and adiposity measures (correlation coefficients 0.13 to 0.59). Three studies of pre-adolescent populations (n = 1,380) reported mixed evidence, two studies finding no evidence of a correlation, and one an inverse relationship between skinfolds and cIMT. Included studies did not report an adiposity threshold for subclinical atherosclerosis.--NEW SECTION--Based on studies conducted mostly in Western Europe and the US, adiposity does not appear to be associated with cIMT in pre-adolescents, but may be associated in adolescents. If further studies confirm these findings, a focus on cardiovascular disease prevention efforts in pre-adolescence, before arterial changes have emerged, may be justified.",eng,BMC pediatrics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

It is well documented that stress increases the incidences of various cardiovascular disorders. Regular exercise is known to reduce resting blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). This study was designed to clarify the effects of long-term exercise on stress-evoked cardiovascular responses and to emphasize post-stress recovery effects. Male Wistar rats underwent 8 weeks of moderate treadmill training, with cardiovascular responses, autonomic nervous system activities and local Fos reactivity changes in the cardiovascular regulation center were monitored before, during and after immobilization stress. A spectral analysis of cardiovascular parameters was used to examine autonomic nervous activities. We found that long-term exercise (i) lowered resting BP, HR and sympathetic activity, but increased resting parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS); (ii) accelerated post-stress recovery of stress-evoked cardiovascular and sympathetic responses along with increased BRS and (iii) accelerated post-stress recovery of stress-evoked neuron activations in the paraventricular nucleus, but delayed it in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius.

We also analyzed the incubation period, serial interval, the characteristics of superspreaders, and factors associated with mortality. Full genome sequence was obtained from sputum specimens of the index patient.--NEW SECTION--A total of 186 confirmed patients with MERS-CoV infection across 16 hospitals were identified in the Republic of Korea. Some 44.1% of the cases were patients exposed in hospitals, 32.8% were caregivers, and 13.4% were healthcare personnel. The most common presenting symptom was fever and chills.

These metals often occur as mixtures in the environment, creating the potential for interactive or synergistic biological effects different from those observed in single exposure conditions. In the present study, environmental mixtures collected from two waste sites in China and comparable mixtures prepared in the laboratory were tested for toxicogenomic response in placental JEG-3 cells. These cells serve as a model for evaluating cellular responses to exposures during pregnancy. One of the mixtures was predominated by iAs and one by Cd. Six gene biomarkers were measured in order to evaluate the effects from the metal mixtures using dose and time-course experiments including: heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and metallothionein isoforms (MT1A, MT1F and MT1G) previously shown to be preferentially induced by exposure to either iAs or Cd, and metal transporter genes aquaporin-9 (AQP9) and ATPase, Cu(2+) transporting, beta polypeptide (ATP7B). There was a significant increase in the mRNA expression levels of ATP7B, HO-1, MT1A, MT1F, and MT1G in mixture-treated cells compared to the iAs or Cd only-treated cells. Notably, the genomic responses were observed at concentrations significantly lower than levels found at the environmental collection sites. These data demonstrate that metal mixtures increase the expression of gene biomarkers in placental JEG-3 cells in a synergistic manner.

We conducted a systematic review to investigate the acceptability, yield and prevalence of HIV testing and counselling (HTC) strategies in children and adolescents (5 to 19 years) in sub-Saharan Africa.--NEW SECTION--An electronic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and conference abstract databases. Studies reporting on HTC acceptability, yield and prevalence and published between January 2004 and September 2014 were included. Pooled proportions for these three outcomes were estimated using a random effects model. A quality assessment was conducted on included studies.--NEW SECTION--A total of 16,380 potential citations were identified, of which 21 studies (23 entries) were included. Most studies were conducted in Kenya (n=5) and Uganda (n=5) and judged to provide moderate (n=15) to low quality (n=7) evidence, with data not disaggregated by age. Seven studies reported on provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC), with the remainder reporting on family-centred (n=5), home-based (n=5), outreach (n=5) and school-linked HTC among primary schoolchildren (n=1).

26468529,10.1128/JVI.01849-15,The Phosphatidylserine and Phosphatidylethanolamine Receptor CD300a Binds Dengue Virus and Enhances Infection.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the etiological agent of the major human arboviral disease. We previously demonstrated that the TIM and TAM families of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) receptors involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells mediate DENV entry into target cells. We show here that human CD300a, a recently identified phospholipid receptor, also binds directly DENV particles and enhances viral entry. CD300a facilitates infection of the four DENV serotypes, as well as of other mosquito-borne viruses such as West Nile virus and Chikungunya virus. CD300a acts as an attachment factor that enhances DENV internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. CD300a recognizes predominantly phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEth) and to a lesser extent PtdSer associated with viral particles. Mutation of residues in the IgV domain critical for phospholipid binding abrogate CD300a-mediated enhancement of DENV infection. Finally, we show that CD300a is expressed at the surface of primary macrophages and anti-CD300a polyclonal antibodies partially inhibited DENV infection of these cells. Overall, these data indicate that CD300a is a novel DENV binding receptor that recognizes PtdEth and PtdSer present on virions and enhance infection.--NEW SECTION--Dengue disease, caused by dengue virus (DENV), has emerged as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans and is a major global health concern. The molecular bases of DENV-host cell interactions during virus entry are poorly understood, hampering the discovery of new targets for antiviral intervention. We recently discovered that the TIM and TAM proteins, two receptor families involved in the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer)-dependent phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells, interact with DENV particles-associated PtdSer through a mechanism that mimics the recognition of apoptotic cells and mediate DENV infection. In this study, we show that CD300a, a novel identified phospholipid receptor, mediates DENV infection. CD300a-dependent DENV infection relies on the direct recognition of phosphatidylethanolamine and to a lesser extent PtdSer associated with viral particles. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms that mediate DENV entry and reinforce the concept that DENV uses an apoptotic mimicry strategy for viral entry.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26468324,10.1126/scitranslmed.aac4241,Prefusion F-specific antibodies determine the magnitude of RSV neutralizing activity in human sera.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is estimated to claim more lives among infants <1 year old than any other single pathogen, except malaria, and poses a substantial global health burden. Viral entry is mediated by a type I fusion glycoprotein (F) that transitions from a metastable prefusion (pre-F) to a stable postfusion (post-F) trimer. A highly neutralization-sensitive epitope, antigenic site Ø, is found only on pre-F. We determined what fraction of neutralizing (NT) activity in human sera is dependent on antibodies specific for antigenic site Ø or other antigenic sites on F in healthy subjects from ages 7 to 93 years. Adsorption of individual sera with stabilized pre-F protein removed >90% of NT activity and depleted binding antibodies to both F conformations. In contrast, adsorption with post-F removed ~30% of NT activity, and binding antibodies to pre-F were retained. These findings were consistent across all age groups. Protein competition neutralization assays with pre-F mutants in which sites Ø or II were altered to knock out binding of antibodies to the corresponding sites showed that these sites accounted for ~35 and <10% of NT activity, respectively. Binding competition assays with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) indicated that the amount of site Ø-specific antibodies correlated with NT activity, whereas the magnitude of binding competed by site II mAbs did not correlate with neutralization. Our results indicate that RSV NT activity in human sera is primarily derived from pre-F-specific antibodies, and therefore, inducing or boosting NT activity by vaccination will be facilitated by using pre-F antigens that preserve site Ø.",eng,Science translational medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The Mexican Popular Health Insurance (PHI) is widely presented as a UHC success case to be followed. This article reviews critically its achievements after a decade of implementation. It shows that universal coverage has not been reached and about 30 million Mexicans are uninsured. Access to needed services is quite limited for PHI affiliates given the restrictions of the service package, which excludes common high-cost diseases, and the lack of health facilities. Public health expenditure has increased 0.36 percent of Gross National Product, favoring the PHI at the expense of public social security. These funds are, however, lower than legal specifications and the service package under-priced. Private health expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure has not varied much and PHI affiliates' out-of-pocket payment is larger than the whole PHI budget. There is no evidence of health impact. The Mexican health reform corresponds to neoclassic-neoliberal reorganization of society on the market principle. Although some of the PHI problems are particular to Mexico, it illustrates some of the overall flaws of the UHC model.",eng,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Pathogenic potential of bacteria has been shown to be context dependent, varying in response to environment and even within the strains of the same genus.--NEW SECTION--We used the KEGG repository and extensive literature searches to identify among the 2527 bacterial genomes in the literature those implicated as pathogenic to the host, including those which show pathogenicity in a context dependent manner. Using data on the gene contents of these genomes, we identified sets of genes highly abundant in pathogenic but relatively absent in commensal strains and vice versa. In addition, we carried out genome comparison within a genus for the seventeen largest genera in our genome collection. We projected the resultant lists of ortholog genes onto KEGG bacterial pathways to identify clusters and circuits, which can be linked to either pathogenicity or synergy. Gene circuits relatively abundant in nonpathogenic bacteria often mediated biosynthesis of antibiotics. Other synergy-linked circuits reduced drug-induced toxicity. Pathogen-abundant gene circuits included modules in one-carbon folate, two-component system, type-3 secretion system, and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Antibiotics-resistant bacterial strains possessed genes modulating phagocytosis, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal reorganization, and regulation of the inflammatory response. Our study also identified bacterial genera containing a circuit, elements of which were previously linked to Alzheimer's disease.--NEW SECTION--Present study produces for the first time, a signature, in the form of a robust list of gene circuitry whose presence or absence could potentially define the pathogenicity of a microbiome. Extensive literature search substantiated a bulk majority of the commensal and pathogenic circuitry in our predicted list. Scanning microbiome libraries for these circuitry motifs will provide further insights into the complex and context dependent pathogenicity of bacteria.",eng,BMC genomics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26459643,10.1542/peds.2015-1400,Childhood Health and Developmental Outcomes After Cesarean Birth in an Australian Cohort.,"Concerns have been raised about associations between cesarean delivery and childhood obesity and asthma. However, published studies have not examined the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes or fully addressed confounding influences. We used data from the LSAC (Longitudinal Study of Australian Children) to explore the relationship between cesarean delivery and physical and socio-emotional outcomes from 0 to 7 years, taking into account confounding factors.--NEW SECTION--Data were from 5 waves of LSAC representing 5107 children born in 2003 and 2004. Outcome measures included: global health, asthma, BMI, use of prescribed medication, general development, medical conditions and/or disabilities, special health care needs, and socio-emotional development. Models adjusted for birth factors, social vulnerability, maternal BMI, and breastfeeding.--NEW SECTION--Children born by cesarean delivery were more likely to have a medical condition at 2 to 3 years (odds ratio: 1.33; P = .03), use prescribed medication at 6 to 7 years (odds ratio: 1.26; P = .04), and have a higher BMI at 8 to 9 years (coefficient: 0.08; P = .05), although this last effect was mediated by maternal obesity. Parent-reported quality of life for children born by cesarean delivery was lower at 8 to 9 years (coefficient: -0.08; P = .03) but not at younger ages. Contrasting this finding, cesarean delivery was associated with better parent-reported global health at 2 to 3 years (odds ratio: 1.23; P = .05) and prosocial skills at age 6 to 7 years (coefficient: 0.09; P = .02).--NEW SECTION--Cesarean delivery was associated with a mix of positive and negative outcomes across early childhood, but overall there were few associations, and these were not consistent across the 5 waves. This study does not support a strong association between cesarean delivery and poorer health or neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood.",eng,Pediatrics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Mortality from acute N. meningitidis infections remains high despite antibiotics, and brucellosis presents alimentary and health consequences. Superoxide dismutases are master regulators of reactive oxygen and general pathogenicity factors and are therefore therapeutic targets. Cu,Zn superoxide dismutases (SODs) localized to the periplasm promote survival by detoxifying superoxide radicals generated by major host antimicrobial immune responses. We discovered that passive immunization with an antibody directed at N. meningitidis SOD (NmSOD) was protective in a mouse infection model. To define the relevant atomic details and solution assembly states of this important virulence factor, we report high-resolution and X-ray scattering analyses of NmSOD and of SOD from B. abortus (BaSOD). The NmSOD structures revealed an auxiliary tetrahedral Cu-binding site bridging the dimer interface; mutational analyses suggested that this metal site contributes to protein stability, with implications for bacterial defense mechanisms. Biochemical and structural analyses informed us about electrostatic substrate guidance, dimer assembly, and an exposed C-terminal epitope in the NmSOD dimer. In contrast, the monomeric BaSOD structure provided insights for extending immunogenic peptide epitopes derived from the protein. These collective results reveal unique contributions of SOD to pathogenic virulence, refine predictive motifs for distinguishing SOD classes, and suggest general targets for antibacterial immune responses. The identified functional contributions, motifs, and targets distinguishing bacterial and eukaryotic SOD assemblies presented here provide a foundation for efforts to develop SOD-specific inhibitors of or vaccines against these harmful pathogens.--NEW SECTION--By protecting microbes against reactive oxygen insults, SODs aid survival of many bacteria within their hosts. Despite the ubiquity and conservation of these key enzymes, notable species-specific differences relevant to pathogenesis remain undefined. To probe mechanisms that govern the functioning of Neisseria meningitidis and Brucella abortus SODs, we used X-ray structures, enzymology, modeling, and murine infection experiments. We identified virulence determinants common to the two homologs, assembly differences, and a unique metal reservoir within meningococcal SOD that stabilizes the enzyme and may provide a safeguard against copper toxicity. The insights reported here provide a rationale and a basis for SOD-specific drug design and an extension of immunogen design to target two important pathogens that continue to pose global health threats.",eng,Journal of bacteriology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The period after the birth of a first baby is a time of great changes and disruptions to many aspects of the mother's physical, psychological and social functioning. This can lead to feelings of distress, a sense of incompetence and helplessness. This study aimed to examine: (1) the psychometric properties of the Demoralisation Scale in a community setting; (2) the prevalence of demoralisation symptoms among primiparous women in the community; and (3) factors that are uniquely associated with demoralisation in the early postnatal period.--NEW SECTION--Primiparous women attending community maternal health centres (n = 400) were recruited and administered the study's questionnaires through a telephone interview.--NEW SECTION--The Demoralisation Scale was found to be a reliable and valid tool among women in the community who had recently given birth. Higher levels of demoralisation were independently associated with lower confidence on going home from the hospital after birth, lower rating of mother's self-rated global health, more than 3 h of infant crying and fussing in the last 24 h, and a controlling partner, after symptoms of depression and anxiety, and vulnerable personality characteristics were controlled for.--NEW SECTION--The relevance of demoralisation to postnatal health practitioners in the community is in helping them to better understand women's experiences and to intervene in a way that is more meaningful and less stigmatising to women.",eng,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Prebiotic and probiotic strategies are thought to be useful in the context of experimental IBD. Here, we compared the effects of preventive versus therapeutic treatment with a high fiber diet (prebiotic) in combination or not with Bifidobacterium longum (probiotic) in a murine model of chronic colitis.--NEW SECTION--Colitis was induced by adding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to drinking water for 6 days (acute colitis) or for 5 cycles of DSS (chronic colitis).--NEW SECTION--Administration of the high fiber diet protected from acute colitis. Protection was optimal when diet was started 20 days prior to DSS. A 5-day pretreatment with acetate, a short-chain fatty acid, provided partial protection against acute colitis. In chronic colitis, pretreatment with the high fiber diet attenuated clinical and inflammatory parameters of disease. However, when the treatment with the high fiber diet started after disease had been established, overall protection was minimal. Similarly, delayed treatment with acetate or B. longum did not provide any protection even when the probiotic was associated with the high fiber diet.--NEW SECTION--Preventive use of a high fiber diet or acetate clearly protects mice against acute and chronic damage induced by DSS in mice. However, protection is lost when therapies are initiated after disease has been established. These results suggest that any therapy aimed at modifying the gut environment (e.g., prebiotic or probiotic strategies) should be given early in the course of disease.",eng,European journal of nutrition,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Major disease-control programs have greatly reduced both disease and infection prevalence by mass distribution of donated ivermectin. Recent studies have shown that local elimination was achieved in some areas following many years of ivermectin. The global health community has recently decided to build on these successes with a new program that aims to eliminate onchocerciasis. Diagnostic tests that were useful for identifying priority areas for disease prevention may not be adequate tools for elimination programs. This paper reviews available and emerging diagnostic tests for onchocerciasis and considers how they might be best employed during different stages of onchocerciasis elimination programs.,eng,Trends in parasitology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Reactivation of disease can affect the management of CD and its clinical outcome, adding pressure to global health systems because it exacerbates symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis and delays in the administration of correct treatments. Concurrent infections complicate the issue of reactivation, because there are various parasites and disease treatment regimens that are able to influence or suppress the immune system of the host, reactivating disease within infected individuals.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork between 2010 and 2012, in this article I explore efforts by a small-scale public-private partnership to use private veterinarians to sustainably control zoonotic sleeping sickness in Uganda. With a fundamental tension between business incentives and vector control, I show how divergences in knowledge, power, values, and social norms shaped project implementation and community responses. Reflecting more widely on the relationships between project plans and local realities, I argue that these encounters reveal the heuristic value in approaching global health interventions as evolving 'social experiments.'

The objective of this report is to analyze the experiences of cities in implementing Urban HEART in order to inform how the future development of the tool could support local stakeholders better in addressing health inequities. The study method is documentary analysis from independent evaluations and city implementation reports submitted to WHO. Independent evaluations were conducted in 2011-12 on Urban HEART piloting in 15 cities from seven countries in Asia and Africa: Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Mongolia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. Local or national health departments led Urban HEART piloting in 12 of the 15 cities. Other stakeholders commonly engaged included the city council, budget and planning departments, education sector, urban planning department, and the Mayor's office. Ten of the 12 core indicators recommended in Urban HEART were collected by at least 10 of the 15 cities. Improving access to safe water and sanitation was a priority equity-oriented intervention in 12 of the 15 cities, while unemployment was addressed in seven cities. Cities who piloted Urban HEART displayed confidence in its potential by sustaining or scaling up its use within their countries. Engagement of a wider group of stakeholders was more likely to lead to actions for improving health equity. Indicators that were collected were more likely to be acted upon. Quality of data for neighbourhoods within cities was one of the major issues. As local governments and stakeholders around the world gain greater control of decisions regarding their health, Urban HEART could prove to be a valuable tool in helping them pursue the goal of health equity.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2015

Similar clinical manifestations, transmission vectors, geographical distribution, and seasonal correlation often result in misdiagnosis of chikungunya infections as dengue cases and vice versa. In this study, we developed a rapid and accurate laboratory confirmative method to simultaneously detect, quantify, and differentiate DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 and CHIKV. This SYBR Green I-based one-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay is highly sensitive and specific for CHIKV and DENV. Melting temperature analysis of PCR amplicons was used to serotype DENV and to differentiate from CHIKV. The detection limit of the assay was 20, 10, 50, 5, and 10 RNA copies/reaction for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, and CHIKV, respectively. Our assay did not cross-react with a panel of viruses that included other flaviviruses, alphaviruses, influenza viruses, human enteroviruses, and human coronaviruses. The feasibility of using this assay for clinical diagnosis was evaluated in DENV- and CHIKV-positive patient sera. Accordingly, the assay sensitivity for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, and CHIKV was 89.66%, 96.67%, 96.67%, 94.12%, and 95.74%, respectively, with 100% specificity.

We evaluated the results of the largest self-reported survey of patients with PID to determine the factors that may contribute to differences in PH.--NEW SECTION--Data from a National Survey of Patients with Primary Immune Deficiency Diseases conducted by the Immune Deficiency Foundation was studied. Multivariate logistic regression was employed for data analysis.--NEW SECTION--Thirty percent of the patients perceived their health status as excellent or very good (EVG), 31 % as good (G), and 39 % as fair, poor or very poor (P). Older patients were less likely to have EVG-PH compared to G-PH. Ones with college degrees were more likely to have P-PH compared to G-PH, and less likely to have EVG-PH. Patients who were acutely ill and hospitalized in the past 12 months, ones with limited activity, and chronic diseases, were more likely to have P-PH compared to G-PH. Patients with ""on demand"" access to specialty care and ones on regular IVIG had higher OR of having EVG-PH as opposed to G-PH. Patients cared for mostly by an immunologist were less likely to have P-PH compared to G-PH.--NEW SECTION--Our results emphasize the importance of PH in clinical practice.

Although multiple factors undoubtedly contribute to the development and progression of DM and obesity, research over the last decade has demonstrated that the microbes that colonize the human gut may play key contributory roles. Gut microbes are now known to codevelop with the human host and are strongly influenced by mode of birth and early diet and nutrition, as well as environmental and other factors including antibiotic exposure. Gut microbes contribute to human health through roles in polysaccharide breakdown, nutrient absorption, inflammatory responses, gut permeability, and bile acid modification. Numerous studies have suggested that disruptions in the relative proportions of gut microbial populations may contribute to weight gain and insulin resistance, including alterations in Gammaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia and the ratios of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in weight gain and possible alterations in butyrate-producing bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in DM. In addition, it has been shown that the methanogenic Archaea may contribute to altered metabolism and weight gain in the host. However, the majority of studies are performed with stool or colonic samples and may not be representative of the metabolically active small intestine. Studies predominantly in rodent models are beginning to elucidate the mechanisms by which gut microbes contribute to DM and obesity, but much remains to be learned before we can begin to approach targeted treatments.",eng,Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We start with a country-based (bottom-up) analysis of the costs and impact of scaling up reproductive, maternal, and child health tools, and select HIV and malaria interventions. We then incorporate global (top-down) analyses of the costs and impacts of scaling up existing tools for tuberculosis, additional HIV interventions, the costs to strengthen health systems, and the costs and benefits from scaling up new health interventions over the time horizon of this forecast. These data are then allocated to individual countries to provide an aggregate projection of potential cost and impact at the country level.

Herein, we report a library of amino acid tunable lipidated norspermidine conjugates that were prepared by conjugating both amino acids and fatty acids with the amine functionalities of norspermidine through amide bond formation. These lipidated conjugates displayed potent antibacterial activity against various planktonic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including drug-resistant superbugs such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and β-lactam-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. This class of nontoxic and fast-acting antibacterial molecules (capable of killing bacteria within 15 min) did not allow bacteria to develop resistance against them after several passages. Most importantly, an optimized compound in the series was also capable of killing metabolically inactive persisters and stationary phase bacteria. Additionally, this compound was capable of disrupting the preformed biofilms of S. aureus and E. coli.

These can be addressed by combining targeted affinity enrichment of antibodies with the sensitivity of liquid chromatography-selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-SRM MS). However, many virulence factors have evolved properties that make specific detection by conventional antibodies difficult. We here present an antibody format that is particularly well suited for detection and analysis of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding virulence factors. As proof of concept, we have generated single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies that specifically target the IgG-binding surface proteins M1 and H of Streptococcus pyogenes. The binding ability of the developed scFv is demonstrated against both recombinant soluble protein M1 and H as well as the intact surface proteins on a wild-type S. pyogenes strain. Additionally, the capacity of the developed scFv antibodies to enrich their target proteins from both simple and complex backgrounds, thereby allowing for detection and quantification with LC-SRM MS, was demonstrated.

We provide a scenario that includes the impact of alcohol on HIV/AIDS incidence, and qualitative predictions on future exposure and harm.--NEW SECTION--Overall, alcohol consumption has a large impact on burden of disease and mortality in African countries. Alcohol-attributable disease burden is more important when the impact of alcohol consumption on the incidence and course of HIV/AIDS is taken into account, with alcohol being responsible, in 2012, for 6.4% of all deaths and 4.7% of all DALYs lost in the African region. Alcohol exposure is expected to increase in the next years, and thus alcohol-attributable fractions.--NEW SECTION--The weight of new evidence, especially of alcohol's role in the incidence and course of HIV/AIDS, is particularly relevant to African countries and points to the need for a strong policy response to reduce the alcohol-related burden of disease on the continent.",eng,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26447995,10.1097/MD.0000000000001382,Leukocyte Activation in Obese Patients: Effect of Bariatric Surgery.,"The rising prevalence of obesity is a major global health problem. In severe obesity, bariatric surgery (BS) allows to obtain a significant weight loss and comorbidities improvement, among them one of the factors is the thrombotic risk. In this observational study, we measured indices of leukocyte activation in severely obese patients as markers of increased thrombotic risk in relation with serum markers of inflammation before and after BS. Frequency of polymorphonuclear neutrophil-platelet (PLT) and monocyte (MONO)-PLT aggregates as well as of tissue factor (TF) expressing MONOs was measured in the peripheral blood of 58 consecutive obese patients and 30 healthy controls. In 31 of the 58 obese patients, data obtained at the enrollment were compared with those obtained at 3, 6, and 12 months after BS. Compared with healthy controls, obese patients showed a higher frequency of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL)-PLT aggregates (7.47 ± 2.45 [6.82-8.11]% vs 5.85 ± 1.89 [5.14-6.55]%, P = 0.001), MONO-PLT aggregates (12.31 ± 7.33 [10.38-14.24]% vs 8.14 ± 2.22 [7.31-8.97]%, P < 0.001), and TF expressing MONOs (4.01 ± 2.11 [3.45-4.56]% vs 2.64 ± 1.65 [2.02-3.25]%, P = 0.002). PMNL-PLT and MONO-PLT aggregate frequency was positively correlated with TF expressing MONOs (R2 = 0.260, P = 0.049 and R2 = 0.318, P = 0.015, respectively). BS was performed in 31 patients and induced a significant reduction of the body mass index, and waist and hip circumferences. These effects were associated with a significant decrease of PMNL-PLT aggregates at 12 months (7.58 ± 2.27 [6.75-8.42]% vs 4.47 ± 1.11 [3.93-5.01]%, P < 0.001), and a reduction of TF expressing MONOs at 6 (3.82 ± 2.04 [3.07-4.57]% vs 1.60 ± 1.69 [0.30-2.90]%, P = 0.008) and 12 months (3.82 ± 2.04 [3.07-4.57]% vs 1.71 ± 0.54 [1.45-1.97]%, P = 0.001) after BS.These data suggest that leukocyte-PLT aggregate formation and MONO activation represent an important mechanism underlying the increased thrombotic risk of obese patients. We also show that BS is effective in normalizing these inflammatory indices.",eng,Medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26447004,10.11124/jbisrir-2015-1694,Student and educator experiences of maternal-child simulation-based learning: a systematic review of qualitative evidence protocol.,"The overall aim of this systematic review is to identify the appropriateness and meaningfulness of maternal-child simulation-based learning for undergraduate or pre-registration nursing students in educational settings to inform curriculum decision-making.1. What are the experiences of nursing or health professional students participating in undergraduate or pre-licensure maternal-child simulation-based learning in educational settings?2. What are the experiences of educators participating in undergraduate or pre-licensure maternal-child simulation-based learning in educational settings?3. What teaching and learning practices in maternal-child simulation-based learning are considered appropriate and meaningful by students and educators?--NEW SECTION--Maternal-child care is one of the pillars of primary health care. Health promotion and illness/ injury prevention begin in the preconception period and continue through pregnancy, birth, the postpartum period and the childrearing years. Thus, lifelong wellness is promoted across the continuum of perinatal and pediatric care which influences family health and early child development. Registered nurses (RNs) are expected to have the knowledge and skills needed to provide evidence-based nursing with childbearing and child-rearing families to promote health and address health inequities in many settings, including inner city, rural, northern, indigenous and global communities. The Canadian Maternity Experiences survey and the Report by the Advisor on Healthy Children and Youth provide information on current shortages of perinatal and child health care providers and stress the importance of the role of nurses as providers of rural and remote care. From a global health perspective, continued concern with both perinatal and child health morbidities and mortalities highlight the importance of maintaining and strengthening the presence of maternal and child health learning opportunities within undergraduate nursing curriculum.Despite this importance, educators in many countries have acknowledged difficulties providing nursing students with maternal-child hospital learning experiencesdue to declining birth rates, women's changing expectations about childbirth (i.e. birth as an intimate experience), increased outpatient and community management of early childhood health conditions, and increased competition for clinical placements. Canadian nurse educators and practice leaders have also identified gaps in recent RN graduates' readiness to provide safe, competent and evidence-based care for childbearing and child-rearing families. Newly graduated RNs working in acute care hospitals and in rural/remote community practice settings report feeling unprepared for providing maternity, neonatal and early childhood care.Recent concerns about the clinical reasoning skills of new graduates and the link to poor patient outcomes (e.g. not recognizing deteriorating patients) have led to calls to reform nursing education. In the Carnegie report, Benner, Sutphen, Leonard and Day identified four essential themes needed in the thinking and approach to nursing education, including: (1) a shift in focus from covering decontextualized knowledge to ""teaching for a sense of salience, situated cognition, and identifying action in particular clinical situations""; (2) better integration of classroom and clinical teaching; (3) more emphasis on clinical reasoning; and, (4) an emphasis on identity formation rather than socialization. Brown and Hartrick Doane propose that nurses need to draw on a range of knowledge that enhances the nurse's ""sensitivity and ability to be responsive in particular moments of practice"". Theoretical or decontextualized knowledge becomes a ""pragmatic tool"" used to improve nursing practice. Simulation has been identified as a promising pragmatic educational tool for practice learning that can be integrated with theoretical knowledge from nursing and other disciplines.Bland, Topping and Wood conducted a concept analysis and defined simulation in nursing education as:They also proposed that ""simulated learning is a dynamic concept that deserves empirical evaluation not merely to determine its effects but to uncover its full potential as a learning strategy"".Simulation usually involves student(s) providing nursing care to a simulated patient who might be a manikin or actor based on a standardized scenario. Following the experiential learning opportunity the scenario is debriefed and the clinical situation analyzed with opportunities for reflection on performance. In nursing education, simulation is usually used in a way that complements learning in practice settings. However simulation has also been used: to make up some clinical practice hours, to provide opportunities to practice and assess particular clinical skills, and for remedial learning when students encounter difficulties in practice settings. In addition simulation provides the opportunity to focus on quality and safety competencies (QSEN) that have been identified for nurses. New forms of simulation are being developed with multiple patients so that nursing students can learn to prioritize care needs and delegate care to other team members.Nurse educators have identified several advantages for learners using simulation, including: providing a safe environment to improve nursing competence, allowing learners to become more comfortable with receiving feedback about their clinical performance, providing consistent and comparable experiences for all students, and learning a mix of technical and non-technical skills including communication, teamwork and delegation. Within the Canadian context, students and instructors have reported positive learning experiences with simulation, particularly in understanding complex patient care scenarios, multidisciplinary team scenarios, team-based learning, and reflective debriefing. Furthermore, simulation technology has been proposed as a strategy for developing clinical reasoning skills, enhancing nurses' abilities to build upon previous knowledge and past experiences, and manage new or unfamiliar situations.Simulation has previously been integrated into nursing curricula in a ""piecemeal"" fashion that lacks an integrative pedagogy or theoretical approach. More recently a number of theoretical and pedagogical frameworks and best practice standards have been published. In April 2014 a preliminary search of literature (in CINAHL, Medline, Academic Search Complete and Web of Science) was conducted with guidance from our library specialist to test the search strategy and ensure that there would be enough qualitative findings to include in the systematic review. A preliminary scan of the abstracts from these searches demonstrated that many experiential case reports with qualitative findings were missed with the use of research limiters (including our search strategy specifically constructed to retrieve qualitative research) so the decision was made to err on the side of caution by searching more broadly and review a larger number of abstracts for inclusion in the study. However, a number of reports with qualitative findings were identified. For example, from a review of the abstracts from a CINAHL search dated April 17, qualitative research papers (including two dissertations), 12 evaluation study reports, six mixed methods studies and nine case reports with qualitative findings were identified. It is timely then to review qualitative studies to better understand the meaningfulness and appropriateness of integrating maternal-child simulation-based learning activities in undergraduate nursing education programs.A search of both the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews and the Joanna Briggs Institute Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports has been conducted. No systematic reviews of qualitative studies of maternal-child simulation-based learning for undergraduate or pre-registration nursing students in educational settings are evident in the literature. Although a systematic review of the meaningfulness and appropriateness of using human patient simulation manikins as a teaching and learning strategy in undergraduate nursing education had been planned and a protocol registered in October 2009, we learned from contacting the lead author that this systematic review was not completed. Currently little is known about how nursing students and/or educators have experienced maternal-child simulation or their understandings of the appropriateness and meaningfulness of particular simulation-based learning practices. Our proposed systematic review therefore fulfills all requirements for the PROSPERO database.--NEW SECTION--For this review we will use the definition of ""simulation-based learning experience"" adopted by the International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning (INACSL):We will include any use of simulation in an educational setting (with pre-registration or pre-licensure or undergraduate nursing or health professional students) with a focus relevant for maternal-child nursing.Maternal-child nursing has been variously defined in literature to include maternity care and pediatric nursing. For the purposes of this review, we will include perinatal, neonatal and pediatric contexts of care that focus on families with children under the age of five. We will exclude studies that focus on school age children, adolescents and/or youth.We have adapted an earlier definition of ""appropriateness"" as the ""best conditions under which simulation can be integrated into undergraduate nursing education"". In this review ""meaningfulness"" refers to the experiences and reflections of undergraduate nursing or health professional students and educators as presented in the studies reviewed.",eng,JBI database of systematic reviews and implementation reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Ebola virus disease can only be diagnosed in biosafety level 3 and 4 laboratories, which provide the security required to avoid exposure of both the staff and the environment to the pathogen. These laboratories are often far from the site of outbreaks, which may occur in rural areas or border regions (when the disease is imported from a neighboring country). Rapidly deployable laboratory units can bring the diagnosis closer to the outbreak site and thus significantly shorten the time to delivery of results, thus facilitating epidemic containment. Here we report our experience from the first months of implementation in Mali of a mobile laboratory unit of the same type as the European mobile labs and we describe the workflow in the laboratory as well as the training of its Malian staff. Based on our experience and the reports of other projects, we propose a framework in which these mobile laboratory units can strengthen epidemiological surveillance and contribute to containing outbreaks of emerging diseases in sub-Saharan Africa.",fre,Medecine et sante tropicales,English Abstract,2025-04-23,2015

It is already known that lifestyle-related disorders and the use of antipsychotics are closely related with the progression of atherosclerosis in psychiatric patients. Stroke as well as coronary heart disease play an important role in the cause of death in Asia and Japan. Thus, we studied the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in psychiatric inpatients in Japan using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).--NEW SECTION--This cross-sectional study was performed from January 2012 to December 2013. Study participants were 152 hospitalized patients (61 men and 91 women) in the Department of Psychiatry at Kohnodai Hospital, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Ichikawa City, Japan. Mean ages were 50.0 and 57.1 years old for men and women, respectively. The diagnoses (DSM-IV-TR criteria) of participants were schizophrenia (69.1%), mood disorder (18.4%), and other mental disorders (12.5%). We checked physical status, metabolic status of glucose and lipid levels, and brain MRI within 1 week of admission.--NEW SECTION--The study group showed a significantly high prevalence of diabetes and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterolemia in both sexes (n = 61 in men, n = 91 in women, P < .05). In the study group, serum fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were significantly high (n = 152, P < .05), but serum HDL cholesterol and total cholesterol were significantly low in both sexes (n = 61 in men, n = 90 in women, P < .05), and triglycerides were low in men (n = 61, P < .05).

Building on this progress and drawing from a tradition of Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG)'s successful work model, we would like to propose a new initiative - ""Global Health Epidemiology Reference Group"" (GHERG). We see GHERG as an informal and entirely voluntary international collaboration of academic groups who are willing to contribute to improving disease burden estimates and respect the principles of the new guidelines - a form of ""academic crowd-sourcing"". The main focus of GHERG will be to identify the ""gap areas"" where not much information is available and/or where there is a lot of uncertainty present about the accuracy of the existing estimates.

The REcognise Asthma and LInk to Symptoms and Experience Asia study assessed patients' perception of asthma control and attitudes toward treatment in an accessible, real-life adult Asian population.--NEW SECTION--An online survey of 2,467 patients with asthma from eight Asian countries/regions, aged 18-50 years, showed greater than or equal to two prescriptions in previous 2 years and access to social media. Patients were asked about their asthma symptoms, exacerbations and treatment type, views and perceptions of asthma control, attitudes toward asthma management, and sources of asthma information.--NEW SECTION--Patients had a mean age of 34.2 (±7.4) years and were diagnosed with asthma for 12.5 (±9.7) years. Half had the Global Initiative for Asthma-defined uncontrolled asthma. During the previous year, 38% of patients visited the emergency department, 33% were hospitalized, and 73% had greater than or equal to one course of oral corticosteroids. About 90% of patients felt that their asthma was under control, 82% considered their condition as not serious, and 59% were concerned about their condition. In all, 66% of patients viewed asthma control as managing attacks and 24% saw it as an absence of or minimal symptoms. About 14% of patients who correctly identified their controller inhalers had controlled asthma compared to 6% who could not.--NEW SECTION--Patients consistently overestimated their level of asthma control contrary to what their symptoms suggest. They perceived control as management of exacerbations, reflective of a crisis-oriented mind-set. Interventions can leverage on patients' trust in health care providers and desire for self-management via a new language to generate a paradigm shift toward symptom control and preventive care.",eng,Journal of asthma and allergy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Recognition of the epidemiologic circumstances involved in zoonotic spillover, amplification, and spread of diseases is essential for prioritizing surveillance and predicting future disease emergence risk. We examine the animal hosts and transmission mechanisms involved in spillover of zoonotic viruses to date, and discover that viruses with high host plasticity (i.e. taxonomically and ecologically diverse host range) were more likely to amplify viral spillover by secondary human-to-human transmission and have broader geographic spread. Viruses transmitted to humans during practices that facilitate mixing of diverse animal species had significantly higher host plasticity. Our findings suggest that animal-to-human spillover of new viruses that are capable of infecting diverse host species signal emerging disease events with higher pandemic potential in that these viruses are more likely to amplify by human-to-human transmission with spread on a global scale.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Unfortunately, widespread use, whether regarded as prudent or not, has favored the emergence and persistence of antibiotic resistant strains of human pathogenic bacteria, resulting in a global health threat. Bacteriophages (phages) are parasites that invade the cells of virtually all known bacteria. Phages reproduce by utilizing the host cell's machinery to replicate viral proteins and genomic material, generally damaging and killing the cell in the process. Thus, phage can be exploited therapeutically as bacteriolytic agents against bacteria. Furthermore, understanding of the molecular processes involved in the viral life cycle, particularly the entry and cell lysis steps, has led to the development of viral proteins as antibacterial agents. Here we review the current preclinical state of using phage-derived endolysins, virion-associated peptidoglycan hydrolases, polysaccharide depolymerases, and holins for the treatment of bacterial infection.

Despite the huge rise in recognition of malaria as a global health problem and the concurrent rise in funding over the past 10-15 years, malaria continues to remain a widespread burden. The evidence of increasing resistance to anti-malarial drugs and insecticides is a growing concern. Hence, an efficacious and durable preventative vaccine for malaria is urgently needed. Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective tools and have successfully been used in the prevention and control of many diseases, however, the development of a vaccine for the Plasmodium parasite has proved difficult. Given the early success of whole sporozoite mosquito-bite delivered vaccination strategies, we know that a vaccine for malaria is an achievable goal, with sub-unit vaccines holding great promise as they are simple and cheap to both manufacture and deploy. However a major difficulty in development of sub-unit vaccines lies within choosing the appropriate antigenic target from the 5000 or so genes expressed by the parasite. Given the liver-stage of malaria represents a bottle-neck in the parasite's life cycle, there is widespread agreement that a multi-component sub-unit malaria vaccine should preferably contain a liver-stage target. In this article we review progress in identifying and screening Plasmodium falciparum liver-stage targets for use in a malaria vaccine.",eng,Frontiers in microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Prior work has demonstrated clear impacts of stress upon basic cognitive function: biasing attention toward unexpected and potentially threatening information and instantiating a negative affective bias. However, the impact that these changes have on higher-order, executive, decision-making processes is unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of a translational within-subjects stress induction (threat of unpredictable shock) on two well-established executive decision-making biases: the framing effect (N = 83), and temporal discounting (N = 36). In both studies, we demonstrate (a) clear subjective effects of stress, and (b) clear executive decision-making biases but (c) no impact of stress on these decision-making biases. Indeed, Bayes factor analyses confirmed substantial preference for decision-making models that did not include stress. We posit that while stress may induce subjective mood change and alter low-level perceptual and action processes (Robinson et al., 2013c), some higher-level executive processes remain unperturbed by these impacts. As such, although stress can induce a transient affective biases and altered mood, these need not result in poor financial decision-making.",eng,Frontiers in psychology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26438780,10.1093/heapol/czv070,Pneumonia's second wind? A case study of the global health network for childhood pneumonia.,"Advocacy, policy, research and intervention efforts against childhood pneumonia have lagged behind other health issues, including malaria, measles and tuberculosis. Accelerating progress on the issue began in 2008, following decades of efforts by individuals and organizations to address the leading cause of childhood mortality and establish a global health network. This article traces the history of this network's formation and evolution to identify lessons for other global health issues. Through document review and interviews with current, former and potential network members, this case study identifies five distinct eras of activity against childhood pneumonia: a period of isolation (post WWII to 1984), the duration of WHO's Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Programme (1984-1995), Integrated Management of Childhood illness's (IMCI) early years (1995-2003), a brief period of network re-emergence (2003-2008) and recent accelerating progress (2008 on). Analysis of these eras reveals the critical importance of building a shared identity in order to form an effective network and take advantage of emerging opportunities. During the ARI era, an initial network formed around a relatively narrow shared identity focused on community-level care. The shift to IMCI led to the partial dissolution of this network, stalled progress on addressing pneumonia in communities and missed opportunities. Frustrated with lack of progress on the issue, actors began forming a network and shared identity that included a broad spectrum of those whose interests overlap with pneumonia.

26438748,10.1377/hlthaff.2014.1456,Risk Selection Threatens Quality Of Care For Certain Patients: Lessons From Europe's Health Insurance Exchanges.,"Experience in European health insurance exchanges indicates that even with the best risk-adjustment formulas, insurers have substantial incentives to engage in risk selection. The potentially most worrisome form of risk selection is skimping on the quality of care for underpriced high-cost patients--that is, patients for whom insurers are compensated at a rate lower than the predicted health care expenses of these patients. In this article we draw lessons for the United States from twenty years of experience with health insurance exchanges in Europe, where risk selection is a serious problem. Mistakes by European legislators and inadequate evaluation criteria for risk selection incentives are discussed, as well as strategies to reduce risk selection and the complex trade-off among selection (through quality skimping), efficiency, and affordability. Recommended improvements to the risk-adjustment process in the United States include considering the adoption of risk adjusters used in Europe, investing in the collection of data, using a permanent form of risk sharing, and replacing the current premium ""band"" restrictions with more flexible restrictions. Policy makers need to understand the complexities of regulating competitive health insurance markets and to prevent risk selection that threatens the provision of good-quality care for underpriced high-cost patients.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26438747,10.1377/hlthaff.2014.1453,Assessing Latin America's Progress Toward Achieving Universal Health Coverage.,"Two commonly used metrics for assessing progress toward universal health coverage involve assessing citizens' rights to health care and counting the number of people who are in a financial protection scheme that safeguards them from high health care payments. On these metrics most countries in Latin America have already ""reached"" universal health coverage. Neither metric indicates, however, whether a country has achieved universal health coverage in the now commonly accepted sense of the term: that everyone--irrespective of their ability to pay--gets the health services they need without suffering undue financial hardship. We operationalized a framework proposed by the World Bank and the World Health Organization to monitor progress under this definition and then constructed an overall index of universal health coverage achievement. We applied the approach using data from 112 household surveys from 1990 to 2013 for all twenty Latin American countries. No country has achieved a perfect universal health coverage score, but some countries (including those with more integrated health systems) fare better than others. All countries except one improved in overall universal health coverage over the time period analyzed.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In Oman, it is the most common cancer in women, with an incidence rate of 15.6 per 100,000 Omani females. Various anticancer remedies have been discovered from natural products in the past and the search is continuing for additional examples. Cytotoxic natural compounds may have a major role in cancer therapy either in potentiating the effect of chemotherapy or reducing its harmful effects. Recently, a few studies have reported advantages of using crude camel milk in treating some forms of cancer. However, no adequate data are available on the lyophilised camel's milk responsibility for triggering apoptosis and oxidative stress associated with human breast cancer. The present study aimed to address the role of the lyophilised camel's milk in inducing proliferation repression of BT-474 and HEp-2 cells compared with the non-cancer HCC1937 BL cell line. Lyophilized camel's milk fundamentally repressed BT-474 cells growth and proliferation through the initiation of either the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways as indicated by both caspase-3 mRNA and its action level, and induction of death receptors in BT-474 but not the HEp-2 cell line. In addition, lyophilised camel's milk enhanced the expression of oxidative stress markers, heme-oxygenase-1 and reactive oxygen species production in BT-474 cells. Increase in caspase-3 mRNA levels by the lyophilised camel's milk was completely prevented by the actinomycin D, a transcriptional inhibitor. This suggests that lyophilized camel's milk increased newly synthesized RNA. Interestingly,it significantly (p<0.003) repressed the growth of HEp-2 cells and BT-474 cells after treatment for 72 hours while 24 hours treatment repressed BT-474 cells alone. This finding suggests that the lyophilised camel's milk might instigate apoptosis through initiation of an alternative apoptotic pathway.",eng,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

There are tens of thousands of chemicals in global commerce, and even small exposures to toxic chemicals during pregnancy can trigger adverse health consequences. Exposure to toxic environmental chemicals and related health outcomes are inequitably distributed within and between countries; universally, the consequences of exposure are disproportionately borne by people with low incomes. Discrimination, other social factors, economic factors, and occupation impact risk of exposure and harm. Documented links between prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals and adverse health outcomes span the life course and include impacts on fertility and pregnancy, neurodevelopment, and cancer.

Although reperfusion therapy is the treatment to increase blood supply to the ischemic myocardium, this intervention potentially causes cardiac tissue damage and instigates arrhythmias, processes known as reperfusion injury. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are glycemic control drugs commonly used in T2DM patients. Growing evidence from basic and clinical studies demonstrates that a DPP-4 inhibitor could exert cardioprotection and improve left ventricular function by reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and increasing reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) activity. However, recent reports also showed potentially adverse cardiac events due to the use of a DPP-4 inhibitor. To investigate this disparity, future large clinical trials are essential in verifying whether DPP-4 inhibitors are beneficial beyond their glycemic control particularly for the ischemic heart in obese-insulin resistant subjects and T2DM patients.",eng,International journal of cardiology,Letter,2025-04-23,2016

Conventional influenza therapy is directed against the viral neuraminidase protein, which promotes virus release from infected cells, and the viral ion channel M2, which facilitates viral uncoating. However, these drugs, albeit effective, have a major drawback: their targets are of a highly variable sequence. As a consequence, the virus can readily acquire resistance by mutating the drug targets. Indeed, most seasonal A/H1N1 viruses and the 2009 H1N1 virus are resistant to M2 inhibitors, and a significant proportion of the seasonal A/H1N1 viruses are resistant to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir. Development of new effective drugs for treatment of disease during the regular influenza seasons and the possible influenza pandemic represents an important goal. The results presented here point out natural products as a promising source of low toxic and widely accessible drug candidates for treatment of the influenza disease. Natural products combined with new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing techniques, which accelerate development of new drugs, serve as an important platform for development of new influenza therapeutics.",eng,Current pharmaceutical design,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

HPV also causes anal, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and oropharyngeal cancer. Prophylactic HPV vaccines based on recombinantly expressed virus-like particles have been developed. Two first-generation, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines prevent infections and disease caused by HPV16 and HPV18, the two HPV genotypes that cause approximately 70% of cervical cancer, and one of these vaccines also prevents HPV6 and HPV11, the two HPV genotypes that cause 90% of genital warts. A next-generation vaccine, recently approved by the U.S. FDA, targets HPV16, HPV18, and five additional HPV genotypes that together causes approximately 90% of cervical cancer as well as HPV6 and HPV11. In clinical trials, these vaccines have shown high levels of efficacy against disease and infections caused by the targeted HPV genotypes in adolescent females and males and older females. Data indicate population effectiveness, and therefore cost effectiveness, is highest in HPV-naive young females prior to becoming sexually active. Countries that implemented HPV vaccination before 2010 have already experienced decreases in population prevalence of targeted HPV genotypes and related anogenital diseases in women and via herd protection in heterosexual men. Importantly, after more than 100 million doses given worldwide, HPV vaccination has demonstrated an excellent safety profile. With demonstrated efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and safety, universal HPV vaccination of all young, adolescent women, and with available resources at least high-risk groups of men, should be a global health priority.

Exposure to pollutants at the work place, i.e. occupational exposure, is one of the areas that need immediate attention. The civic drainage workers are exposed to pollutants present in the wastewater they handle and most of them are toxic heavy metals. Exposure to such pollutants may be a health hazard, since it can lead to the imbalance in nutrient elements status.--NEW SECTION--In the present study, profiling of trace elements in the blood of drainage worker population from an Indian megacity, Kolkata, was carried out by energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) and compared with the control group population of the same area.--NEW SECTION--The elements detected by EDXRF spectrometry include P, S, Cl, K, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se, Br, and Rb. By using ANOVA with 5% significance level, we observed significant alterations in the trace elements status, iron over loading, selenium deficiency, and in Cu-Zn ratio. Gender specific variations within the same population were also observed.--NEW SECTION--The results indicate that the drainage workers have altered elemental profile in comparison to that of control population. Significance for public healthEnvironmental pollution is a global health risk and awareness among sewage workers is growing very slowly in many developing countries. Due to this fact, workers are often exposed to different pollutants which are responsible for several health complications. Imbalances in the presence of trace elements in blood are a symptom of different health status and could also indicate new health perspectives for the future. In the present scenario, this paper is essential since this kind of analysis has not been done yet, especially regarding the health status of sewage workers. We hope this initial study will be a starting point for future investigations.",eng,Journal of public health research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The Edmonton obesity staging system clearly pointed towards increased mortality proportionate to the severity of obesity. Obesity itself triggers insulin resistance and thereby poses the risk of T2DM. Both obesity and T2DM have been associated with higher morbidity and mortality and this calls for institution of effective therapies to deal with the rising trend of complications arising out of this dual menace. Although lifestyle changes form the cornerstone of therapy for both the ailments, sustained results from this modalities is far from satisfactory. While Look AHEAD (action for HEAalth in diabetes) study showed significant weight loss, reduction in glycated hemoglobin and higher remission rate of T2DM at 1(st) year following intensive lifestyle measures; recurrence and relapse rate bounced back in half of subjects at 4 years, thereby indicating that weight loss and glycemic control is difficult to maintain in the long term with lifestyle interventions. Same recurrence phenomenon was also observed with pharmacotherapy with rimonabant, sibutramine and orlistat. Bariatric surgery has been seen to associate with substantial and sustained weight loss in morbidly obese patients. Interestingly, bariatric surgeries also induce higher rates of short and long-term diabetes remission. Although the exact mechanism behinds this diabetes remission are not well understood; improved insulin action, beta-cell function and complex interplay of hormones in the entero-insular axis appears to play a major role. This article reviews the effectiveness of bariatric procedures on remission or improvement in diabetes and put a perspective on its implicated mechanisms.",eng,Indian journal of endocrinology and metabolism,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26423953,10.1128/JVI.01531-15,Breakthrough Virus Neutralization Resistance as a Correlate of Protection in a Nonhuman Primate Heterologous Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Vaccine Challenge Study.,"Comprehensive assessments of immune correlates of protection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine trials are essential to vaccine design. Neutralization sieve analysis compares the neutralization sensitivity of the breakthrough transmitted/founder (TF) viruses from vaccinated and control animals to infer the molecular mechanisms of vaccine protection. Here, we report a robust neutralization sieve effect in a nonhuman primate simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine trial (DNA prime/recombinant adenovirus type 5 [rAd5] boost) (VRC-10-332) that demonstrated substantial protective efficacy and revealed a genetic signature of neutralization resistance in the C1 region of env. We found significant enrichment for neutralization resistance in the vaccine compared to control breakthrough TF viruses when tested with plasma from vaccinated study animals, plasma from chronically SIV-infected animals, and a panel of SIV-specific monoclonal antibodies targeting six discrete Env epitopes (P < 0.008 for all comparisons). Neutralization resistance was significantly associated with the previously identified genetic signature of resistance (P < 0.0001), and together, the results identify virus neutralization as a correlate of protection. These findings further demonstrate the in vivo relevance of our previous in vitro analyses of the SIVsmE660 challenge stock, which revealed a broad range of neutralization sensitivities of its component viruses. In sum, this report demonstrates proof-of-concept that phenotypic sieve analyses can elucidate mechanistic correlates of immune protection following vaccination and raises a cautionary note for SIV and SHIV (simian-human immunodeficiency virus) vaccine studies that employ challenge strains with envelope glycoproteins that fail to exhibit neutralization resistance profiles typical of TF viruses.--NEW SECTION--With more than 2 million new infections annually, the development of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is a global health priority. Understanding immunologic correlates of protection generated in vaccine trials is critical to advance vaccine development. Here, we assessed the role of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies in a recent nonhuman primate study of a vaccine that showed significant protection against simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) challenge and suggested a genetic signature of neutralization sensitivity. We found that breakthrough viruses able to establish infection in vaccinated animals were substantially more resistant to antibody-mediated neutralization than were viruses from controls. These findings suggest that vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies selectively blocked the transmission of more sensitive challenge viruses. Sieve analysis also corroborated a genetic signature of neutralization sensitivity and highlighted the impact of challenge swarm diversity. Our findings suggest an important role for neutralization sieve analyses as an informative component of comprehensive immune-correlates analyses.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26423946,10.1128/JVI.01365-15,Flavivirus Infection Impairs Peroxisome Biogenesis and Early Antiviral Signaling.,"Flaviviruses are significant human pathogens that have an enormous impact on the global health burden. Currently, there are very few vaccines against or therapeutic treatments for flaviviruses, and our understanding of how these viruses cause disease is limited. Evidence suggests that the capsid proteins of flaviviruses play critical nonstructural roles during infection, and therefore, elucidating how these viral proteins affect cellular signaling pathways could lead to novel targets for antiviral therapy. We used affinity purification to identify host cell proteins that interact with the capsid proteins of West Nile and dengue viruses. One of the cellular proteins that formed a stable complex with flavivirus capsid proteins is the peroxisome biogenesis factor Pex19. Intriguingly, flavivirus infection resulted in a significant loss of peroxisomes, an effect that may be due in part to capsid expression. We posited that capsid protein-mediated sequestration and/or degradation of Pex19 results in loss of peroxisomes, a situation that could result in reduced early antiviral signaling. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that induction of the lambda interferon mRNA in response to a viral RNA mimic was reduced by more than 80%. Together, our findings indicate that inhibition of peroxisome biogenesis may be a novel mechanism by which flaviviruses evade the innate immune system during early stages of infection.--NEW SECTION--RNA viruses infect hundreds of millions of people each year, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Chief among these pathogens are the flaviviruses, which include dengue virus and West Nile virus. Despite their medical importance, there are very few prophylactic or therapeutic treatments for these viruses. Moreover, the manner in which they subvert the innate immune response in order to establish infection in mammalian cells is not well understood. Recently, peroxisomes were reported to function in early antiviral signaling, but very little is known regarding if or how pathogenic viruses affect these organelles. We report for the first time that flavivirus infection results in significant loss of peroxisomes in mammalian cells, which may indicate that targeting of peroxisomes is a key strategy used by viruses to subvert early antiviral defenses.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Outcomes were HrQoL (SF-12), infection-related concerns, global health status, fatigue (FACIT), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and somatic symptoms (SSS-8).--NEW SECTION--Comparisons between groups (n1=42, n2=32, n3=12) yielded no significant differences in HrQoL, subjective risk of infection, and most other psychosocial variables. However, the Ebola patient treatment group experienced significantly higher levels of social isolation than both other groups. The best predictors of poor physical and mental HrQoL were perceived lack of knowledge about the Ebola virus disease (physical: B=-1.2, p=0.05; mental: B=-1.3, p=0.03) and fatigue (physical: B=-0.3, p=0.02; mental: B=-0.53, p<0.001).--NEW SECTION--Ebola patient treatment in tertiary care does not seem to be associated with lower HrQoL and enhanced subjective risk of infection, but seems to yield feelings of social isolation in health-care professionals.",eng,Journal of psychosomatic research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, because of challenges in rolling out the technology and weak quality assurance measures, the promise of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related POCT in resource-limited settings has not been fully exploited to improve patient care and impact public health. Because of these challenges, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), in partnership with other organizations, recently launched the Diagnostics Access Initiative. Expanding HIV programs, including the ""test and treat"" strategies and the newly established UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, will require increased access to reliable and accurate POCT results.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which affects up to 90% of obese people and nearly 70% of the overweight, is commonly associated with MetS characteristics such as obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidemia. In the present study, we demonstrate that hepatic lipase (HL)-inactivation in mice fed with a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet produced dyslipidemia including hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and increased non-esterified fatty acid levels. These changes were accompanied by glucose intolerance, pancreatic and hepatic inflammation and steatosis. In addition, compared with WT mice, HL(-/-) mice exhibited enhanced circulating MCP1 levels, monocytosis and higher percentage of CD4+Th17+ cells. Consistent with increased inflammation, livers from HL(-/-) mice had augmented activation of the stress SAPK/JNK- and p38-pathways compared with the activation levels of the kinases in livers from WT mice. Analysis of HL(-/-) and WT mice fed regular chow diet showed dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance in HL(-/-) mice without any other changes in inflammation or hepatic steatosis. Altogether, these results indicate that dyslipidemia induced by HL-deficiency in combination with a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet promotes hepatic steatosis and inflammation in mice which are, at least in part, mediated by the activation of the stress SAPK/JNK- and p38-pathways. Future studies are warranted to asses the viability of therapeutic strategies based on the modulation of these kinases to reduce hepatic steatosis associated to lipase dysfunction.",eng,The Journal of endocrinology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This study sought to explore self-compassion as a psychological resource in the self-stigma process.--NEW SECTION--In a 2012 representative German population survey of N = 1,158 overweight and obese individuals, self-compassion was examined as a mediator between self-stigma and mental and physical health outcomes, including BMI (kg/m2), using structural equation modeling and controlling for sociodemographic factors.--NEW SECTION--Psychological variables were assessed using validated self-report questionnaires. Self-compassion partially mediated the relationships between self-stigma and depression, somatic symptoms, and health status/quality of life, lowering the predictive effect of self-stigma on the outcomes by approximately one-third. In contrast, self-compassion, because it was unrelated to BMI, did not mediate the association between self-stigma and BMI.--NEW SECTION--Self-compassion has the potential to act as a buffer against the mental and global health detriments of self-stigma in overweight and obesity and could thus represent a target for interventions to reduce self-stigma and prevent these health impairments. In order to influence the association between self-stigma and BMI, self-compassion should conceptually be linked to weight management.",eng,Obesity facts,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The purpose of this study was to investigate if the proto-oncogene survivin might aid in treatment decisions in early rheumatoid arthritis.--NEW SECTION--Serum survivin levels were measured in 302 patients who completed the Swedish pharmacotherapy (SWEFOT) trial at baseline, 3, 12, and 24 months. Survivin levels > 0.45 ng/mL were considered positive. Based on the survivin status, core set outcomes measuring disease activity, functional disability, as well as global health and pain were evaluated after methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy at 3 months, and at 12 and 24 months of follow-up. Treatment of non-responders was randomly intensified with either a combination of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (triple therapy: MTX, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine) or by adding antibodies against tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF).--NEW SECTION--Antirheumatic treatment resulted in an overall decrease of serum survivin levels. Survivin-positive patients at baseline who initially responded to MTX had a higher risk of disease re-activation (OR 3.21 (95% CI 1.12-9.24), P = 0.032) and failed to improve in their functional disability (P = 0.018) if having continued on MTX monotherapy compared to survivin-negative patients. Ever-smokers who were survivin-positive were less likely to respond to MTX than those who were survivin-negative (OR 1.91 (1.01-3.62), P = 0.045). In survivin-positive patients, triple therapy led to better improvements in disease activity than did MTX + anti-TNF. At 24 months, survivin-positive patients randomized to anti-TNF had a higher risk of active disease than those randomized to triple therapy (OR 3.15 (1.09-9.10), P = 0.037).--NEW SECTION--We demonstrate for the first time that survivin is a valuable serologic marker that can distinguish drug-specific clinical responses in early rheumatoid arthritis through the pragmatic clinical setting of the care-based SWEFOT trial. Although treatment response cannot solely be attributable to survivin status, per protocol sensitivity analyses confirmed the superior effect of triple therapy on survivin-positive patients.--NEW SECTION--Survivin-positive patients have poor outcomes if treated with MTX monotherapy. A decrease of survivin levels during treatment is associated with better clinical responses. For survivin-positive patients who fail MTX, triple therapy is associated with better outcomes than anti-TNF therapy.--NEW SECTION--WHO database at the Karolinska University Hospital: CT20080004 ; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00764725, registered 1 October 2008.",eng,BMC medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Until 2013, Chikungunya infection had been largely restricted to East Africa and the Indian Ocean, with cases within the USA reported to be from foreign travel. However, in 2014, over 1 million suspected cases were reported in the Americas, and a recently infected human could serve as an unwitting reservoir for the virus resulting in an epidemic in the continental USA. Chikungunya infection is increasingly being associated with neurological sequelae. In this study, we sought to understand the role of astrocytes in the neuropathogenesis of Chikungunya infection. Even after virus has been cleared form the circulation, astrocytes were activated with regard to TLR2 expression. In addition, white matter astrocytes were hypertrophic, with increased arbor volume in gray matter astrocytes. Combined, these would alter the number and distribution of synapses that each astrocyte would be capable of forming. These results provide the first evidence that Chikungunya infection induces morphometric and innate immune activation of astrocytes in vivo.

Two hundred and twenty two patients with CRC were included. The sociodemographic form and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) were used.--NEW SECTION--The study group consisted of 142 males (64%) and 80 females (36%). The mean patient age was 55.68±11.387 years. The majority of the patients (36.9%) had local disease while advanced-stage disease and locally advanced stage disease had 32.2% and 28.8% of the patients; respectively. The mean QoL score was moderate (62.81± 27.0). The most common complaints were fatigue, economic difficulties and constipation. Gender, education level and disease stage were associated with QoL. Physical, role and social functioning were more adversely affected in female patients. Compared to women, men had significantly more favorable global QoL (p=0.044). Some functional scales were worse in advanced disease compared to other stages.These outcomes were statistically significant in the functional scales of global health (p=0.007), physical (p=0.03), cognitive (p=0.01) and emotional function (p=0.007).

However, poorly resourced countries have thus far been constrained for three main reasons. First, the cost of whole genome sequencing is still considerably high in comparison to other (non-genomics) diagnostics in the developing world where both science and social dynamics create a dynamic and fragile healthcare ecosystem. Second, studies correlating genomic differences with drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have not been consistent, and more importantly, often not indexed to impact on societal end-points, beyond clinical practice. Third, ethics regulatory frames over PGx testing require improvements based on nested accountability systems and in ways that address the user community needs. Thus, CYP2B6 is a crucial enzyme in the metabolism of antiretroviral drugs, efavirenz and nevirapine. More than 40 genetic variants have been reported, but only a few contribute to differences in plasma EFV and NVP concentrations. The most widely reported CYP2B6 variants affecting plasma drug levels include c.516G>T, c.983T>C, and to a lesser extent, g.15582C>T, which should be considered in future PGx tests. While the first two variants are easily characterized, the g.15582C>T detection has been performed primarily by sequencing, which is costly, labor intensive, and requires access to barely available expertise in the developing world. We report here on a simple, practical PCR-RFLP method with vast potentials for use in resource-constrained world regions to detect the g.15582C>T variation among South African and Cameroonian persons. The effects of CYP2B6 g.15582C>T on plasma EFV concentration were further evaluated among HIV/AIDS patients. We report no differences in the frequency of the g.15582T variant between the South African (0.08) and Cameroonian (0.06) groups, which are significantly lower than reported in Asians (0.39) and Caucasians (0.31). The g.15582C/T and T/T genotypes were associated with significantly reduced EFV levels (p=0.006). This article additionally presents the policy relevance of the PGX global health diagnostics and therefore, collectively makes an original interdisciplinary contribution to the field of integrative biology and personalized medicine in developing world. Such studies are, in fact, broadly important because resource-constrained regions exist not only in developing world but also in major geographical parts of the G20 nations and the developed countries.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Although it is considered to be the gold standard form of diversion in many centers of expertise, however it is uncommonly performed outside these institutions. The purpose of this article is to review the current indications and outcomes of orthotopic diversion with a focus on male patients and to explore potential barriers to wider dissemination of the technique.--NEW SECTION--Approximately 75% of patients undergoing radical cystectomy today are candidates for orthotopic diversion and in the absence of absolute contraindications, very few patients chose to undergo an ileal conduit for personal reasons. In a recent quality of life study, the orthotopic neobladder was better than ileal conduit in terms of global health status and physical functioning. In a prospective randomized trial comparing a refluxing versus nonrefluxing neobladder, there was no difference in renal function after 3 years. There is currently insufficient evidence to suggest improved perioperative outcomes with the use of minimally invasive techniques.--NEW SECTION--There are very few absolute contraindications for an orthotopic neobladder, which remains the gold standard form of diversion at many centers of expertise.

These changes affect nearly all patients and must be reviewed in detail as part of the preoperative consultation. However, quantifying a patient's risk for altered HRQoL is imprecise, thus complicating the choice for urinary diversion.--NEW SECTION--A recent prospective study observed improved global health status and physical, role, and social functioning in patients treated with orthotopic neobladder diversion compared with patients treated with ileal conduit diversion. In contrast, robotic-assisted radical cystectomy does not improve patient quality of life (QoL) over open radical cystectomy within the first year of surgery. Enhanced recovery protocols improve immediate postoperative QoL but their effect on long-term QoL is uncertain.--NEW SECTION--There is still a significant lack of understanding about the QoL between various types of urinary diversions. Recent and ongoing prospective randomized trials in the radical cystectomy population may shed light on urinary diversion-specific function and related effects on HRQoL.

High infection rates and problems associated with lifelong antiretroviral treatment emphasize the need for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic immune intervention strategies. It is conceivable that insights for the design of new immunogens capable of eliciting protective immune responses may come from the analysis of HIV-specific antibody responses in infected patients. Using sophisticated technologies, several monoclonal neutralizing antibodies were isolated from HIV-infected individuals. However, the majority of polyclonal antibody responses found in infected patients are nonneutralizing. Comprehensive analyses of the molecular targets of HIV-specific antibody responses identified that during natural infection antibodies are mainly misdirected towards gp120 epitopes outside of the CD4-binding site and against regions and proteins that are not exposed on the surface of the virus. We therefore argue that vaccines aiming to induce protective responses should include engineered immunogens, which are capable of focusing the immune response towards protective epitopes.",eng,International archives of allergy and immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The recent clinical licensing of direct-acting antivirals enables viral cure. However, limited access to therapy and treatment failure in patient subgroups warrants a continuing effort to develop complementary antiviral strategies. Furthermore, once fibrosis is established, curing HCV infection does not eliminate the risk for HCC. High-throughput approaches and screens have enabled the investigation of virus-host interactions on a genome-wide scale. Gain- and loss-of-function screens have identified essential host-dependency factors in the HCV viral life cycle, such as host cell entry factors or regulatory factors for viral replication and assembly. Network analyses of systems-scale data sets provided a comprehensive view of the cellular state following HCV infection, thus improving our understanding of the virus-induced responses of the target cell. Interactome, metabolomics and gene expression studies identified dysregulated cellular processes potentially contributing to HCV pathogenesis and HCC. Drug screens using chemical libraries led to the discovery of novel antivirals.

Recently, a number of potent direct acting antiviral drugs have been developed targeting specific processes in the viral life cycle. Here, we developed a mathematical multi-scale model of the within-host dynamics of HCV infection by integrating a standard model for viral infection with a detailed model of the viral replication cycle inside infected cells. We use this model to study patient time courses of viral load under treatment with daclatasvir, an inhibitor of the viral non-structural protein NS5A. Model analysis predicts that treatment efficacy can be increased by combining daclatasvir with dedicated viral polymerase inhibitors, corresponding to promising current strategies in drug development.

In recent years, diseases associated with inflammation and septicemia have already become a global health issue. Therefore, there is a rising demand for the development of novel ""super"" antibiotics. In this context, antimicrobial peptides offer an attractive, alternate therapeutic solution to conventional antibiotics.--NEW SECTION--Microbroth dilution assay was performed to investigate the antimicrobial activities of the two designed peptides against Gram negative bacterial pathogens. Fluorescence studies including NPN dye uptake assay, Calcein entrapped vesicle leakage assay, quenching and anisotropy in presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were performed to elucidate binding interactions and enhanced membrane permeabilisation. Hemolytic assay and endotoxin/LPS neutralisation assay were performed to study the hemolytic effects and LPS scavenging abilities of the peptides. High resolution NMR studies were performed to obtain insights into LPS-peptide interaction at the molecular level.--NEW SECTION--Here, we report more potent analogues of previously designed peptide VG16KRKP, designed through dimerization via Cys-Cys disulphide linkage and N-terminal lipidation. Similar to the parent peptide, VG16KRKP, the modified analogue peptides are non hemolytic in nature, but possessed, 2-10-fold increase in antibacterial activities against E. coli, human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the devastating plant pathogen, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris as well as membrane permeabilization, and endotoxin neutralization. LPS bound solution structure of both analogues, as determined by NMR spectroscopy, reveal that the conserved hydrophobic triad motif, formed by Trp5, Leu11 and Phe12 is compactly organized and stabilized either by the acyl chain or disulphide bond. This structural constraint accounts for the separation of polar face from the hydrophobic face of the peptides.

26405157,10.1093/heapol/czv092,Network advocacy and the emergence of global attention to newborn survival.,"Globally 2.9 million babies die each year before reaching 28 days of life. Over the past quarter century, neonatal mortality has declined at a slower pace than post-neonatal under-five mortality: in consequence newborns now comprise 44% of all deaths to children under five years. Despite high numbers of newborn deaths, global organizations and national governments paid little attention to the issue until 2000, and resources, while growing since then, remain inadequate. This study examines the factors behind these patterns of policy attention: the delayed emergence of attention, its sudden appearance in 2000, its growth thereafter, but the dearth of resources to date. Drawing on a framework on global health networks grounded in collective action theory, the study finds that a newborn survival network helped to shift perceptions about the problem's severity and tractability, contributing to the rise of global attention. Its efforts were facilitated by pressure on governments to achieve the child survival Millennium Development Goal and by growing awareness that the neonatal period constituted a growing percentage of under-five mortality, a fact the network publicized. The network's relatively recent emergence, its predominantly technical rather than political composition and strategies, and its inability to date to find a framing of the issue that has convinced national political leaders of the issue's urgency, in part explain the insufficiency of resources. However, since 2010 a number of non-health oriented inter-governmental organizations have begun to pay attention to the issue, and several countries with high neonatal mortality have created national plans, developments which augur well for the future. The study points to two broader implications concerning how neglected global health issues come to attract attention: priority emerges from a confluence of factors, rather than any single cause; and growth in priority may depend on the creation of a broader political coalition that extends beyond the largely technically oriented actors who may first press for attention to a problem.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

I show that the encounter between the feasible and the fantastic in the realm of public health generates feelings of absurdity and futility among medical professionals, characteristic of disease control in the precarious present. Precarity is neither a social and economic condition per se, nor is the link between disease and precarity static. It is a dynamic process of political inclusions, exclusions, and inequalities, which differ substantially within the unequal spheres of precarious lives. The contradictions in tuberculosis control that I describe are thus not only characteristic of French public health but of global public health today, where illusions in disease control encounter the exclusionary realities of social life.",eng,Medical anthropology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Individuals with tuberculosis disease commonly exhibit vitamin D deficiency, which may adversely affect immunity and the response to therapy.--NEW SECTION--We determined whether adjunctive high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation improves outcomes in individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis disease.--NEW SECTION--The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, intent-to-treat trial in 199 individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis disease in Tbilisi, Georgia. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive oral vitamin D3 [50,000 IUs (1.25 mg) thrice weekly for 8 wk and 50,000 IU every other week for 8 wk] or a placebo concomitant with standard first-line antituberculosis drugs. The primary outcome was the time for the conversion of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) sputum culture to negative.--NEW SECTION--Baseline characteristics between groups were similar. Most subjects (74%) were vitamin D deficient (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration <50 nmol/L). With vitamin D3, plasma 25(OH)D concentrations peaked at ∼250 nmol/L by 8 wk and decreased to ∼125 nmol/L at week 16. Adverse events and plasma calcium concentrations were similar between groups. In 192 subjects with culture-confirmed tuberculosis, an adjusted efficacy analysis showed similar median culture-conversion times between vitamin D3 and placebo groups [29 and 27 d, respectively; HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.18; P = 0.33). Eight-week culture-conversion rates were also similar (84.0% and 82.1% for vitamin D3 and placebo, respectively; P = 0.99).--NEW SECTION--A high-dose vitamin D3 regimen safely corrected vitamin D deficiency but did not improve the rate of sputum Mtb clearance over 16 wk in this pulmonary tuberculosis cohort.

26398581,10.1002/jps.24650,Elemental Impurities in Pharmaceutical Excipients.,"Control of elemental impurities in pharmaceutical materials is currently undergoing a transition from control based on concentrations in components of drug products to control based on permitted daily exposures in drug products. Within the pharmaceutical community, there is uncertainty regarding the impact of these changes on manufactures of drug products. This uncertainty is fueled in part by a lack of publically available information on elemental impurity levels in common pharmaceutical excipients. This paper summarizes a recent survey of elemental impurity levels in common pharmaceutical excipients as well as some drug substances. A widely applicable analytical procedure was developed and was shown to be suitable for analysis of elements that are subject to United States Pharmacopoeia Chapter <232> and International Conference on Harmonization's Q3D Guideline on Elemental Impurities. The procedure utilizes microwave-assisted digestion of pharmaceutical materials and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for quantitative analysis of these elements. The procedure was applied to 190 samples from 31 different excipients and 15 samples from eight drug substances provided through the International Pharmaceutical Excipient Council of the Americas. The results of the survey indicate that, for the materials included in the study, relatively low levels of elemental impurities are present.",eng,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, a corresponding increase in reporting of research from these settings has not been observed. This article critically explores the importance of promoting and reporting of health research from resource-poor settings, current trends, and practices, and discusses the key challenges faced by researchers from such settings. These challenges include changing face of open-access (OA) and online publishing, the threat of predatory OA journals, authorship and international partnership ethics, attitudinal problems hindering research reporting, and a lack of alternative publishing spaces.

Here, we describe a highly effective component vaccine against S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in both gastroenteritis and systemic murine infection models. We devised an approach to generate supernatants of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, an organism that is highly abundant in virulence factors. Immunization of mice with this supernatant resulted in dramatic protection against a challenge with serovar Typhimurium, showing increased survival in the systemic model and decreased intestinal pathology in the gastrointestinal model. Protection correlated with specific IgA and IgG levels in the serum and specific secretory IgA levels in the feces of immunized mice. Initial characterization of the protective antigens in the bacterial culture supernatants revealed a subset of antigens that exhibited remarkable stability, a highly desirable characteristic of an effective vaccine to be used under suboptimal environmental conditions in developing countries. We were able to purify a subset of the peptides present in the supernatants and show their potential for immunization of mice against serovar Typhimurium resulting in a decreased level of colonization. This component vaccine shows promise with regard to protecting against NTS, and further work should significantly help to establish vaccines against these prevalent infections.--NEW SECTION--Salmonella enterica infections other than typhoid and paratyphoid fever are a major global health burden, as they cause high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Strategies that prevent Salmonella-related diseases are greatly needed, and there is a significant push for the development of vaccines against nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica serovars. In this work, we describe an S. Typhimurium supernatant-derived vaccine that is effective in reducing bacterial colonization in mouse models of gastroenteritis as well as invasive disease. This is a component vaccine that shows high stability to heat, a feature that is important for use under suboptimal conditions, such as those found in sub-Saharan Africa.",eng,mBio,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Inhibitors of sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) have proven effective against T. cruzi in vitro and in vivo in animal models of Chagas disease. Consequently two azole inhibitors of CYP51 (posaconazole and ravuconazole) have recently entered clinical development by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative. Further new drug treatments for this disease are however still urgently required, particularly having a different mode of action to CYP51 in order to balance the overall risk in the drug discovery portfolio. This need has now been further strengthened by the very recent reports of treatment failure in the clinic for both posaconazole and ravuconazole. To this end and to prevent enrichment of drug candidates against a single target, there is a clear need for a robust high throughput assay for CYP51 inhibition in order to evaluate compounds active against T. cruzi arising from phenotypic screens. A high throughput fluorescence based functional assay using recombinantly expressed T. cruzi CYP51 (Tulahuen strain) is presented here that meets this requirement. This assay has proved valuable in prioritising medicinal chemistry resource on only those T. cruzi active series arising from a phenotypic screening campaign where it is clear that the predominant mode of action is likely not via inhibition of CYP51.",eng,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Recently, there has been debate over whether an aggressive (i.e., high dose) or more moderate (i.e., lower dose) treatment of individuals will most limit the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. In this study, we demonstrate how one can understand and resolve these apparently contradictory conclusions. We show that a key determinant of which treatment strategy will perform best at the individual level is the extent of effective competition between resistant and sensitive pathogens within a host. We extend our analysis to the community level, exploring the spectrum between strict inter-strain competition and strain independence. From this perspective as well, we find that the magnitude of effective competition between resistant and sensitive strains determines whether an aggressive approach or moderate approach minimizes the burden of resistance in the population.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Wnt signalling, and more specifically β-catenin-related transcription, has been shown to drive both tumorigenesis and the metastatic process in colorectal neoplasia, yet its complex interactions with other key signalling pathways, such as hedgehog, remain to be elucidated. We have previously shown that the Hedgehog (HH) signalling pathway is active in cells from colorectal tumours, and that inhibition of the pathway with cyclopamine induces apoptosis. We now show that cyclopamine treatment reduces β-catenin related transcription in colorectal cancer cell lines, and that this effect can be reversed by addition of Sonic Hedgehog protein. We also show that cyclopamine concomitantly induces expression of the tumour suppressor and prognostic indicator E-cadherin. Consistent with a role for HH in regulating the invasive potential we show that cyclopamine reduces the expression of transcription factors (Slug, Snail and Twist) associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and reduces the invasiveness of colorectal cancer cells in vitro.

Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to filter PHI and GHI articles from the larger biomedical informatics domain. Articles were identified using MEDLINE as well as personal bibliographies from members of the American Medical Informatics Association PHI and GHI working groups.--NEW SECTION--A total of 85 PHI articles and 282 GHI articles were identified. While systems in PHI continue to support surveillance activities, we identified a shift towards support for prevention, environmental health, and public health care services. Furthermore, articles from the U.S. reveal a shift towards PHI applications at state and local levels. GHI articles focused on telemedicine, mHealth and eHealth applications. The development of adequate infrastructure to support ICT remains a challenge, although we identified a small but growing set of articles that measure the impact of ICT on clinical outcomes.--NEW SECTION--There is evidence of growth with respect to both implementation of information systems within the public health enterprise as well as a widening of scope within each informatics discipline. Yet the articles also illuminate the need for more primary research studies on what works and what does not as both searches yielded small numbers of primary, empirical articles.--NEW SECTION--While the body of knowledge around PHI and GHI continues to mature, additional studies of higher quality are needed to generate the robust evidence base needed to support continued investment in ICT by governmental health agencies.",eng,Online journal of public health informatics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are recognized drug treatments with limited clinical efficacy. It is uncertain if earlier initiation of these drugs will result in better outcomes in the longer term.--NEW SECTION--To evaluate the benefit of early treatment among people with AD.--NEW SECTION--Prospective randomized controlled trials were systematically searched from the OVID databases. The trials were eligible if study participants diagnosed with AD and were randomized to have early or late treatment. Any clinical assessment scales on cognitive function, physical function, behavioral problems, and the overall clinical status were the primary outcomes, and any reported adverse events were the secondary outcomes.--NEW SECTION--Ten randomized trials were identified between 2000 and 2010. A total of 3092 participants with AD with mean age 75.8 years were randomly assigned to receive early treatment or treatment delayed by placebo intervention for around 6 months. Compared with late treatment, early AD drug treatment showed no significant benefit on cognitive function [mean difference (MD) of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive Subscale = -0.49, 95% CI = -1.67 to 0.69], physical function (MD of Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory = 0.47, 95% CI = -1.44 to 2.39), behavioral problems (MD of Neuropsychiatric Inventory = -0.26, 95% CI = -2.70 to 2.18), and clinical status (MD of Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input = 0.02, 95% CI = -0.23 to 0.27).

CHIKV is a reemerging Alphavirus that causes acute febrile illness and severe and debilitating polyarthralgia of the peripheral joints. Huge epidemics and the rapid spread of CHIKV seen in India and the Indian Ocean region established CHIKV as a global health concern. This concern was further solidified by the recent incursion of the virus into the Western hemisphere, a region without pre-existing immunity. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) serve as excellent animal models for understanding CHIKV pathogenesis and pre-clinical assessment of vaccines and therapeutics. NHPs present advantages over rodent models because they are a natural amplification host for CHIKV and they share significant genetic and physiological homology with humans. CHIKV infection in NHPs results in acute fever, rash, viremia and production of type I interferon. NHPs develop CHIKV-specific B and T-cells, generating neutralizing antibodies and CHIKV-specific CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T-cells. CHIKV establishes a persistent infection in NHPs, particularly in cynomolgus macaques, because infectious virus could be recovered from spleen, liver, and muscle as late as 44 days post infection.

Surgical trauma is often referred to as the ""neglected step-child"" of global health in terms of patient numbers, mortality, morbidity, and costs. A staggering 234 million major surgeries are performed every year, and depending upon country and institution, up to 4% of patients will die before leaving hospital, up to 15% will have serious post-operative morbidity, and 5-15% will be readmitted within 30 days. These percentages equate to around 1000 deaths and 4000 major complications every hour, and it has been estimated that 50% may be preventable. New frontline drugs are urgently required to make major surgery safer for the patient and more predictable for the surgeon. We review the basic physiology of the stress response from neuroendocrine to genomic systems, and discuss the paucity of clinical data supporting the use of statins, beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium-channel blockers. Since cardiac-related complications are the most common, particularly in the elderly, a key strategy would be to improve ventricular-arterial coupling to safeguard the endothelium and maintain tissue oxygenation. Reduced O2 supply is associated with glycocalyx shedding, decreased endothelial barrier function, fluid leakage, inflammation, and coagulopathy. A healthy endothelium may prevent these ""secondary hit"" complications, including possibly immunosuppression. Thus, the four pillars of whole body resynchronization during surgical trauma, and targets for new therapies, are: (1) the CNS, (2) the heart, (3) arterial supply and venous return functions, and (4) the endothelium. This is termed the Central-Cardio-Vascular-Endothelium (CCVE) coupling hypothesis. Since similar sterile injury cascades exist in critical illness, accidental trauma, hemorrhage, cardiac arrest, infection and burns, new drugs that improve CCVE coupling may find wide utility in civilian and military medicine.",eng,Frontiers in surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Current drinking was reported by 36,030 (31%) individuals, and was associated with reduced myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.63-0.93]), but increased alcohol-related cancers (HR 1.51 [1.22-1.89]) and injury (HR 1.29 [1.04-1.61]). High intake was associated with increased mortality (HR 1.31 [1.04-1.66]). Compared with never drinkers, we identified significantly reduced hazards for the composite outcome for current drinkers in HICs and UMICs (HR 0.84 [0.77-0.92]), but not in LMICs and LICs, for which we identified no reductions in this outcome (HR 1.07 [0.95-1.21]; pinteraction<0.0001).--NEW SECTION--Current alcohol consumption had differing associations by clinical outcome, and differing associations by income region.

26385904,10.1177/0969733015602052,IJEPA: Gray Area for Health Policy and International Nurse Migration.,"Indonesia is recognized as a nurse exporting country, with policies that encourage nursing professionals to emigrate abroad. This includes the country's adoption of international principles attempting to protect Indonesian nurses that emigrate as well as the country's own participation in a bilateral trade and investment agreement, known as the Indonesia-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement that facilitates Indonesian nurse migration to Japan. Despite the potential trade and employment benefits from sending nurses abroad under the Indonesia-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, Indonesia itself is suffering from a crisis in nursing capacity and ensuring adequate healthcare access for its own populations. This represents a distinct challenge for Indonesia in appropriately balancing domestic health workforce needs, employment, and training opportunities for Indonesian nurses, and the need to acknowledge the rights of nurses to freely migrate abroad. Hence, this article reviews the complex operational and ethical issues associated with Indonesian health worker migration under the Indonesia-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. It also introduces a policy proposal to improve performance of the Indonesia-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement and better align it with international principles focused on equitable health worker migration.",eng,Nursing ethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Chemoradiation therapy, in comparison with radiation therapy, results in marginally improved survival in women with advanced cervical cancer. The impact on the quality of life due to the addition of a chemosensitizer in a situation of limited survival benefits warrants objective assessment. This prospective study compares the quality of life for women with cervical cancer and treated with radiation or chemoradiation therapy at Tygerberg Hospital, South Africa.--NEW SECTION--A prospective study was done in a population with a high incidence of advanced cervical cancer. Quality of life measurements were done at pretreatment, post treatment, and follow-up. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire and the Cervix Cancer Module were used.--NEW SECTION--The study included 219 women. Forty-four women were treated with primary surgery. A total of 102 women completed primary radiation therapy and 73 women completed primary chemoradiation therapy. The demographic characteristics of the last 2 treatment groups were different. Women receiving chemoradiation therapy had a higher educational level (P < 0.01) and had less advanced stage (III or IV) cervical cancer (P < 0.01). Radiation therapy was used significantly more in HIV-positive women. The presiding clinicians chose treatment options based on clinical factors unrelated to quality of life. Chemoradiation therapy resulted in statistically more improvement in the pain (P < 0.05), fatigue (P < 0.05), appetite loss (P < 0.01), and nausea and vomiting (P < 0.05) quality of life domains. In these domains, pretreatment quality of life scores were significantly higher in the radiation therapy group, implying a poorer quality of life status at the initiation of treatment. In post hoc analysis, the global health domain was significantly more improved (P = 0.03) by chemoradiation. Peripheral neuropathy was not increased by chemoradiation.--NEW SECTION--Chemoradiation therapy improved quality of life more than radiation therapy in certain domains. This allows for selection of chemoradiation as a treatment option in situations where quality of life is the end point of treatment.",eng,Clinical therapeutics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Socioeconomic inequalities contribute to a disparity in the burden of NCDs among disadvantaged and advantaged populations in low (LIC), middle (MIC), and high income countries (HIC). We conducted an overview of systematic reviews to systematically and objectively assess the available evidence on socioeconomic inequalities in relation to morbidity and mortality of NCDs and their risk factors.--NEW SECTION--We searched PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Global Health, and Business Source Complete for relevant systematic reviews published between 2003 and December 2013. Two authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications and determined the risk of bias of the included systematic reviews.--NEW SECTION--We screened 3302 abstracts, 173 full-text publications and ultimately included 22 systematic reviews. Most reviews had major methodological shortcomings; however, our synthesis showed that having low socioeconomic status (SES) and/or living in low and middle income countries (LMIC) increased the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD), lung and gastric cancer, type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, low SES increased the risk of mortality from lung cancer, COPD, and reduced breast cancer survival in HIC. Reviews included here indicated that lower SES is a risk factor for obesity in HIC, but this association varied by SES measure. Early case fatalities of stroke were lower and survival of retinoblastoma was higher in MIC compared to LIC.--NEW SECTION--The current evidence supports an association between socioeconomic inequalities and NCDs and risk factors for NCDs. However, this evidence is incomplete and limited by the fairly low methodological quality of the systematic reviews, including shortcomings in the study selection and quality assessment process.",eng,BMC public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The present standard of care, chemotherapy and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), results in a high proportion of patients being cured. In this study, we compare a chemotherapy-free ATRA and arsenic trioxide treatment regimen with the standard chemotherapy-based regimen (ATRA and idarubicin) in both high-risk and low-risk patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia.--NEW SECTION--In the randomised, controlled, multicentre, AML17 trial, eligible patients (aged ≥16 years) with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, confirmed by the presence of the PML-RARA transcript and without significant cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities or active malignancy, and who were not pregnant or breastfeeding, were enrolled from 81 UK hospitals and randomised 1:1 to receive treatment with ATRA and arsenic trioxide or ATRA and idarubicin. ATRA was given to participants in both groups in a daily divided oral dose of 45 mg/m(2) until remission, or until day 60, and then in a 2 weeks on-2 weeks off schedule. In the ATRA and idarubicin group, idarubicin was given intravenously at 12 mg/m(2) on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 of course 1, and then at 5 mg/m(2) on days 1-4 of course 2; mitoxantrone at 10 mg/m(2) on days 1-4 of course 3, and idarubicin at 12 mg/m(2) on day 1 of the final (fourth) course. In the ATRA and arsenic trioxide group, arsenic trioxide was given intravenously at 0·3 mg/kg on days 1-5 of each course, and at 0·25 mg/kg twice weekly in weeks 2-8 of course 1 and weeks 2-4 of courses 2-5. High-risk patients (those presenting with a white blood cell count >10 × 10(9) cells per L) could receive an initial dose of the immunoconjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin (6 mg/m(2) intravenously). Neither maintenance treatment nor CNS prophylaxis was given to patients in either group. All patients were monitored by real-time quantitative PCR. Allocation was by central computer minimisation, stratified by age, performance status, and de-novo versus secondary disease. The primary endpoint was quality of life on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 global health status. All analyses are by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN55675535.--NEW SECTION--Between May 8, 2009, and Oct 3, 2013, 235 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to ATRA and idarubicin (n=119) or ATRA and arsenic trioxide (n=116). Participants had a median age of 47 years (range 16-77; IQR 33-58) and included 57 high-risk patients. Quality of life did not differ significantly between the treatment groups (EORTC QLQ-C30 global functioning effect size 2·17 [95% CI -2·79 to 7·12; p=0·39]). Overall, 57 patients in the ATRA and idarubicin group and 40 patients in the ATRA and arsenic trioxide group reported grade 3-4 toxicities. After course 1 of treatment, grade 3-4 alopecia was reported in 23 (23%) of 98 patients in the ATRA and idarubicin group versus 5 (5%) of 95 in the ATRA and arsenic trioxide group, raised liver alanine transaminase in 11 (10%) of 108 versus 27 (25%) of 109, oral toxicity in 22 (19%) of 115 versus one (1%) of 109. After course 2 of treatment, grade 3-4 alopecia was reported in 25 (28%) of 89 patients in the ATRA and idarubicin group versus 2 (3%) of 77 in the ATRA and arsenic trioxide group; no other toxicities reached the 10% level. Patients in the ATRA and arsenic trioxide group had significantly less requirement for most aspects of supportive care than did those in the ATRA and idarubicin group.--NEW SECTION--ATRA and arsenic trioxide is a feasible treatment in low-risk and high-risk patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, with a high cure rate and less relapse than, and survival not different to, ATRA and idarubicin, with a low incidence of liver toxicity.

Effective treatment is not available in many affected areas, and the Plasmodium falciparum parasite is becoming resistant to existing drugs. Alternative therapies are necessary to overcome these challenges. Borassus aethiopum is the third most used palm species in traditional medicines in Africa. Yet, there is only limited information substantiating medicinal properties of the palm. The objective of this study was to document medicinal uses of B. aethiopum and investigate anti-plasmodial activity of the palm extracts used in traditional medicine to treat malaria.--NEW SECTION--The fieldwork and collection of samples was done in Ghana in the Greater Accra, Brong Ahafo, and Volta regions. Our ethnomedicinal survey did not specifically focus on medicinal uses against malaria; any medicinal application of B. aethiopum was of interest. Data collection employed a structured questionnaire, open-ended questions, and group discussion. The experimental extraction of samples was carried out using three common solvents: distilled water, absolute ethanol, and dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). Anti-plasmodial activity of compounds was determined against erythrocytic stages of the FCR3 strain of P. falciparum by a [3H]-hypoxanthine incorporation assay.--NEW SECTION--A total of 37 use records were documented regarding the medicinal uses of B. aethiopum for the management of 24 different disorders. The highest medicinal use value was recorded for the use of B. aethiopum against malaria, and a subsequent laboratory investigation focused on evaluating anti-plasmodial activity of the palm. Several root and leaf extracts displayed anti-plasmodial activity, with the highest (78% at 50 μg/mL) elicited by one of the dichloromethane root extracts.--NEW SECTION--Our results demonstrate the value of integrating ethnobotanical and pharmacological research in the study of beneficial effects of palm products on human health. While the high inhibitory activity found in dichloromethane extracts cannot validate the ethnomedicinal use, the anti-plasmodial effect observed cannot be nullified. We brought preliminary evidence that this palm is a promising source of alternative medicines that could contribute to improving health conditions in malaria endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa.",eng,Journal of ethnopharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Despite significant advances in TB detection strategies in recent years, a bigger push toward detecting TB in the shortest and easiest way possible at the point-of-care (POC) is still in demand. To this end, we have designed a simple yet rapid and sensitive bioassay that detects Mtb DNA electrochemically using colloidal gold nanoparticles. This assay couples rapid isothermal amplification of target DNA that is specific to Mtb with gold nanoparticle electrochemistry on disposable screen printed carbon electrodes. The assay is capable of detecting a positive differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) response from as low as 1 CFU of Mtb bacilli DNA input material, having shown its exquisite sensitivity over a conventional gel based readout. The translation of our assay onto a portable potentiostat was also demonstrated, with promising results. We believe that our assay has significant potential for translation into broader bioassay applications or development as a POC diagnostic tool.",eng,Analytical chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Although T2D has a strong genetic etiology, limited knowledge exists about the common variants associated with it in the black South African population. This study set out to evaluate the association of previously reported common variants in other world populations with T2D susceptibility in a black South African population of Setswana descent. A case-control study design of 178 cases and 178 controls nested in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study was conducted wherein we genotyped for 77 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). PLINK software was used to evaluate the standard genetic models of disease penetrance for the association of the common variants with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) while adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. Only rs1436955 significantly associated with an increase in T2D risk; three other variants, rs831571, rs8050136, and rs7542900, significantly associated with decreased risk of T2D. However, none of the four SNPs had significant associations after correcting for multiple testing (p<0.05). Although further studies are required to confirm these observations, the common variants associated with T2D risk among the Black South Africans of Setswana descent might likely be different than those in the Asian and European populations. This study supports the broader thesis that the genetic background of Africans is diverse and cannot be directly extrapolated using genetic variants from other ethnicities. Therefore there is a need to identify the population-specific variants linked with T2D in Africa.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26381878,10.1186/s12879-015-1113-7,Health and economic consequences of different options for timing the coordinated global cessation of the three oral poliovirus vaccine serotypes.,"World leaders remain committed to globally-coordinated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation following successful eradication of wild polioviruses, but the best timing and strategy for implementation depend on existing and emerging conditions.--NEW SECTION--Using an existing integrated global poliovirus risk management model, we explore alternatives to the current timing plan of coordinated cessation of each OPV serotype (i.e., OPV1, OPV2, and OPV3 cessation for serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). We assume the current timing plan involves OPV2 cessation in 2016 followed by OPV1 and OPV3 cessation in 2019 and we compare this to alternative timing options, including cessation of all three serotypes in 2018 or 2019, and cessation of both OPV2 and OPV3 in 2017 followed by OPV1 in 2019.--NEW SECTION--If Supplemtal Immunization Activity frequency remains sufficiently high through cessation of the last OPV serotype, then all OPV cessation timing options prevent circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks after OPV cessation of any serotype. The various OPV cessation timing options result in relatively modest differences in expected vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis cases and expected total of approximately 10-13 billion polio vaccine doses used. However, the expected amounts of vaccine of different OPV formulations needed changes dramatically with each OPV cessation timing option. Overall health economic impacts remain limited for timing options that only change the OPV formulation but preserve the currently planned year for cessation of the last OPV serotype and the global introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) introduction. Earlier cessation of the last OPV serotype or later global IPV introduction yield approximately $1 billion in incremental net benefits due to saved vaccination costs, although the logistics of implementation of OPV cessation remain uncertain and challenging.--NEW SECTION--All countries should maintain the highest possible levels of population immunity to transmission for each poliovirus serotype prior to the coordinated cessation of the OPV serotype to manage cVDPV risks. If OPV2 cessation gets delayed, then global health leaders should consider other OPV cessation timing options.",eng,BMC infectious diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The Besrour Papers Working Group, which was struck at the 2013 conference, was tasked with developing a series of papers to highlight the key issues, lessons learned, and outcomes emerging from the various activities of the Besrour collaboration. The working group comprised members of various academic departments of family medicine in Canada and abroad who attended the conferences.--NEW SECTION--We performed a scoping review to determine the methodologic obstacles to understanding the positive effects of family medicine globally.--NEW SECTION--The main obstacle to evaluating family medicine globally is that one of its core dimensions and assets is its local adaptability. Family medicine takes on very different roles in different health systems, making aggregation of data difficult. In many countries family medicine competes with other disciplines rather than performing a gatekeeping role. Further, most research that has been conducted thus far comes from industrialized contexts, and patient continuity and its benefits might not be achievable in the short term in developing countries when clinical demands are great. We must find frameworks to permit strengthening the evidentiary basis of the discipline across different contexts without sacrificing its beneficial adaptability.--NEW SECTION--We believe that developing family medicine and its attributes is one of the keys to achieving global health. These attributes—including its comprehensiveness, adaptability, and attention to both local and patient needs—are key to advancing global health priorities, but make common evaluative frameworks for the discipline a challenge. The spread of family medicine over the past decades is indirect evidence of its utility, but we need to generate more evidence.

Both emergencies can be seen as testing moments, challenging the current model of epidemic governance, where two worldviews co-exist: global health security and humanitarian biomedicine.--NEW SECTION--The resurgence of polio and the spread of Ebola in 2014 have not only exposed the weaknesses of national health systems, but also the shortcomings of the current global health regime in dealing with transnational epidemic threats. These shortcomings are of three sorts. Firstly, the global health regime is fragmented and dominated by the domestic security priorities of industrialised nations. Secondly, the WHO has been constrained by constitutional country allegiances, crippling reforms and the limited impact of the (2005) International Health Regulations (IHR) framework. Thirdly, the securitization of infectious diseases and the militarization of humanitarian aid undermine the establishment of credible public health surveillance networks and the capacity to control epidemic threats.--NEW SECTION--The securitization of communicable diseases has so far led foreign aid policies to sideline health systems. It has also been the source of ongoing misperceptions over the aims of global health initiatives. With its strict allegiance to Member States, the WHO mandate is problematic, particularly when it comes to controlling epidemic diseases. In this context, humanitarian medical organizations are expected to palliate the absence of public health services in the most destitute areas, particularly in conflict zones. The militarization of humanitarian aid itself threatens this fragile and imperfect equilibrium. None of the reforms announced by the WHO in the wake of the 68(th) World Health Assembly address these fundamental issues.",eng,Conflict and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Cervical cancer treatment of HIV-positive women poses challenges. Treatment-related changes in quality of life (QOL) of such women are important to future treatment protocols.--NEW SECTION--To examine demographic data of HIV-negative and HIV-positive women at diagnosis of cervical cancer and describe their changes in QOL as a result of treatment.--NEW SECTION--All newly diagnosed patients with cervical cancer at Tygerberg Hospital were approached to participate in the study. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Cervix Cancer Module (QLQ-CX24) were used. General QOL was measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and cervical-specific QOL with the QLQ-CX24 questionnaire. The patients completed the questionnaire at diagnosis, on completion of treatment and at 3 months' follow-up.--NEW SECTION--The study included a total of 221 women of whom 22% were HIV-positive; the latter were younger and of higher educational level than the rest. Mean monthly income and stage distribution was similar between the two groups. HIV-positive patients underwent radiation therapy more commonly than chemoradiation. HIV-positive women showed statistically significantly higher loss to follow-up during the study. HIV-positive women experienced no improvement in insomnia, appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, social role or any of the sexual domains. In contrast, HIV-negative women experienced statistically significant improvement in all sexual domains other than sexual/vaginal functioning. The QOL improvement of HIV-negative women was statistically significantly greater than their HIV-positive counterparts in the majority of QOL domains. Global health improved in both groups, with HIV-negative women experiencing greater improvement. HIV-positive women experienced an initial decline of peripheral neuropathy (PN) symptoms post treatment with a return to pretreatment values at 3 months' follow-up. The change in PN was statistically significant between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive women.--NEW SECTION--Demographic differences exist between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive groups.

There is limited evidence, however, of the effectiveness of these policy-level changes among individuals with anxiety or depression.--NEW SECTION--To assess the impact of a multifaceted VBBD policy that incorporates waived copayments, wellness offerings, and on-site services on medication adherence among plan members with anxiety or depression, and to explore how this intervention and its resulting improved adherence affects other health-related outcomes.--NEW SECTION--A retrospective longitudinal pre/post design was utilized to measure outcomes before and after the VBBD policy change. Repeated measures statistical regression models with correlated error terms were utilized to evaluate outcomes among employees of a self-insured global health company and their spouses (N = 529) who had anxiety or depression after the VBBD policy change. A multivariable linear regression model was chosen as the best fit to evaluate a change in medication possession ratio (MPR) after comparing parameters for several distributions. The repeated measures multivariable regression models were adjusted for baseline MPR and potential confounders, including continuous age, sex, continuous modified Charlson Comorbidity Index, and the continuous number of prescriptions filled that year.

In our previous study, an ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIm][PF6]) had been proven to facilitate the dissemination of ARGs in the environment. However, enhanced alkyl group chain length or the substitution of alkyl groups with the cation ring corresponded with increased antimicrobial effects. In this study, we investigated how different structures of ILs with 4, 6, and 8 C atoms in the longer alkyl chain on the imidazolium cations facilitated the dissemination of ARGs. The promotion of plasmid RP4 transfer frequency decreased with [CnMIM][BF4] increasing the alkyl chain length from 4 carbon atoms to 8 carbon atoms on the imidazolium cations, which is observed with [BMIM][BF4] (n = 4, 5.9 fold) > HMIM][BF4] (n = 6, 2.2 fold) > [OMIM][BF4] (n = 8, 1.7 fold). This illustrates that [CnMIM][BF4] with increasing the alkyl chain length exert decreasing ability in facilitating plasmid RP4 horizontal transfer, which is possibly related to IL-structure dependent toxicity. The IL-structure dependent plasmid RP4 transfer frequency was attributable to bacterial cell membrane permeability weaken with increasing alkyl chain length of [CnMIM][PF4], which was evidenced by flow cytometry. In freshwater microcosm, [CnMIm][BF4] promoted the relative abundance of the sulI and intI genes for 4.6 folds, aphA and traF for 5.2 folds higher than the untreated groups, promoting the propagation of ARGs in the aquatic environment. This is the first report that ILs with different structure of varying alkyl chain length facilitate horizontal transfer of plasmid RP4 which is widely distributed in the environment, and thus add the adverse effects of the environmental risk of ILs.",eng,Frontiers in microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26379391,10.3748/wjg.v21.i34.9838,Recent advances in the molecular diagnostics of gastric cancer.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death in the world, representing a major global health issue. Although the incidence of GC is declining, the outcomes for GC patients remain dismal because of the lack of effective biomarkers to detect early GC and predict both recurrence and chemosensitivity. Current tumor markers for GC, including serum carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, are not ideal due to their relatively low sensitivity and specificity. Recent improvements in molecular techniques are better able to identify aberrant expression of GC-related molecules, including oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, and DNA methylation, as novel molecular markers, although the molecular pathogenesis of GC is complicated by tumor heterogeneity. Detection of genetic and epigenetic alterations from gastric tissue or blood samples has diagnostic value in the management of GC. There are high expectations for molecular markers that can be used as new screening tools for early detection of GC as well as for patient stratification towards personalized treatment of GC through prediction of prognosis and drug-sensitivity. In this review, the studies of potential molecular biomarkers for GC that have been reported in the publicly available literature between 2012 and 2015 are reviewed and summarized, and certain highlighted papers are examined.",eng,World journal of gastroenterology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The study included patients aged 65 years and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, and thoracic cancer. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group, i.e. patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping, or to the control group, which received standard care. Randomization was done by block randomization in blocks of four in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months.--NEW SECTION--Overall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 ± 4.9 years, and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7-14 day). There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group. Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery, length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional state, and pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the Timed Up and Go-test by multiple robust regressions.--NEW SECTION--Patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping did not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain.

This study was performed to examine whether the Lower Extremity/Mobility (LE) CP-CAT detects change in mobility following orthopaedic surgery in children with CP.--NEW SECTION--This multicenter, longitudinal study involved administration of the LE CP-CAT, the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) Transfer/Mobility and Sports/Physical Functioning domains, and the Timed ""Up & Go"" test (TUG) before and after elective orthopaedic surgery in a convenience sample of 255 children, four to twenty years of age, who had CP and a Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level of I, II, or III. Standardized response means (SRMs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all measures at six, twelve, and twenty-four months following surgery.--NEW SECTION--SRM estimates for the LE CP-CAT were significantly greater than the SRM estimates for the PODCI Transfer/Mobility domain at twelve months, the PODCI Sports/Physical Functioning domain at twelve months, and the TUG at twelve and twenty-four months. When the results for the children at GMFCS levels I, II, and III were grouped together, the improvements in function detected by the LE CP-CAT at twelve and twenty-four months were found to be greater than the changes detected by the PODCI Transfer/Mobility and Sports/Physical Functioning scales. The LE CP-CAT outperformed the PODCI scales for GMFCS levels I and III at both of these follow-up intervals; none of the scales performed well for patients with GMFCS level II.--NEW SECTION--The results of this study showed that the LE CP-CAT displayed superior sensitivity to change than the PODCI and TUG scales after musculoskeletal surgery in children with CP.",eng,The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

However, the dynamics of participatory behavior by crowds in such interventions have yet to be examined. This article reports results from a baseline evaluation of one such intervention called Mo-Buzz, a mobile-based crowdsource-driven socially mediated system developed to address gaps in dengue surveillance and education in Colombo, Sri Lanka. We conducted a 30-minute cross-sectional field survey (N = 404) among potential users of Mo-Buzz in Colombo. We examined individual, institutional, and cultural factors that influence their potential intention-to-use Mo-Buzz and assessed if these factors varied by demographic factors. Descriptive analysis revealed high perceived ease-of-use (PEOU; M = 3.81, SD = 0.44), perceived usefulness (PU; M = 4.01, SD = 0.48), and intention-to-use (PI; M = 3.91, SD = 0.46) among participants. Analysis of variance suggested participants in the 31 to 40 years age group reported highest PEOU, whereas the oldest group reported high perceived institutional efficacy (M = 3.59, SD = 0.64) and collectivistic tendencies. Significant differences (at the p < .05 level) were also found by education and income. Regression analysis demonstrated that PU, behavioral control, institutional efficacy, and collectivism were significant predictors of PI. We concluded that despite high overall PI, future adoption and use of Mo-Buzz will be shaped by a complex mix of factors at different levels of the public health ecology. Implications of study findings from theoretical and practical perspectives related to the future adoption of mobile-based participatory systems in public health are discussed and ideas for a future research agenda presented.",eng,Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016

Such discrepancies in estimates of abortion-related mortality present an important opportunity to explore unique challenges and opportunities associated with the generation and interpretation of abortion-related mortality estimates. While innovations in primary data collection and estimation methodologies are much needed, at the very least, studies that seek to measure maternal deaths due to abortion should endeavor to improve transparency, acknowledge limitations of data, and contextualize results.

The literature surrounding quality of life (QoL) in patients undergoing PE is limited. Furthermore, there are no matched comparisons of QoL between abdominoperineal resection (APR) and PE. The aim of this study was to compare differences in long-term QoL for patients with primary rectal cancer undergoing APR versus PE.--NEW SECTION--All patients who underwent either APR or PE between January 2011 and December 2012 were identified. Patients were asked to complete the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire before surgery and 2 weeks afterwards. Subsequent questionnaires were requested at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after operation.--NEW SECTION--A total of 110 patients were included in the study (54 APR, 56 PE). Median length of stay following operation was 11 (range 3-70) days for APR and 15 (7-84) days for PE. Patients undergoing PE experienced lower physical (mean score 42 versus 56; P = 0.010), role (20 versus 33; P = 0.047), emotional (57 versus 73; P = 0.010) and social (34 versus 52; P = 0.005) functional levels 2 weeks after surgery. Long-term dyspnoea and financial worries were experienced only after PE. Patients undergoing PE had a lower overall global health status at 2 weeks after operation (40 versus 53; P = 0.012).

Twelve (66.6%) studies had either low or moderate risk of bias. Hypoxaemia defined as oxygen saturation rate (SpO2) <90% associated with significantly increased odds of death from ALRI (OR 5.47, 95% CI 3.93 to 7.63) in 12 studies on 13,936 children. An Sp02 <92% associated with a similar increased risk of mortality (OR 3.66, 95% CI 1.42 to 9.47) in 3 studies on 673 children.

This mutation load has the potential to shape patterns of adaptive evolution via genetic linkage to beneficial mutations. Here, we examine the effect of deleterious mutations on patterns of influenza A subtype H3N2's antigenic evolution in humans. By first analyzing simple models of influenza that incorporate a mutation load, we show that deleterious mutations, as expected, act to slow the virus's rate of antigenic evolution, while making it more punctuated in nature. These models further predict three distinct molecular pathways by which antigenic cluster transitions occur, and we find phylogenetic patterns consistent with each of these pathways in influenza virus sequences. Simulations of a more complex phylodynamic model further indicate that antigenic mutations act in concert with deleterious mutations to reproduce influenza's spindly hemagglutinin phylogeny, co-circulation of antigenic variants, and high annual attack rates.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Participants enrolled ranged from 50 to 71 years of age, residing in six U.S. states and two cities. Cox proportional hazard models yielded hazard ratio (HR) estimates per 10 μg/m3 of PM2.5 exposure.--NEW SECTION--PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with total mortality (HR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.05) and CVD mortality (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.15), but the association with respiratory mortality was not statistically significant (HR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.13).

Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) efficiently inactivate a broad range of β-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems, and are often coexpressed with other antibacterial resistance factors. The rapid dissemination of MBLs and lack of novel antibacterials pose an imminent threat to global health. In an effort to better counter these resistance-conferring β-lactamases, an investigation of their natural evolution and resulting substrate specificity was employed. In this study, we elucidated the effects of different amino acid substitutions at position 67 in IMP-type MBLs on the ability to hydrolyze and confer resistance to a range of β-lactam antibiotics. Wild-type β-lactamases IMP-1 and IMP-10 and mutants IMP-1-V67A and IMP-1-V67I were characterized biophysically and biochemically, and MICs for Escherichia coli cells expressing these enzymes were determined. We found that all variants exhibited catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) equal to or higher than that of IMP-1 against all tested β-lactams except penicillins, against which IMP-1 and IMP-1-V67I showed the highest kcat/Km values. The substrate-specific effects of the different amino acid substitutions at position 67 are discussed in light of their side chain structures and possible interactions with the substrates. Docking calculations were employed to investigate interactions between different side chains and an inhibitor used as a β-lactam surrogate. The differences in binding affinities determined experimentally and computationally seem to be governed by hydrophobic interactions between residue 67 and the inhibitor and, by inference, the β-lactam substrates.",eng,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Exposure to arsenic can disrupt spatial memory; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we tested whether exercise could interfere with the effect of arsenic exposure on the long-term memory (LTM) of object recognition in mice. Arsenic (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/ kg, i.g.) was administered daily for 12 weeks. We found that arsenic at dosages of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg decreased body weight and increased the arsenic content in the brain. The object recognition LTM (tested 24 h after training) was disrupted by 3 mg/ kg and 10 mg/ kg, but not 1 mg/ kg arsenic exposure. Swimming exercise also prevented LTM impairment induced by 3 mg/ kg, but not with 10 mg/ kg, of arsenic exposure. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (pCREB) in the CA1 and dentate gyrus areas (DG) of the dorsal hippocampus were decreased by 3 mg/ kg and 10 mg/ kg, but not by 1 mg/ kg, of arsenic exposure.

26366470,10.3111/13696998.2015.1093493,Comparison of historical medical spending patterns among the BRICS and G7.,"The past few decades have been marked by a bold increase in national health spending across the globe. Rather successful health reforms in leading emerging markets such as BRICS reveal a reshaping of their medical care-related expenditures. There is a scarcity of evidence explaining differences in long-term medical spending patterns between top ranked G7 traditional welfare economies and the BRICS nations.--NEW SECTION--A retrospective observational study was conducted on a longitudinal WHO Global Health Expenditure data-set based on the National Health Accounts (NHA) system. Data were presented in a simple descriptive manner, pointing out health expenditure dynamics and differences between the two country groups (BRICS and G7) and individual nations in a 1995-2013 time horizon.--NEW SECTION--Average total per capita health spending still remains substantially higher among G7 (4747 Purchase Power Parity (PPP) $PPP in 2013) compared to the BRICS (1004 $PPP in 2013) nations. The percentage point share of G7 in global health expenditure (million current PPP international $US) has been falling constantly since 1995 (from 65% in 1995 to 53.2% in 2013), while in BRICS nations it grew (from 10.7% in 1995 to 20.2% in 2013). Chinese national level medical spending exceeded significantly that of all G7 members except the US in terms of current $PPP in 2013.--NEW SECTION--Within a limited time horizon of only 19 years it appears that the share of global medical spending by the leading emerging markets has been growing steadily. Simultaneously, the world's richest countries' global share has been falling constantly, although it continues to dominate the landscape. If the contemporary global economic mainstream continues, the BRICS per capita will most likely reach or exceed the OECD average in future decades. Rising out-of-pocket expenses threatening affordability of medical care to poor citizens among the BRICS nations and a too low percentage of GDP in India remain the most notable setbacks of these developments.",eng,Journal of medical economics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

While epidemiologists and public health practitioners and scholars have long expressed concern with the changing global distribution of the burden of NCDs, it is only in more recent years that the aetiology, politics and consequences of these shifts have become an object of critical social scientific enquiry. These shifts mark the starting point for this special issue on 'The Politics of NCDs in the Global South' and act as the basis for new, critical interventions in how we understand NCDs. In this paper, we aim not only to introduce and contextualise the six contributions that form this special issue, but also to identify and explore three themes - problematisation, care and culture - that index the main areas of analytical and empirical concern that have motivated analyses of NCDs in the global South and are central to critical engagement with their political contours.",eng,Health & place,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The recent nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals in Seoul, Korea and at the National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia indicate the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV. Currently there are no effective anti-MERS-CoV anti-viral agents or therapeutics and MERS is associated with a high mortality rate (40%) in hospitalised patients. A large proportion of MERS patients who die have a range of pulmonary pathology ranging from pneumonia to adult respiratory distress syndrome with multi-organ failure, compounded by co-morbidities, reflecting a precarious balance of interactions between the host-immune system and MERS-CoV. Whilst we wait for new MERS-CoV specific drugs, therapeutics and vaccines to be developed, there is a need to advance a range of Host-Directed Therapies. A range of HDTs are available, including commonly used drugs with good safety profiles, which could augment host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms to MERS-CoV, modulate excessive inflammation and reduce lung tissue destruction. We discuss the rationale and potential of using Host-Directed Therapies for improving the poor treatment outcomes associated with MERS. Carefully designed randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine whether HDTs could benefit patients with MERS. The recurrent outbreaks of MERS-CoV infections at hospitals in the Middle East present unique opportunities to conduct randomized clinical trials. The time has come for a more coordinated global response to MERS and a multidisciplinary global MERS-CoV response group is required to take forward priority research agendas.",eng,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,Editorial,2025-04-23,2015

For effective control of this dreadful disease, it is necessary to diagnose TB cases at the initial stages of infection. The serodiagnosis of disease represents simple, rapid and inexpensive method that can be used at the primary health care levels. In this study we have compared sensitivity of two PPE proteins of M. tuberculosis, i.e., Rv0256c and Rv1168c for their use as serodiagnostic markers in active tuberculosis patients. Employing a standardized enzyme immunoassay with these PPE proteins as candidate antigens we were able to successfully discriminate the TB patients' sera from the BCG-vaccinated healthy controls. Further, we observed that Rv1168c displayed higher sensitivity in detecting extrapulmonary and smear negative pulmonary TB cases which are difficult to diagnose by available diagnostic methods. Overall the study highlights that Rv1168c can be used as a potential serodiagnostic marker for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis disease.",eng,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

High HIV prevalence in rural former apartheid homeland areas suggests substantial aging with HIV and acquisition of HIV at older ages. We develop a life course approach to HIV vulnerability, highlighting the rise and fall of risk and protection as people age, as well as the role of contextual density in shaping HIV vulnerability. Using this approach, we draw on an innovative multi-method data set collected within the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System in South Africa, combining survey data with 60 nested life history interviews and 9 community focus group interviews. We examine HIV risk and protective factors among adults aged 40-80, as well as how and why these factors vary among people at older ages.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Insulin resistance is closely associated with obesity and precedes the development of type 2 diabetes. However, there is now increasing evidence to suggest that diet itself may independently be associated with type 2 diabetes risk. A diet with a high acid load (or high potential renal net acid load, PRAL) can result in a decrease in pH towards the lower end of the normal physiological range, which may in turn lead to the development of insulin resistance. Conversely, reducing dietary acid load (the so called 'alkaline diet') may be protective and prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes. Here, we explore the influence of dietary acid load on the development of mild metabolic acidosis and induction of insulin resistance. Whilst large prospective cohort studies link high dietary acid load or low serum bicarbonate with the development of type 2 diabetes, the effect of a diet with a low acid (or high alkaline) load remains unclear. Further interventional studies are required to investigate the influence of dietary composition on the body's acid/base balance, insulin resistance and incidence of type 2 diabetes.",eng,Biochimie,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26362420,10.3402/gha.v8.28041,A community-driven hypertension treatment group in rural Honduras.,"We formed a self-funded hypertension treatment group in a resource-poor community in rural Honduras. After training community health workers and creating protocols for standardized treatment, we used group membership fees to maintain the group, purchase generic medications in bulk on the local market, and hire a physician to manage treatment. We then assessed whether participation in the group improved treatment, medication adherence, and hypertension control.--NEW SECTION--This is a program evaluation using quasi-experimental design and no control group. Using data from the 86 members of the hypertension treatment group, we analyzed baseline and follow-up surveys of members, along with 30 months of clinical records of treatment, medication adherence, and blood pressure readings.--NEW SECTION--Our initial hypertension needs assessment revealed that at baseline, community hypertensives relied on the local Ministry of Health clinic as their source of anti-hypertensive medications and reported that irregular supply interfered with medication adherence. At baseline, hypertension group members were mainly female, overweight or obese, physically active, non-smoking, and non-drinking. After 30 months of managing the treatment group, we found a significant increase in medication adherence, from 54.8 to 76.2% (p<0.01), and hypertension control (<140/90 mmHg), from 31.4 to 54.7% (p<0.01). We also found a mean monthly decrease of 0.39 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (p<0.01). At the end of the 30-month observation period, the local Ministry of Health system had increased provision of low-cost anti-hypertensive medications and adopted the hypertension treatment group's treatment protocols.--NEW SECTION--Formation of a self-funded, community-based hypertension treatment group in a rural, resource-poor community is feasible, and group participation may improve treatment, medication adherence, and hypertension control and can serve as a political driver for improving hypertension treatment services provided by the public system.",eng,Global health action,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The strength of evidence was adjudicated using both the Oxford and GRADE methodology by two independent reviewers.--NEW SECTION--Overall, 13 studies were identified, with 11 manuscripts and 2 meeting abstracts. Seventy-six adult patients were treated for 82 episodes of SE/RSE. Patients had varying numbers of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), 1-12, on board prior to lidocaine therapy. During 69 of the 82 (84.1%) episodes of SE/RSE, phenytoin was on board. The dose regimen of lidocaine varied, with some utilizing bolus dosing alone; others utilizing a combination of bolus and infusion therapy. Overall, 70.7% of seizures responded to lidocaine, with complete cessation and greater than 50% reduction seen in 64.1% and 6.1% respectively. Patient outcomes were sparingly reported.--NEW SECTION--There currently exists level 4, GRADE C evidence to support the consideration of lidocaine for SE and RSE in the adult population. Thus there is currently weak evidence to support the use of lidocaine in this context. Further prospective studies of lidocaine administration in this setting are warranted.",eng,Seizure,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This research project aimed to determine the most effective means to teach bedside ultrasound to medical students in a 1-week training course. We hypothesized that the best method would include a combination of podcasts and hands-on teaching; therefore, there would be a statistically significant difference among the various methods of teaching.--NEW SECTION--Medical students were randomly assigned to 3 groups. All groups attended a 50-minute hands-on bedside ultrasound training session. Students in the first group attended a 50-minute live lecture before the hands-on session, whereas students in the second group watched a podcast that covered the same material as the live lecture. Students in the third group served as the control and only attended the hands-on sessions. Five topics were covered during the course: (1) introduction to ultrasound, (2) pulmonary ultrasound, (3) cardiac ultrasound, (4) hepatobiliary ultrasound, and (5) focused assessment with sonography for trauma. Students completed a 20-question pre- and post-training quiz that covered basic ultrasound principles. Students also conducted a focused assessment with sonography for trauma examination for the practical portion of their evaluation.--NEW SECTION--Students' pre- to post-training quiz scores increased from 33.6% to 72.6% correct in the lecture group (n = 21; P < .0001), from 40.7% to 75.5% correct in the podcast group (n = 20; P< .0001), and from 37.8% to 70.0% correct in the control group (n = 23; P< .0001). Data analysis of written and practical examination scores showed no significant differences among the groups [F(2,61) = 0.885; P = .418; F(2,60) = 1.739; P = .184, respectively].--NEW SECTION--These results suggest that all 3 methods are equally effective in teaching novice medical students basic ultrasound knowledge and skills.",eng,Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

26360801,10.1111/pbi.12476,Expression of β-glucosidase increases trichome density and artemisinin content in transgenic Artemisia annua plants.,"Artemisinin is highly effective against multidrug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, the aetiological agent of the most severe form of malaria. However, a low level of accumulation of artemisinin in Artemisia annua is a major limitation for its production and delivery to malaria endemic areas of the world. While several strategies to enhance artemisinin have been extensively explored, enhancing storage capacity in trichome has not yet been considered. Therefore, trichome density was increased with the expression of β-glucosidase (bgl1) gene in A. annua through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgene (bgl1) integration and transcript were confirmed by molecular analysis. Trichome density increased up to 20% in leaves and 66% in flowers of BGL1 transgenic plants than Artemisia control plants. High-performance liquid chromatography, time of flight mass spectrometer data showed that artemisinin content increased up to 1.4% in leaf and 2.56% in flowers (per g DW), similar to the highest yields achieved so far through metabolic engineering. Artemisinin was enhanced up to five-fold in BGL1 transgenic flowers. This study opens the possibility of increasing artemisinin content by manipulating trichomes' density, which is a major reservoir of artemisinin. Combining biosynthetic pathway engineering with enhancing trichome density may further increase artemisinin yield in A. annua. Because oral feeding of Artemisia plant cells reduced parasitemia more efficiently than the purified drug, reduced drug resistance and cost of prohibitively expensive purification process, enhanced expression should play a key role in making this valuable drug affordable to treat malaria in a large global population that disproportionally impacts low-socioeconomic areas and underprivileged children.",eng,Plant biotechnology journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The study adapts the Global Health Workforce Alliance/World Health Organization four-dimensional framework of HRH in the context of governance for universal health coverage. A set of proxies was established for the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of HRH. Analysis of official HRH documentation from relevant institutions and reports were used to construct a governance profile of HRH for Serbia from the introduction of the reform in 2003 up to 2013. The results show that all Serbian districts (except Sremski) surpass the availability threshold of 59.4 skilled midwives, nurses and physicians per 10,000 inhabitants. District accessibility of health workforce greatly differed from the national average with variances from +26% to -34%. Analysis of national averages and patient load of general practitioners showed variances among districts by ± 21%, whilst hospital discharges per 100 inhabitants deviated between +52% and -45%. Pre-service and in-service education of health workforce is regulated and accredited.

In this article we first ask what causes the access gap with respect to lifesaving essential noncommunicable disease medicines and then what can be done to close the gap. Using the example of the push for access to antiretrovirals for HIV/AIDS patients for comparison, we highlight the problems of inadequate global financing and procurement for noncommunicable disease medications, intellectual property barriers and concerns raised by the pharmaceutical industry, and challenges to building stronger civil-society organizations and a patient and humanitarian response from the bottom up to demand treatment.

More people are developing cancer, and as standards of care have risen, more are surviving and requiring longer-term care. Precision medicine promises better outcomes but demands commensurately higher payments for care. As both incidence and per case costs rise, we suggest that the task of expanding access to high-quality cancer care poses a ""value challenge"" that policies in many countries are inadequate to meet. Policy makers should respond with a new approach. We explore questions that policy makers will need to consider regarding objectives, barriers, and levers for policy development. We use transparency and accountability as cornerstones of a new approach to promote value-based decision making. Although barriers to advancing this agenda are formidable, we recommend that governments define common standards for value-based accounting; serve as information brokers for evidence development; pioneer value-based procurement of goods and services; engage in deliberative democracy in cancer care; and educate communities to facilitate knowledge sharing between communities of patients, their caretakers, and researchers.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We did this by combining country- and individual-level data for the twenty-seven countries of the European Union, focusing on people's self-rated health status and whether or not they had severe limitations or untreated conditions. We found that people with chronic conditions were more likely to be in good or very good health in countries that had a stronger primary care structure and better coordination of care. People with more than two chronic conditions benefited most: Their self-rated health was higher if they lived in countries with a stronger primary care structure, better continuity of care, and a more comprehensive package of primary care services. In general, while having access to a strong primary care system mattered for people with chronic conditions, the degree to which it mattered differed across specific subgroups (for example, people with primary care-sensitive conditions) and primary care dimensions. Primary care reforms, therefore, should be person centered, addressing the needs of subgroups of patients while also finding a balance between structure and service delivery.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We discuss findings from Peers for Progress, a program of the American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation, to examine when peer support does not work, guide dissemination of peer support programs, and help integrate approaches such as e-health into peer support. Success factors for peer support programs include proactive implementation, attention to participants' emotions, and ongoing supervision. Reaching those whom conventional clinical and preventive services too often fail to reach; reaching whole populations, such as people with diabetes, rather than selected samples; and addressing behavioral health are strengths of peer support that can help achieve health care that is efficient and of high quality.

26355053,10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0514,Achieving Effective Universal Health Coverage And Diagonal Approaches To Care For Chronic Illnesses.,"Health systems in low- and middle-income countries were designed to provide episodic care for acute conditions. However, the burden of disease has shifted to be overwhelmingly dominated by chronic conditions and illnesses that require health systems to function in an integrated manner across a spectrum of disease stages from prevention to palliation. Low- and middle-income countries are also aiming to ensure health care access for all through universal health coverage. This article proposes a framework of effective universal health coverage intended to meet the challenge of chronic illnesses. It outlines strategies to strengthen health systems through a ""diagonal approach.""

Although the epidemiologic, demographic, and nutritional transitions are well under way in low-income countries, investment and attention in these countries remain focused largely on communicable diseases. We discuss existing infrastructure in communicable disease management as well as linkages between noncommunicable and communicable diseases in East Africa. We describe gaps in noncommunicable disease management within the health systems in this region. We also discuss deficiencies in addressing noncommunicable diseases from basic science research and medical training to health services delivery, public health initiatives, and access to essential medications in East Africa. Finally, we highlight the role of collaboration among East African governments and civil society in addressing noncommunicable diseases, and we advocate for a robust primary health care system that focuses on the social determinants of health.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015
26355051,10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0791,Integrating Mental Health In Care For Noncommunicable Diseases: An Imperative For Person-Centered Care.,"Mental disorders such as depression and alcohol use disorders often co-occur with other common noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Furthermore, noncommunicable diseases are frequently encountered in patients with severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia. The pathways underlying the comorbidity of mental disorders and noncommunicable diseases are complex. For example, mental and physical noncommunicable diseases may have common environmental risk factors such as unhealthy lifestyles, and treatments for one condition may have side effects that increase the risk of another condition. Building on the robust evidence base for effective treatments for a range of mental disorders, there is now a growing evidence base for how such treatments can be integrated into the care of people with noncommunicable diseases. The best-established delivery model is a team approach that features a nonspecialist case manager who coordinates care with primary care physicians and specialists. This approach maximizes efficiencies in person-centered care, which are essential for achieving universal health coverage for both noncommunicable diseases and mental disorders. A number of research gaps remain, but there is sufficient evidence for policy makers to immediately implement measures to integrate mental health and noncommunicable disease care in primary care platforms.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26355049,10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0361,Framing Progress In Global Tobacco Control To Inform Action On Noncommunicable Diseases.,"Much has been learned about the tobacco epidemic, including its consequences, effective measures to control it, and the actors involved. This article identifies lessons learned that are applicable to the other principal external causes of noncommunicable diseases: alcohol abuse, poor nutrition, and physical inactivity. Among these lessons are the development of evidence-based strategies such as proven cessation methods, tax increases, and smoke-free policies; the role of multinational corporations in maintaining markets and undermining control measures; and the need for strategies that reach across the life course and that begin with individuals and extend to higher levels of societal organization. Differences are also clear. Tobacco products are relatively homogeneous and have no direct benefit to consumers, whereas food and alcohol consumed in moderation are not inherently dangerous. Some tobacco-related diseases have the singular predominant cause of smoking, while many noncommunicable diseases have multiple interlocking causes such as poor diet, excess alcohol consumption, insufficient physical activity, and smoking, along with genetics. Thus, the tobacco control model of comprehensive multilevel strategies is applicable to the control of noncommunicable diseases, but the focus must be on multiple risk factors.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Most of it is directed to wealthier countries and focuses on the prevention of unhealthy lifestyles. Explanations for the current direction of noncommunicable disease aid include that these are diseases of affluence that benefit from substantial research and development into their treatment in high-income countries and are better addressed through domestic tax and policy measures to reduce risk-factor prevalence than through aid programs. This study assessed these justifications. First, we examined the relationships among premature adult mortality, defined as the probability that a person who has lived to the age of fifteen will die before the age of sixty from noncommunicable diseases; the major risk factors for these diseases; and country wealth. Second, we compared noncommunicable and communicable diseases prevalent in poor and wealthy countries alike, and their respective links to economic development. Last, we examined the respective roles that wealth and risk prevention have played in countries that achieved substantial reductions in premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases. Our results support greater investment in cost-effective noncommunicable disease preventive care and treatment in poorer countries and a higher priority for reducing key risk factors, particularly tobacco use.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

To provide a contemporary overview of the burdens caused by noncommunicable diseases, we compiled mortality data reported by authorities in forty-nine countries for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases; diabetes; chronic respiratory diseases; and lung, colon, breast, cervical, liver, and stomach cancers. From 1980 to 2012, on average across all countries, mortality for cardiovascular disease, stomach cancer, and cervical cancer declined, while mortality for diabetes, liver cancer, and female chronic respiratory disease and lung cancer increased. In contrast to the relatively steep cardiovascular and cancer mortality declines observed in high-income countries, mortality for cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease was flat in most low- and middle-income countries, which also experienced increasing breast and colon cancer mortality. These divergent mortality patterns likely reflect differences in timing and magnitude of risk exposures, health care, and policies to counteract the diseases. Improving both the coverage and the accuracy of mortality documentation in populous low- and middle-income countries is a priority, as is the need to rigorously evaluate societal-level interventions. Furthermore, given the complex, chronic, and progressive nature of noncommunicable diseases, policies and programs to prevent and control them need to be multifaceted and long-term, as returns on investment accrue with time.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In Pakistan, dengue has been endemic for decades in the southern port city of Karachi, but large epidemics in the northeast have emerged only since 2011. Pakistan is therefore representative of many countries on the verge of countrywide endemic dengue transmission, where prevention, surveillance, and preparedness are key priorities in previously dengue-free regions. We analyze spatially explicit dengue case data from a large outbreak in Pakistan in 2013 and compare the dynamics of the epidemic to an epidemiological model of dengue virus transmission based on climate and mobility data from ∼40 million mobile phone subscribers. We find that mobile phone-based mobility estimates predict the geographic spread and timing of epidemics in both recently epidemic and emerging locations. We combine transmission suitability maps with estimates of seasonal dengue virus importation to generate fine-scale dynamic risk maps with direct application to dengue containment and epidemic preparedness.",eng,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This is especially the case with regards to obligations relating to health financing. Bearing in mind that it is not possible to achieve justice in global health without achieving equity in health financing at both domestic and global levels, our aim is to show how fulfilling the obligation we propose will make it easy to achieve equity in health financing at both domestic and international levels.--NEW SECTION--Achieving equity in global health financing is a crucial step towards achieving justice in global health. Our general view is that current discussions on global health equity largely ignore obligations of Low Income Country (LIC) governments and we recommend that these obligations should be mainstreamed in current discussions. While we recognise that various obligations need to be fulfilled in order to ultimately achieve justice in global health, for lack of space we prioritise obligations for health financing. Basing on the evidence that in most LICs health is not given priority in annual budget allocations, we propose that LIC governments should bear an obligation to allocate a certain minimum percent of their annual domestic budget resources to health, while they await external resources to supplement domestic ones. We recommend and demonstrate a mechanism for coordinating this obligation so that if the resulting obligations are fulfilled by both LIC and HIC governments it will be easy to achieve equity in global health financing. Although achieving justice in global health will depend on fulfillment of different categories of obligations, ensuring inter- and intra-country equity in health financing is pivotal. This can be achieved by requiring all LIC governments to allocate a certain optimal per cent of their domestic budget resources to health while they await external resources to top up in order to cover the whole cost of the minimum health opportunities for LIC citizens.",eng,BMC medical ethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26348711,10.1089/omi.2015.0047,HIV-1 Disease Progression and Survival in an Adult Population in Zimbabwe: Is There an Effect of the Mannose Binding Lectin Deficiency?,"HIV infection remains a major global health burden since its discovery in 1983. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region hardest hit by the HIV/AIDS pandemic where 63% of the 33 million infected people live. While there is marked person-to-person variability in susceptibility, progression, and survival with HIV infection, there is a paucity of predictive diagnostics associated with these clinical endpoints. In this regard, the deficiency in plasma Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL) is a common opsonic defect reported to increase susceptibility infections, including HIV. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the first study on the putative role of MBL deficiency on HIV progression and survival in an African adult population. We hypothesized that MBL deficiency has a role to play in HIV infection by increasing HIV disease progression and decreasing survival. We assessed the role of MBL deficiency on HIV disease progression and survival in a Zimbabwean adult population enrolled in the Mupfure Schistosomiasis and HIV (MUSH) cohort. We analyzed blood samples for MBL levels, MBL2 genotypes, HIV-1 status, viral load, and CD4(+) T cell counts. Participants were followed for 3 years wherein the endpoints were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Disease progression was measured as the rate of decline in CD4(+) T cell counts and the rate of increase in HIV viral load. We assessed 197 HIV positive adults where 83% (164) were women with a median age of 31 years. Prevalence of plasma MBL deficiency (less than 100 μg/L) and MBL2 deficient genetic variants (A/O and O/O genotypes) was 21% (42 out of 197) and 39% (74 out of 190), respectively. We did not observe a significant role to explain individual variation in mortality, change of CD4(+) T cell count, and viral load by MBL plasma deficiency or MBL2 genetic variants from baseline to 3 years follow up period in this adult population. We suggest the need for global OMICS research and that the present findings attest to the large between-population variability in a host of factors that can predispose individuals susceptible to HIV progression and mortality. We therefore cannot recommend at this time the use of plasma MBL levels or MBL2 genetic variants as a prognostic marker in HIV infection, disease progression, and survival in this adult population in Africa.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Nutrition Information Panel data for 23 sub-categories of packaged snack foods (n = 3481) were extracted from The George Institute for Global Health's 2013 branded food composition database. Variations in serving size and energy content per serving were examined. Energy contents per serving were compared to recommendations in the Australian Dietary Guidelines. Serving sizes varied within and between snack food categories. Mean energy content per serving varied from 320 kJ to 899 kJ. More energy per serving than the recommended 600 kJ was displayed by 22% (n = 539) of snack foods classified in the Australian Dietary Guidelines as discretionary foods. The recommendation for energy content per serving was exceeded in 60% (n = 635) of snack foods from the Five Food Groups. Only 37% (n = 377) of confectionery products displayed the industry-agreed serving size of 25 g. Energy content per serving of many packaged snack foods do not align with the Australian Dietary Guidelines and the industry agreed serving size has not been taken up widely within the confectionery category. Given the inconsistencies in serving sizes, featuring serving size in front-of-pack information may hinder the objective of a clear and simple nutrition message.

Virtual interactive presence and augmented reality (VIPAR), an iPad-based tool, allows surgeons to provide long-distance, virtual assistance wherever a wireless internet connection is available. Local and remote surgeons view a composite image of video feeds at each station, allowing for intraoperative telecollaboration in real time.--NEW SECTION--Local and remote stations were established in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and Birmingham, Alabama, as part of ongoing neurosurgical collaboration. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus coagulation with VIPAR was used for subjective and objective evaluation of system performance.--NEW SECTION--VIPAR allowed both surgeons to engage in complex visual and verbal communication during the procedure. Analysis of 5 video clips revealed video delay of 237 milliseconds (range, 93-391 milliseconds) relative to the audio signal. Excellent image resolution allowed the remote neurosurgeon to visualize all critical anatomy. The remote neurosurgeon could gesture to structures with no detectable difference in accuracy between stations, allowing for submillimeter precision. Fifteen endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus coagulation procedures have been performed with the use of VIPAR between Vietnam and the United States, with no significant complications. 80% of these patients remain shunt-free.--NEW SECTION--Evolving technologies that allow long-distance, intraoperative guidance, and knowledge transfer hold great potential for highly efficient international neurosurgical education. VIPAR is one example of an inexpensive, scalable platform for increasing global neurosurgical capacity.

Each pathogen can exacerbate the effects of the other and affect treatment outcomes. Understanding the within-host dynamics of these coinfecting pathogens is crucial, particularly in light of new, direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for HCV treatment that are becoming available.--NEW SECTION--In this study, we construct a within-host mathematical model of HCV/HIV coinfection by adapting a previously published model of HCV monoinfection to include an immune system component in infection clearance. We explore the effect of HIV-coinfection on spontaneous HCV clearance and sustained virologic response (SVR) by building in decreased immune function with increased HIV viral load. Treatment is modeled by modifying HCV burst-size, and we use clinically-relevant parameter estimates. Our model replicates real-world patient outcomes; it outputs infected and uninfected target cell counts, and HCV viral load for varying treatment and coinfection scenarios. Increased HIV viral load and reduced CD4(+) count correlate with decreased spontaneous clearance and SVR chances. Treatment efficacy/duration combinations resulting in SVR are calculated for HIV-positive and negative patients, and crucially, we replicate the new findings that highly efficacious DAAs reduce treatment differences between HIV-positive and negative patients. However, we also find that if drug efficacy decays sufficiently over treatment course, SVR differences between HIV-positive and negative patients reappear.--NEW SECTION--Our model shows theoretical evidence of the differing outcomes of HCV infection in cases where the immune system is compromised by HIV. Understanding what controls these outcomes is especially important with the advent of efficacious but often prohibitively expensive DAAs. Using a model to predict patient response can lend insight into optimal treatment design, both in helping to identify patients who might respond well to treatment and in helping to identify treatment pathways and pitfalls.",eng,Epidemics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The prognostic value of PROs in patients with isolated liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) who undergo surgery is unclear. In this study we investigated whether baseline PROs are prognostic in this patient group.--NEW SECTION--From April 2004 to May 2007, consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of CRC liver metastases completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-LMC21 questionnaires before surgery. Patients were followed until death or data were censored on April 9, 2012. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the effect of PROs on survival controlling for predefined clinical covariates. Models were simplified using a backwards stepwise approach and model utility appraised using the Harrell C and Somers D statistics and bootstrap methods.--NEW SECTION--Two hundred thirty-two patients underwent liver resection and 101 (43.5%) survived 5 years. Multivariate analysis controlling for relevant clinical covariates showed that a 10-point improvement in baseline global quality of life scores was associated with a 54% improvement in survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.63; P < .001), and a clinically significant weight loss was associated with 75% worse survival (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.20-2.55; P = .004). Smaller effects were noted for worsening abdominal pain, taste problems, and fatigue (30%-38% poorer survival). Results of bootstrap resampling suggested that global health and weight loss most reliably predicted survival.--NEW SECTION--Results of this study demonstrated that patients who reported worse baseline global quality of life and increased weight loss before liver resection for CRC liver metastases had significantly poorer survival.

ESCC is the dominant histology globally but represents a minority of U.S. cases, with EAC accounting for the majority of U.S.--NEW SECTION--The patient outcomes for advanced ESCC and EAC are poor, and new therapeutic options are needed. Using a sensitive sequencing assay, we compared the genomic profiles of ESCC and EAC with attention to identification of therapeutically relevant genomic alterations.--NEW SECTION--Next-generation sequencing-based comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation-based libraries to a median coverage depth of >650× for all coding exons of 315 cancer-related genes plus selected introns from 28 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Results from a single sample were evaluated for all classes of genomic alterations (GAs) including point mutations, short insertions and deletions, gene amplifications, homozygous deletions, and fusions/rearrangements. Clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGAs) were defined as alterations linked to approved drugs and those under evaluation in mechanism-driven clinical trials.--NEW SECTION--There were no significant differences by sex for either tumor type, and the median age for all patients was 63 years. All ESCCs and EACs were at an advanced stage at the time of sequencing. All 71 ESCCs and 231 EACs featured GAs on profiling, with 522 GAs in ESCC (7.4 per sample) and 1,303 GAs in EAC (5.6 per sample). The frequency of clinically relevant GAs in ESCC was 94% (2.6 per sample) and 93% in EAC (2.7 per sample). CRGAs occurring more frequently in EAC included KRAS (23% EAC vs. 6% ESCC) and ERBB2 (23% EAC vs. 3% ESCC). ESCC samples were enriched for CRGA in PIK3CA (24% ESCC vs. 10% EAC), PTEN (11% ESCC vs. 4% EAC), and NOTCH1 (17% ESCC vs. 3% EAC).

26333840,10.1534/g3.115.021808,"Genomic Correlates of Virulence Attenuation in the Deadly Amphibian Chytrid Fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis.","Emerging infectious diseasespose a significant threat to global health, but predicting disease outcomes for particular species can be complicated when pathogen virulence varies across space, time, or hosts. The pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has caused worldwide declines in frog populations. Not only do Bd isolates from wild populations vary in virulence, but virulence shifts can occur over short timescales when Bd is maintained in the laboratory. We leveraged changes in Bd virulence over multiple generations of passage to better understand mechanisms of pathogen virulence. We conducted whole-genome resequencing of two samples of the same Bd isolate, differing only in passage history, to identify genomic processes associated with virulence attenuation. The isolate with shorter passage history (and greater virulence) had greater chromosome copy numbers than the isolate maintained in culture for longer, suggesting that virulence attenuation may be associated with loss of chromosome copies. Our results suggest that genomic processes proposed as mechanisms for rapid evolution in Bd are correlated with virulence attenuation in laboratory culture within a single lineage of Bd. Moreover, these genomic processes can occur over extremely short timescales. On a practical level, our results underscore the importance of immediately cryo-archiving new Bd isolates and using fresh isolates, rather than samples cultured in the laboratory for long periods, for laboratory infection experiments. Finally, when attempting to predict disease outcomes for this ecologically important pathogen, it is critical to consider existing variation in virulence among isolates and the potential for shifts in virulence over short timescales.",eng,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The objective of this review was to assess how, during and after humanitarian crises, different mechanisms and models of coordination between organizations, agencies and bodies providing or financing health services compare in terms of access to health services and health outcomes.--NEW SECTION--We registered a protocol for this review in PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews under number PROSPERO2014:CRD42014009267. Eligible studies included randomized and nonrandomized designs, process evaluations and qualitative methods. We electronically searched Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the WHO Global Health Library and websites of relevant organizations. We followed standard systematic review methodology for the selection, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.--NEW SECTION--Of 14,309 identified citations from databases and organizations' websites, we identified four eligible studies. Two studies used mixed-methods, one used quantitative methods, and one used qualitative methods. The available evidence suggests that information coordination between bodies providing health services in humanitarian crises settings may be effective in improving health systems inputs. There is additional evidence suggesting that management/directive coordination such as the cluster model may improve health system inputs in addition to access to health services. None of the included studies assessed coordination through common representation and framework coordination. The evidence was judged to be of very low quality.--NEW SECTION--This systematic review provides evidence of possible effectiveness of information coordination and management/directive coordination between organizations, agencies and bodies providing or financing health services in humanitarian crises.

Chronically infected people are at risk for progressive hepatic fibrosis and consequent cirrhosis. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) level in serum is a complementary marker for intrahepatic HBV DNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Sortilin-1 (SORT1) has been reported to be involved in the post-Golgi vesicle trafficking of Apo lipoproteins degradation pathways. This study was designed to evaluate the hepatic and serum expression of HBsAg and its association with hepatic SORT1 gene expression in patients with chronic HBV. Thirty chronic hepatitis B patients with histological examination results were enrolled in this study. Liver biopsies were analyzed for hepatic HBsAg and SORT1 gene expression by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), respectively. Twenty seven out of 30 (90%) liver biopsies had positive staining for HBsAg and showed a significant inverse association with hepatic SORT1 fold change gene expression (β = -0.5, P = 0.042). There was significant association between HBV DNA levels and HBsAg expression in hepatocyte or serum titer of HBsAg (r = 0.39, P = 0.029; r = 0.39, P = 0.032 respectively). Serum ALT was also correlated with hepatic activity index (HAI) score (β = 0.6, P = 0.001).

Medical schools are seeking innovative approaches to support global health learning. This pilot study evaluated e-learning versus peer-reviewed articles to improve conceptual knowledge of global health.--NEW SECTION--A mixed methods study using a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) and qualitative inquiry consisting of four post-intervention focus groups. Outcomes included pre/post knowledge quiz and self-assessment measures based on validated tools from a Global Health CanMEDS Competency Model. RCT results were analyzed using SPSS-21 and focus group transcripts coded using NVivo-9 and recoded using thematic analysis.--NEW SECTION--One hundred and sixty-one pre-clerkship medical students from three Canadian medical schools participated in 2012-2013: 59 completed all elements of the RCT, 24 participated in the focus groups. Overall, comparing pre to post results, both groups showed a significant increase in the mean knowledge (quiz) scores and for 5/7 self-assessed competencies (p < 0.05). These quantitative data were triangulated with the focus groups findings that revealed knowledge acquisition with both approaches. There was no statistically significant difference between the two approaches. Participants highlighted their preference for e-learning to introduce new global health knowledge and as a repository of resources. They also mentioned personal interest in global health, online convenience and integration into the curriculum as incentives to complete the e-learning. Beta version e-learning barriers included content overload and technical difficulties.--NEW SECTION--Both the e-learning and the peer reviewed PDF articles improved global health conceptual knowledge.

Fra-1 (FOSL1) plays important roles in oncogenesis in various malignancies. We investigated the expression of Fra-1 in gastric cancer (GC) tissues by qPCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot technologies. The results showed that Fra-1 was overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues compared with the adjacent non‑cancerous tissues. To explore the possible mechanism of Fra-1 in GC, we elucidated the effect of Fra-1 in the apoptosis and cell cycle of gastric cancer cells, AGS, and found that a considerable decrease in apoptotic cells and increase of S phase rate were observed for AGS cells with Fra-1 overexpession. We identified and confirmed that Fra-1 affected the expression level of CTTN and EZR in vitro through LC-MS/MS analyses and western blot technology. Furthermore, we found that Fra-1 was correlated with dysregulation PI3K/Akt and p53 signaling pathway in gastric cancer tissues in vitro. Moreover, we found that Fra-1 overexpression affected the expression of PI3K, Akt, MDM2 and p53 in vivo. In summary, our results suggest that Fra-1 is upregulated in gastric cancer tissues and plays its function by affecting the PI3K/Akt and p53 signaling pathway in gastric cancer.",eng,International journal of oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

There is growing interest in community-based delivery mechanisms to help accelerate progress. One promising approach is the use of a form of participatory mothers' groups, called Care Groups, for expanding coverage of key child survival interventions, an essential feature for achieving mortality impact.--NEW SECTION--In this study we evaluate the effectiveness of Care Group projects conducted in 5 countries in Africa and Asia in comparison to other United States Agency for International Development-funded child survival projects in terms of increasing coverage of key child survival interventions and reducing U5MR (estimated using the Lives Saved Tool, or LiST). Ten Care Group and nine non-Care Group projects were matched by country and year of program implementation.--NEW SECTION--In Care Group project areas, coverage increases were more than double those in non-Care Group project areas for key child survival interventions (p = 0.0007). The mean annual percent change in U5MR modelled in LiST for the Care Group and non-Care Group projects was -4.80% and -3.14%, respectively (p = 0.09).--NEW SECTION--Our findings suggest that Care Groups may provide a promising approach to significantly increase key child survival interventions and increase reductions in U5MR.

However, the mapping between influenza transmission in ferrets and in humans is unsubstantiated. We address this gap by compiling and analyzing 240 estimates of influenza transmission in ferrets and humans. We demonstrate that estimates of ferret secondary attack rate (SAR) explain 66% of the variation in human SAR estimates at the subtype level. Further analysis shows that ferret transmission experiments have potential to identify influenza viruses of concern for epidemic spread in humans, though small sample sizes and biological uncertainties prevent definitive classification of human transmissibility. Thus, ferret transmission experiments provide valid predictions of pandemic potential of novel influenza strains, though results should continue to be corroborated by targeted virological and epidemiological research.",eng,eLife,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

A major impediment to this shift is that most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not established adequate sustainable funding for health promotion and health infrastructure.--NEW SECTION--In this article, we analyze how Thailand, a middle-income country, created a mechanism for sustainable funding for health.--NEW SECTION--We analyzed the progression of tobacco control and health promotion policies over the past three decades within the wider political-economic and sociocultural context. We constructed a parallel longitudinal analysis of statistical data on one emerging priority - road accidents - to determine whether policy shifts resulted in reduced injuries, hospitalizations and deaths.--NEW SECTION--In Thailand, the convergence of priorities among national interest groups for sustainable health development created an opportunity to use domestic tax policy and to create a semi-autonomous foundation (ThaiHealth) to address a range of pressing health priorities, including programs that substantially reduced road accidents.--NEW SECTION--Thailand's strategic process to develop a domestic mechanism for sustainable funding for health may provide LMICs with a roadmap to address emerging health priorities, especially those caused by modernization and globalization.",eng,Global health action,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Insecticides are typically used to manage mosquito populations, but the evolution of insecticide resistance is limiting their effectiveness. Thus, identifying new molecular and physiological targets in mosquitoes is needed to facilitate insecticide discovery and development. Here we test the hypothesis that gap junctions are valid molecular and physiological targets for new insecticides. Gap junctions are intercellular channels that mediate direct communication between neighboring cells and consist of evolutionarily distinct proteins in vertebrate (connexins) and invertebrate (innexins) animals. We show that the injection of pharmacological inhibitors of gap junctions (i.e., carbenoxolone, meclofenamic acid, or mefloquine) into the hemolymph of adult female mosquitoes elicits dose-dependent toxic effects, with mefloquine showing the greatest potency. In contrast, when applied topically to the cuticle, carbenoxolone was the only inhibitor to exhibit full efficacy. In vivo urine excretion assays demonstrate that both carbenoxolone and mefloquine inhibit the diuretic output of adult female mosquitoes, suggesting inhibition of excretory functions as part of their mechanism of action. When added to the rearing water of 1st instar larvae, carbenoxolone and meclofenamic acid both elicit dose-dependent toxic effects, with meclofenamic acid showing the greatest potency. Injecting a double-stranded RNA cocktail against innexins into the hemolymph of adult female mosquitoes knock down whole-animal innexin mRNA expression and decreases survival of the mosquitoes. Taken together these data indicate that gap junctions may provide novel molecular and physiological targets for the development of insecticides.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Cervical cancer reviews were more likely to focus upon prevention and screening, while breast cancer reviews were more likely to focus upon treatment and survivorship. Few of the breast cancer reviews referenced research and data from LMICs themselves; cervical cancer reviews were more likely to do so.

The maximal marketed dose of the combination (14/10 mg daily) lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly more than either monotherapy, with a reduction in adverse effects (especially ankle edema), compared to amlodipine alone.--NEW SECTION--Substantial clinical trial experience with amlodipine or perindopril suggests that these two agents effectively lower blood pressure, and may reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. In the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, hypertensive subjects randomized to receive these two drugs (in sequence) had a significantly lower incidence of several types of clinical events, compared to those who received atenolol ± bendroflumethiazide. The new formulation of perindopril arginine protects its ethyl ester, without requiring physical separation from amlodipine in a single pill, and is less hydroscopic than perindopril erbumine.

The STI-related projects were identified and categorised by pathogen, disease and type of science along the research pipeline from preclinical to translational research.--NEW SECTION--We identified 7393 infection-related awards with total investment of GBP 3.5 billion. Of these, 1238 awards (16.7%) covering funding of GBP 719.1 million (20.5%) were for STI research. HIV as an STI received GBP 465 million across 719 studies; non-HIV STIs received GBP 139 million across 378 studies. The Medical Research Council provided greatest investment (GBP 193 million for HIV, GBP 45 million for non-HIV STIs).

26321650,10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00135-8,Permutations of time and place in tuberculosis.,"Tuberculosis remains a global health pandemic. The current depiction of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis life cycle proposes that airborne bacilli are inhaled and phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, resulting in the formation of a granuloma that ruptures into the airways to reinitiate the infectious cycle. However, this widely proposed model overlooks the fact, established 100 years ago, that the initial site of M tuberculosis implantation is in the lower zones of the lungs, whereas infectious cavitary pulmonary disease develops at the lung apices. The immunological events at these two pulmonary locations are different--cavitation only occurs in the apices and not in the bases. Yet the current conceptual model of tuberculosis renders the immunology of these two temporally and spatially separated events identical. One key consequence is that prevention of primary childhood tuberculosis at the lung bases is regarded as adequate immunological protection, but extensive evidence shows that greater immunity could predispose to immunopathology and transmission at the lung apex. A much greater understanding of time and place in the immunopathological mechanisms underlying human tuberculosis is needed before further pre-exposure vaccination trials can be done.",eng,The Lancet.

The GBD can be used to generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development.--NEW SECTION--We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age, sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of sociodemographic status, which we constructed from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years, and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable, country, and time.--NEW SECTION--Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6·2 years (95% UI 5·6-6·6), from 65·3 years (65·0-65·6) in 1990 to 71·5 years (71·0-71·9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5·4 years (4·9-5·8), from 56·9 years (54·5-59·1) to 62·3 years (59·7-64·8), total DALYs fell by 3·6% (0·3-7·4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100 000 people fell by 26·7% (24·6-29·1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas for non-communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back and neck pain, and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more than 50% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However, sociodemographic status explained less than 10% of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably, increased sociodemographic status was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries.--NEW SECTION--Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained relatively constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition--in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured change in disease burden--is useful, but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status. This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions.--NEW SECTION--Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Attempted suicide ideation was more common in males and in patients with previous attempts, and were also more related to sequels. Moreover, patients with an overdose were associated with psychiatric history and clinical toxicity.--NEW SECTION--Patients with any of the following characteristics; male, psychiatric history, a history of previous suicide attempts and/or clinical toxicity at the time of the visit in the emergency center, were more associated suicidal ideation before the attempt. Therefore, they had greater severity and risk repeating the attempt. They require a careful psychiatric evaluation and close monitoring.",spa,"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26319169,10.1016/j.bios.2015.08.040,Towards detection and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease at point-of-care.,"Ebola outbreak-2014 (mainly Zaire strain related Ebola virus) has been declared most widely spread deadly persistent epidemic due to unavailability of rapid diagnostic, detection, and therapeutics. Ebola virus disease (EVD), a severe viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome caused by Ebola virus (EBOV) is transmitted by direct contact with the body fluids of infected person and objects contaminated with virus or infected animals. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared EVD epidemic as public health emergency of international concern with severe global economic burden. At fatal EBOV infection stage, patients usually die before the antibody response. Currently, rapid blood tests to diagnose EBOV infection include the antigen or antibodies capture using ELISA and RNA detection using RT/Q-PCR within 3-10 days after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, few nanotechnology-based colorimetric and paper-based immunoassay methods have been recently reported to detect Ebola virus. Unfortunately, these methods are limited to laboratory only. As state-of-the art (SoA) diagnostics time to confirm Ebola infection, varies from 6h to about 3 days, it causes delay in therapeutic approaches. Thus developing a cost-effective, rapid, sensitive, and selective sensor to detect EVD at point-of-care (POC) is certainly worth exploring to establish rapid diagnostics to decide therapeutics. This review highlights SoA of Ebola diagnostics and also a call to develop rapid, selective and sensitive POC detection of EBOV for global health care. We propose that adopting miniaturized electrochemical EBOV immunosensing can detect virus level at pM concentration within ∼40min compared to 3 days of ELISA test at nM levels.",eng,Biosensors & bioelectronics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26318679,10.1093/heapol/czu046,A framework on the emergence and effectiveness of global health networks.,"Since 1990 mortality and morbidity decline has been more extensive for some conditions prevalent in low- and middle-income countries than for others. One reason may be differences in the effectiveness of global health networks, which have proliferated in recent years. Some may be more capable than others in attracting attention to a condition, in generating funding, in developing interventions and in convincing national governments to adopt policies. This article introduces a supplement on the emergence and effectiveness of global health networks. The supplement examines networks concerned with six global health problems: tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia, tobacco use, alcohol harm, maternal mortality and newborn deaths. This article presents a conceptual framework delineating factors that may shape why networks crystallize more easily surrounding some issues than others, and once formed, why some are better able than others to shape policy and public health outcomes. All supplement papers draw on this framework. The framework consists of 10 factors in three categories: (1) features of the networks and actors that comprise them, including leadership, governance arrangements, network composition and framing strategies; (2) conditions in the global policy environment, including potential allies and opponents, funding availability and global expectations concerning which issues should be prioritized; (3) and characteristics of the issue, including severity, tractability and affected groups. The article also explains the design of the project, which is grounded in comparison of networks surrounding three matched issues: TB and pneumonia, tobacco use and alcohol harm, and maternal and newborn survival. Despite similar burden and issue characteristics, there has been considerably greater policy traction for the first in each pair. The supplement articles aim to explain the role of networks in shaping these differences, and collectively represent the first comparative effort to understand the emergence and effectiveness of global health networks.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26318590,10.1177/0022034515602879,Global Economic Impact of Dental Diseases.,"Reporting the economic burden of oral diseases is important to evaluate the societal relevance of preventing and addressing oral diseases. In addition to treatment costs, there are indirect costs to consider, mainly in terms of productivity losses due to absenteeism from work. The purpose of the present study was to estimate the direct and indirect costs of dental diseases worldwide to approximate the global economic impact. Estimation of direct treatment costs was based on a systematic approach. For estimation of indirect costs, an approach suggested by the World Health Organization's Commission on Macroeconomics and Health was employed, which factored in 2010 values of gross domestic product per capita as provided by the International Monetary Fund and oral burden of disease estimates from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study. Direct treatment costs due to dental diseases worldwide were estimated at US$298 billion yearly, corresponding to an average of 4.6% of global health expenditure. Indirect costs due to dental diseases worldwide amounted to US$144 billion yearly, corresponding to economic losses within the range of the 10 most frequent global causes of death. Within the limitations of currently available data sources and methodologies, these findings suggest that the global economic impact of dental diseases amounted to US$442 billion in 2010. Improvements in population oral health may imply substantial economic benefits not only in terms of reduced treatment costs but also because of fewer productivity losses in the labor market.",eng,Journal of dental research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Airway inflammation in COPD involves the increased expression of inflammatory mediators such as CXCL-8 and IL-1β which are important mediators for neutrophil recruitment. Macrophages are an important source of these mediators in COPD. Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) and Befidobacterium breve (B. breve) attenuate the development of 'allergic asthma' in animals but their effects in COPD are unknown.--NEW SECTION--To determine the anti-inflammatory effects of L. rhamnosus and B. breve on CS and Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation.--NEW SECTION--We stimulated the human macrophage cell line THP-1 with CS extract in the presence and absence of L. rhamnosus and B. breve and measured the expression and release of inflammatory mediators by RT-qPCR and ELISA respectively. An activity assay and Western blotting were used to examine NF-κB activation.--NEW SECTION--Both L. rhamnosus and B. breve were efficiently phagocytized by human macrophages. L. rhamnosus and B. breve significantly suppressed the ability of CS to induce the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-23, TNFα, CXCL-8 and HMGB1 release (all p<0.05) in human THP-1 macrophages. Similar suppression of TLR4- and TLR9-induced CXCL8 expression was also observed (p<0.05). The effect of L. rhamnosus and B. breve on inflammatory mediator release was associated with the suppression of CS-induced NF-κB activation (p<0.05).--NEW SECTION--This data indicate that these probiotics may be useful anti-inflammatory agents in CS-associated disease such as COPD.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Aspergillus species are found worldwide in humans and in almost all domestic animals and birds as well as in many wild species, causing a wide range of diseases from localized infections to fatal disseminated diseases, as well as allergic responses to inhaled conidia. Some prevalent forms of animal aspergillosis are invasive fatal infections in sea fan corals, stonebrood mummification in honey bees, pulmonary and air sac infection in birds, mycotic abortion and mammary gland infections in cattle, guttural pouch mycoses in horses, sinonasal infections in dogs and cats, and invasive pulmonary and cerebral infections in marine mammals and nonhuman primates.

Worldwide, maternal mortality has decreased by 45% and under-five mortality has fallen by over 50% over the past two decades [1]. However, improvements have not been achieved evenly across all ages; since 1990, under-five mortality has declined by ∼5% annually, but the average decrease in neonatal mortality is only ∼3% per year. Against this background, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) convened a meeting in Berlin on January 29-30, 2015 of global health stakeholders, representing funders, academia, regulatory agencies, non-governmental organizations, vaccine manufacturers, and Ministries of Health from Africa and Asia. The topic of discussion was the potential of maternal immunization (MI) to achieve further improvements in under-five morbidity and mortality rates in children, and particularly neonates and young infants, through targeting infectious diseases that are not preventable by other interventions in these age groups. The meeting focused on effective and appropriately priced MI vaccines against influenza, pertussis, and tetanus, as well as against respiratory syncytial virus, and the group B Streptococcus, for which no licensed vaccines currently exist. The primary goals of the BMGF 2015 convening were to bring together the global stakeholders in vaccine development, policy and delivery together with the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) community, to get recognition that MI is a strategy shared between these groups and so encourage increased collaboration, and obtain alignment on the next steps toward achieving a significant health impact through implementation of a MI program.",eng,Vaccine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

By contrast with the declining rates of injury seen in high-income countries, low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are experiencing an increase in injury rates, largely due to increased motorisation in these countries. In this study, we report the out-of-pocket expenditure and financial risk protection from trauma care in a tertiary care hospital of India.--NEW SECTION--Patients who were admitted for at least one night in a tertiary care hospital of Chandigarh during a 1 month period from April 15, 2013, and May 15, 2013, were recruited. Data were collected for the type of injury, out-of-pocket expenditure, and mechanisms undertaken to cope up with the expenditure. Cases were followed up at 1 month, 2 months, and 12 months after discharge to collect information about out-of-pocket expenditure. Prevalence of catastrophic expenditure-ie, if it exceeded 30% of the patient's annual household income-and distress financing-ie, if borrowing (with or without interest) or selling of assets was used to cope with high out-of-pocket expenditure, were assessed among patients recruited. Assuming prevalence of catastrophic expenditure to be 22%, with a precision of 5·5% and 5% alpha error, the sample size was estimated to be 218.--NEW SECTION--227 patients were recruited, of whom 155 (68%) were followed up until 12 months. No significant differences were noted based on sociodemographic, injury, and hospitalisation characteristics between the patients who were followed up and those who were lost to follow-up. Average out-of-pocket expenditure per admission to hospital was US$388 (95% CI 332-441) and at 12 months after injury was US$1046 (871-1221). Mean out-of-pocket expenditure for road traffic injury cases at the time of hospitalisation was US$400 (95% CI 344-456) and for non-road traffic injury cases was US$369 (313-425).

Within the field of surgery, this sector has made notable service contributions in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where access to surgical care is poor. Little is known about financing and funding flows to surgical care in LMICs from both domestic and international sources. Because an estimated 55% of surgical care delivered in LMICs is via charitable organisations, understanding the financial contributions of this sector could provide valuable insight into estimating funding flows and understanding financing priorities in global surgery.--NEW SECTION--Between June, and September, 2014, we searched public online databases of registered charitable organisations in five high-income nations (the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) to identify organisations committed exclusively to surgical needs. Based on availability, the most current 5 years (2007-13) of financial data per organisation were collected. For each charitable organisation, we identified the type of surgical services provided. We examined revenues and expenditures for each organisation.--NEW SECTION--160 organisations representing 15 different surgical specialties were included in the analysis. Total aggregated revenue over the years 2008-2013 was US$3·3 billion. Total aggregated expenses for all 160 organisations amounted to US$3·0 billion. 28 ophthalmology organisations accounted for 45% of revenue and 49% of expenses. 15 cleft lip and palate organisations totalled 26% of both revenue and expenses. 19 organisations providing a mix of diverse surgical specialty services amounted to 14% of revenue and 16% of expenses. The remaining 15% of funds represented 12 specialties and 98 organisations. The US accounted for 77·7% of revenue and 80·8% of expenses. The UK accounted for 11·0% of revenue and 11·91% of expenses. Canada accounted for 1·85% of revenue and 2·01% of expenses. Australia and New Zealand accounted for 4·94% of revenue and 5·29% of expenses.--NEW SECTION--Charitable organisations addressing surgical conditions primarily focus on elective surgical care and cover a broad range of subspecialties.

Although conditions amenable to surgery account for 28% of the global burden of disease, the external funds directed towards global surgical delivery, capacity building, and research are currently unknown and presumed to be low. We aimed to describe external funds given to these efforts from the USA, the world's largest donor nation.--NEW SECTION--We searched the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), National Institute of Health (NIH), Foundation Center, and registered US charitable organisations databases for financial data on any giving exclusively to surgical care in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). All nominal dollars were adjusted for inflation by converting to 2014 US dollars.--NEW SECTION--After adjustment for inflation, 22 NIH funded projects (totalling US$31·3 million, 1991-2014) were identified; 78·9% for trauma and injury, 12·5% for general surgery, and 8·6% for ophthalmology. Six relevant USAID projects were identified; all related to obstetric fistula care totalling US$438 million (2006-13). US$105 million (2003-13) was given to universities and charitable organisations by US foundations for 14 different surgical specialties (ophthalmology, cleft lip/palate, multidisciplinary teams, orthopaedics, cardiac, paediatric, reconstructive, obstetric fistula, neurosurgery, burn, general surgery, obstetric emergency procedures, anaesthesia, and unspecified specialty). 95 US charitable organisations representing 14 specialties (ophthalmology, cleft lip/palate, multidisciplinary teams, orthopaedics, cardiac, paediatric, reconstructive, obstetric fistula, neurosurgery, urology, ENT, craniofacial, burn, and general surgery) totalled revenue of US$2·67 billion and expenditure of US$2·5 billion (2007-13).--NEW SECTION--A strong surgical system is an indispensable part of any health system and requires financial investment. Tracking funds targeting surgery helps not only to quantify and clarify this investment, but also to ultimately serve as a platform to integrate surgical spending within health system strengthening. Although USAID is a vital foreign aid service and the NIH is a leader in biomedical and health research, their surgical scopes are restricted both financially (less than 1% of respective total budgets over the study years) and in surgical specialty. By contrast, the private charitable sector has contributed more financially and to more specialties. Still, current financial global health databases do not have precise data for surgery. To improve population health in LMICs, more resources should be dedicated to surgical system strengthening.

We extracted the following data: a brief description of the programme, years of training required, year after medical school graduation when training begins, name of national oversight organisation(s), in-country opportunities for subspecialty training, and whether programmes self-identified as being similar to or affected by the surgical education system in the USA or the UK.--NEW SECTION--We identified 5229 abstracts (3888 from Medline, 971 from EMBASE, and 726 from the Global Health Library databases). 228 (4·4%) articles underwent full text review. 60 articles were included for data extraction. We identified descriptions of general surgery training programmes in 52 countries. Data from an additional 17 countries represented by a regional college of surgeons were also recorded. Training duration ranged from 2-8 years (median total training, 6 years; median surgical training, 5 years), and lasted on average 6 years after medical school graduation. 19 countries self-identified as being similar to or affected by the US or UK training model. Many low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are working to expand access to surgical care through programmes, often focusing on training non-physician clinicians. Programmes in high-income countries have also undergone substantial reforms, affected by evolving practice environments, trainee preferences, and training bottlenecks.--NEW SECTION--General surgery training programmes are often responsive to national health care needs. We show a global trend towards standardisation of curricula and competency-based training. Countries expanding or developing their programmes show benefit from association or partnership with larger surgical organisations and academic institutions, but there are questions of sustainability. Both LMICs and high-income countries stand to benefit from coordinating development of global training standards and educational exchanges.

We have previously shown that up to a country-level caesarean delivery rate (CDRs) of roughly 19·0%, cesarean delivery rates and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and neonatal mortality rate (NMR) were inversely correlated. We investigated the absolute reductions in maternal and neonatal deaths if countries with low CDR increased their rates to a range of greater than 7·2% but less than or equal to 19·1%.--NEW SECTION--We calculated maternal and neonatal deaths in 2013 and 2012, respectively, for countries with CDR 7·2% or less (N=45) with available data from the World Bank Development Indicators. We modelled the expected reduction in deaths in these countries if they had the 25th and 75th MMR and NMR percentiles observed for countries (N=48) with CDRs ranging from greater than 7·2% but less than or equal to 19·1%. This model assumes that if countries with low CDRs increased their rates of caesarean delivery to greater than 7·2% but less than or equal to 19·1%, they would achieve levels of MMR and NMR observed in countries with those CDRs.--NEW SECTION--We estimate 176 078 (95% CI 163 258-188 898) maternal and 1 117 257 (95% CI 1 033 611-1 200 902) neonatal deaths occurred in 45 countries with low CDRs in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

We aimed to link use of national hospital service with national epidemiological surveillance data to describe the use of surgical procedures in the management of a broad spectrum of conditions.--NEW SECTION--We compiled Australian Modification-International Classification of Diseases-10 codes from the New Zealand National Minimum Dataset, 2008-11. Using primary cause of admission, we aggregated admissions to 91 hospitals into 119 disease states and 22 disease subcategories of the WHO Global Health Estimate (GHE). We queried each admission for any surgical procedure in a binary manner to determine the frequency of admitted patients whose care required surgery. Surgical procedures were defined as requiring general or neuroaxial anaesthesia. We then divided the volume of surgical cases by counts of disease prevalence from the GBD 2010 to determine surgical incidence. This study was approved by the University of Otago Human Ethics Committee (Health; Reference Number HD14/42). Raw data was only handled by coauthors with direct affiliation with the New Zealand Ministry of Health.--NEW SECTION--Between 2008 and 2011, there were 1 108 653 hospital admissions with 275 570 associated surgical procedures per year. Surgical procedures were associated with admissions for all 22 GHE disease subcategories and 116 of 119 GHE disease states (excluding intestinal nematode infections, iodine deficiency, and vitamin A deficiency). The subcategories with the largest surgical case volumes were unintentional injuries (48 073), musculoskeletal diseases (38 030), and digestive diseases (27 640), and the subcategories with the smallest surgical case volumes were nutritional deficiencies (13), neonatal conditions (204), and infectious and parasitic diseases (982). Surgical incidence ranged widely by individual disease states with the highest in other neurological conditions, abortion, appendicitis, obstructed labour, and maternal sepsis.--NEW SECTION--This study confirms previous research that surgical care is required across the entire spectrum of GHE disease subcategories, showing the crucial role of operative intervention in health systems.

Without dedicated public health interventions, fatal injuries will rise 40% and become the 4th leading cause of death by 2030, with the burden highest in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of traumatic injuries and injury-related deaths in low-resource countries worldwide, using population-based data from the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS), a validated survey tool.--NEW SECTION--Using data from three resource-poor countries (Nepal, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone), a weighted average of injury prevalence and deaths due to injury was calculated and extrapolated to low-resource countries worldwide. Injuries were defined as wounds from road traffic injuries (bus, car, truck, pedestrian, and bicycle), gunshot or stab or slash wounds, falls, work or home incidents, and burns. The Nepal study included a visual physical examination that confirmed the validity of the self-reported data. Population and annual health expenditure per capita data were obtained from the World Bank. Low-resource countries were defined as those with an annual per capita health expenditure of US$100 or less.--NEW SECTION--The overall prevalence of lifetime injury for these three countries was 18·03% (95% CI 18·02-18·04); 11·64% (95% CI 11·53-11·75) of deaths annually were due to injury. An estimated prevalence of lifetime injuries for the total population in 48 low-resource countries is 465·7 million people; about 2·6 million fatal injuries occur in these countries annually.--NEW SECTION--The limitations of this observational study with self-reported data include possible recall and desirability bias. About 466 million people at a community level (18%) sustain at least one injury during their lifetime and 2·6 million people die annually from trauma in the world's poorest countries.

The Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) is a population-based cluster survey previously used in Nepal, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone.--NEW SECTION--Using previously published SOSAS data from three resource-poor countries (Nepal, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone), a weighted average of overall prevalence of surgically treatable conditions was estimated and the number of deaths that could have been avoided by providing access to surgical care was calculated for the broader community of low-resource countries. Such conditions included, but were not limited to, injuries (road traffic incidents, falls, burns, and gunshot or stab wounds), masses (solid or soft, reducible), deformities (congenital or acquired), abdominal distention, and obstructed delivery. Population and health expenditure per capita data were obtained from the World Bank. Low-resource countries were defined as those with a per capita health expenditure of US$100 or less annually. The overall prevalence estimate from the previously published SOSAS data was extrapolated to each low-resource country. Using crude death rates for each country and the calculated proportion of avoidable deaths, a total number of deaths possibly averted in the previous year with access to appropriate surgical care was calculated.--NEW SECTION--The overall prevalence of surgically treatable conditions was 11·16% (95% CI 11·15-11·17) and 25·6% (95% CI 25·4-25·7) of deaths were potentially avoidable by providing access to surgical care. Using these percentages for the 48 low-resource countries, an estimated 288·2 million people are living with a surgically treatable condition and 5·6 million deaths could be averted annually by the provision of surgical care. In the Nepal SOSAS study, the observed agreement between self-reported verbal responses and visual physical examination findings was 94·6%. Such high correlation helps to validate the SOSAS tool.--NEW SECTION--Hundreds of millions of people with surgically treatable conditions live in low-resource countries, and about 25% of the mortality annually could be avoided with better access to surgical care.

Cross-reactive and non-neutralizing antibodies enhance viral infection, thereby exacerbating the disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Studying the epitopes targeted by these enhancing antibodies would improve the immune responses against DENV infection. In order to investigate the roles of antibodies in the pathogenesis of dengue, we generated a panel of 16 new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against DENV4. Using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), we examined the neutralizing activity of these mAbs. Furthermore, we used the in vitro and in vivo ADE assay to evaluate the enhancement of DENV infection by mAbs. The results indicate that the cross-reactive and poorly neutralizing mAbs, DD11-4 and DD18-5, strongly enhance DENV1-4 infection of K562 cells and increase mortality in AG129 mice. The epitope residues of these enhancing mAbs were identified using virus-like particle (VLP) mutants. W212 and E26 are the epitope residues of DD11-4 and DD18-5, respectively. In conclusion, we generated and characterized 16 new mAbs against DENV4. DD11-4 and D18-5 possessed non-neutralizing activities and enhanced viral infection. Moreover, we identified the epitope residues of enhancing mAbs on envelope protein.

Various disciplines have defined global health competencies (GHC) for their areas of professional practice. However, physiotherapist educators have not delineated GHC for physiotherapist education. This study's purpose was to develop GHC for United States (US)-based physiotherapist education.--NEW SECTION--We developed an online survey using 30 GHC from a nursing study and 4 GHC that we developed. We recruited physiotherapists who were clinicians and/or faculty employed in the US, or who had been employed as clinicians and/or faculty in the US within the past 5 years to complete the survey. We examined descriptive data for Likert responses and used content analysis for analysis of open-ended responses. The University of Texas at El Paso Institutional Review Board granted exempt status for the study.--NEW SECTION--One hundred eighty-eight participants completed the survey. A majority agreed or strongly agreed that 33 of the total 34 GHC were relevant to physiotherapist education. Four major categories emerged from open-ended responses: beyond entry level, greater relevance to physiotherapy, emphasis on US concerns, and value of understanding international issues and perspectives.--NEW SECTION--Although most participants agreed with the GHC, open-ended responses indicated the need for revision of the GHC to make them more relevant to entry-level physiotherapist education. We plan to revise the GHC and then validate the modified GHC through a future Delphi study. Study limitations include the limited number of participants and that the lack of an operational definition of 'global health' may have created confusion.--NEW SECTION--The study's results may inform physiotherapist educators inside and outside of the US as they contend with determining how to most effectively prepare physiotherapist students for competent practice in a globalized world.

We assessed the impact of smoking on life expectancy worldwide between 1980 and 2010.--NEW SECTION--We retrieved cause-specific mortality data from the WHO Mortality Database by sex, year and age for 63 countries with high or moderate quality data (1980-2010). Using the time of the peak of the smoking epidemic by country, relative risks from the three waves of the Cancer Prevention Study were applied to calculate the smoking impact ratio and population attributable fraction. Finally, we estimated the potential gain in life expectancy at age 40 if smoking-related deaths in middle age (40-79 years) were eliminated.--NEW SECTION--Currently, tobacco smoking is related to approximately 20% of total adult mortality in the countries in this study (24% in men and 12% in women). If smoking-related deaths were eliminated, adult life expectancy would increase on average by 2.4 years in men (0.1 in Uzbekistan to 4.8 years in Hungary) and 1 year in women (0.1 in Kyrgyzstan to 2.9 years in the USA). The proportion of smoking-related mortality among men has declined in most countries, but has increased in the most populous country in the world, that is, China from 4.6% to 7.3%. Increases in the impact of tobacco on life expectancy were observed among women in high-income countries.--NEW SECTION--Recent trends indicate a substantial rise in the population-level impact of tobacco smoking on life expectancy in women and in middle-income countries.

Drawing on qualitative, ethnographic research with indigenous women and health workers, the paper demonstrates that women experience poor-quality HIV education and counselling, and that indigenous practices and concerns are largely not addressed by HIV services. We attribute this to a combination of national anti-indigenous and anti-separatist political concerns with donor-led interventions that result in limited localisation and reduced effectiveness of HIV prevention measures. In West Papua, services are needed that enhance cooperation and shared commitment, and that acknowledge and work to overcome existing inequalities, ethnic tensions and discrimination in the health system. Beyond Indonesia, donor-led HIV programmes and interventions need to balance avoidance of politically sensitive issues with complicity in perpetuating health inequalities. Translating global health interventions and donor priorities into locally compelling HIV prevention activities involves more than navigating local cultural and religious beliefs. Programme development and implementation strategies that entail confronting structural questions as well as social hierarchies, cleavages and silences are needed to render more effective services; strategies that are inherently political.",eng,"Culture, health & sexuality",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In this paper, a cost effective, optical cell-phone based transmission polarized light microscope system is presented for imaging the malaria pigment known as hemozoin. It can be difficult to determine the presence of the pigment from background and other artifacts, even for skilled microscopy technicians. The pigment is much easier to observe using polarized light microscopy. However, implementation of polarized light microscopy lacks widespread adoption because the existing commercial devices have complicated designs, require sophisticated maintenance, tend to be bulky, can be expensive, and would require re-training for existing microscopy technicians. To this end, a high fidelity and high optical resolution cell-phone based polarized light microscopy system is presented which is comparable to larger bench-top polarized microscopy systems but at much lower cost and complexity. The detection of malaria in fixed and stained blood smears is presented using both, a conventional polarized microscope and our cell-phone based system. The cell-phone based polarimetric microscopy design shows the potential to have both the resolution and specificity to detect malaria in a low-cost, easy-to-use, modular platform.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26302338,10.1037/pha0000049,Boundary conditions of methamphetamine craving.,"Methamphetamine use has increased significantly and become a global health concern. Craving is known to predict methamphetamine use and relapse following abstinence. Some have suggested that cravings are automatic, generalized, and uncontrollable, but experimental work addressing these claims is lacking. In 2 exploratory studies, we tested the boundary conditions of methamphetamine craving by asking: (a) is craving specific to users' preferred route of administration?, and (b) can craving be regulated by cognitive strategies? Two groups of methamphetamine users were recruited. In Study 1, participants were grouped by their preferred route of administration (intranasal vs. smoking), and rated their craving in response to photographs and movies depicting methamphetamine use (via the intranasal vs. smoking route). In Study 2, methamphetamine smokers implemented cognitive regulation strategies while viewing photographs depicting methamphetamine smoking. Strategies involved either focusing on the positive aspects of smoking methamphetamine or the negative consequences of doing so-the latter strategy based on treatment protocols for addiction. In Study 1, we found a significant interaction between group and route of administration, such that participants who preferred to smoke methamphetamine reported significantly stronger craving for smoking stimuli, whereas those who preferred the intranasal route reported stronger craving for intranasal stimuli. In Study 2, participants reported significantly lower craving when focusing on the negative consequences associated with methamphetamine use. Taken together, these findings suggest that strength of craving for methamphetamine is moderated by users' route of administration and can be reduced by cognitive strategies. This has important theoretical, methodological, and clinical implications.",eng,Experimental and clinical psychopharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26301593,10.1371/journal.pone.0136708,Source and Purity of Dengue-Viral Preparations Impact Requirement for Enhancing Antibody to Induce Elevated IL-1β Secretion: A Primary Human Monocyte Model.,"Dengue virus is a major global health threat and can lead to life-threatening hemorrhagic complications due to immune activation and cytokine production. Cross-reactive antibodies to an earlier dengue virus infection are a recognized risk factor for severe disease. These antibodies bind heterologous dengue serotypes and enhance infection into Fc-receptor-bearing cells, a process known as antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. One crucial cytokine seen elevated in severe dengue patients is IL-1β, a potent inflammatory cytokine matured by the inflammasome. We used a highly-physiologic system by studying antibody-dependent enhancement of IL-1β in primary human monocytes with anti-dengue human monoclonal antibodies isolated from patients. Antibody-enhancement increased viral replication in primary human monocytes inoculated with supernatant harvested from Vero cells infected with dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) 16681. Surprisingly, IL-1β secretion induced by infectious supernatant harvested from two independent Vero cell lines was not enhanced by antibody. Secretion of multiple other inflammatory cytokines was also independent of antibody signaling. However, IL-1β secretion did require NLRP3 and caspase-1 activity. Immunodepletion of dengue virions from the infectious supernatant confirmed that virus was not the main IL-1β-inducing agent, suggesting that a supernatant component(s) not associated with the virion induced IL-1β production. We excluded RNA, DNA, contaminating LPS, viral NS1 protein, complement, and cytokines. In contrast, purified Vero-derived DENV-2 16681 exhibited antibody-enhancement of both infection and IL-1β induction. Furthermore, C6/36 mosquito cells did not produce such an inflammatory component, as crude supernatant harvested from insect cells infected with DENV-2 16681 induced antibody-dependent IL-1β secretion. This study indicates that Vero cells infected with DENV-2 16681 may produce inflammatory components during dengue virus propagation that mask the virus-specific immune response. Thus, the choice of host cell and viral purity should be carefully considered, while insect-derived virus represents a system that elicits antibody-dependent cytokine responses to dengue virus with fewer confounding issues.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

There are no reported studies regarding sexual violence among children in Jordan. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the problem of sexual violence among children in the Northern region of Jordan. A retrospective design was adopted to review all reports from the Forensic Medicine Teaching Center of North of Jordan clinic on cases of sexual-related assaults that occurred between 2003 and 2007. Reports were reviewed for age, gender, toxicological analysis, and relevant information provided by victims and their relatives. Results indicated that 53% of the cases were male victims, with a male to female ratio of 1:1. Ages ranged from 3 to 18 years with a mean age of 12.5 years. Most cases were considered indecent assaults, while 37.1% were cases of rape. In most cases, offenders were strangers. It could be concluded that Jordanian children are as susceptible to sexual assaults as their counterparts worldwide. This study is the first to report sexual offenses among children in Jordan.

The case-fatality rate associated with BSIs in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) reaches 35%-50%. The emergence and diffusion of bacteria with resistance to antibiotics is a global health problem. Multidrug-resistant bacteria were detected in 50.7% of patients with BSIs in a recently published international observational study, with methicillin resistance detected in 48% of Staphylococcus aureus strains, carbapenem resistance detected in 69% of Acinetobacter spp., in 38% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and in 37% of Pseudomonas spp. Prior hospitalization and antibiotic exposure have been identified as risk factors for infections caused by resistant bacteria in different studies. Patients with BSIs caused by resistant strains showed an increased risk of mortality, which may be explained by a higher incidence of inappropriate empirical therapy in different studies. The molecular genetic characterization of resistant bacteria allows the understanding of the most common mechanisms underlying their resistance and the adoption of surveillance measures. Knowledge of epidemiology, risk factors, mechanisms of resistance, and outcomes of BSIs caused by resistant bacteria may have a major influence on global management of ICU patients. The aim of this review is to provide the clinician an update on BSIs caused by resistant bacteria in ICU patients.",eng,Infection and drug resistance,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

While genetic components are also involved in its pathogenesis, in recent years, it has shown a critical role of the innate and adaptive immune cell response in many tissues triggered by excess of nutrients such as lipids and glucose. Free fatty acids and other nutrient-related signals induce damage such as insulin resistance in the peripheral tissues but also in the brain. Specifically in the hypothalamus, these metabolic signals can trigger significant changes in the control of energy balance. Recent studies have shown that saturated fat disrupts melanocortin signaling of hypothalamic neuronal subgroups pivotal to energy control. Bariatric surgery is a treatment option for obesity when other tools have failed, because it is more effective than pharmacotherapy concerning of weight loss itself and in improvement of obesity-related comorbidities.

Drivers for this disease vary by region and are not well understood for North African countries such as Egypt. A deeper understanding of RVF risk factors would inform disease management policies.--NEW SECTION--The present study employs mathematical and computational modeling techniques to ascertain the extent to which the severity of RVF epizootics in Egypt differs depending on the interaction between imported ruminant and environmentally-constrained mosquito populations.--NEW SECTION--An ordinary differential system of equations, a numerical model, and an individual-based model (IBM) were constructed to represent RVF disease dynamics between localized mosquitoes and ruminants being imported into Egypt for the Greater Bairam. Four cases, corresponding to the Greater Bairam's occurrence during distinct quarters of the solar year, were set up in both models to assess whether the different season-associated mosquito populations present during the Greater Bairam resulted in RVF epizootics of variable magnitudes.--NEW SECTION--The numerical model and the IBM produced nearly identical results: ruminant and mosquito population plots for both models were similar in shape and magnitude for all four cases. In both models, all four cases differed in the severity of their corresponding simulated RVF epizootics. The four cases, ranked by the severity of the simulated RVF epizootics in descending order, correspond with the occurrence of the Greater Bairam on the following months: July, October, April, and January. The numerical model was assessed for sensitivity with respect to parameter values and exhibited a high degree of robustness.--NEW SECTION--Limiting the importation of infected ruminants beginning one month prior to the Greater Bairam festival (on years in which the festival falls between the months of July and October: 2014-2022) might be a feasible way of mitigating future RVF epizootics in Egypt.",eng,Public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

26297673,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2015.08.005,Targeting oxidant-dependent mechanisms for the treatment of COPD and its comorbidities.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an incurable global health burden and is characterised by progressive airflow limitation and loss of lung function. In addition to the pulmonary impact of the disease, COPD patients often develop comorbid diseases such as cardiovascular disease, skeletal muscle wasting, lung cancer and osteoporosis. One key feature of COPD, yet often underappreciated, is the contribution of oxidative stress in the onset and development of the disease. Patients experience an increased burden of oxidative stress due to the combined effects of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) generation, antioxidant depletion and reduced antioxidant enzyme activity. Currently, there is a lack of effective treatments for COPD, and an even greater lack of research regarding interventions that treat both COPD and its comorbidities. Due to the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of COPD and many of its comorbidities, a unique therapeutic opportunity arises where the treatment of a multitude of diseases may be possible with only one therapeutic target. In this review, oxidative stress and the roles of ROS/RNS in the context of COPD and comorbid cardiovascular disease, skeletal muscle wasting, lung cancer, and osteoporosis are discussed and the potential for therapeutic benefit of anti-oxidative treatment in these conditions is outlined. Because of the unique interplay between oxidative stress and these diseases, oxidative stress represents a novel target for the treatment of COPD and its comorbidities.",eng,Pharmacology & therapeutics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The majority of preterm births occur in resource-poor countries including India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo where many die due to lack of basic skilled nursing care. In September 2000, the United Nations signed the Millennium Development Declaration establishing eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These MDGs provide specific, measurable targets that are designed to provide equitable health to all, particularly the most vulnerable including preterm babies. On May 2, 2014, the World Health Organization specifically targeted the nursing workforce as a key stakeholder in strategies to reduce global prematurity and end preventable preterm newborn deaths. Specific strategies include primary care, screening for risk factors, kangaroo mother care, and early initiation of breastfeeding with exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life.

In low- and middle-income countries, especially those emerging from violent conflict, research capacity often lags behind other aspects of health system development. Here, we sought to bibliometrically review health-related research output in Somaliland, a post-conflict self-declared, autonomous nation on the Horn of Africa, as a means of assessing research capacity.--NEW SECTION--We reviewed articles on health-related research conducted in Somaliland between 1991 and 2013 that included a description of the experimental design, and articles were published in either a peer-reviewed journal or as part of a scholarly programme receiving formal review. We did not include policy or social science research that did not enrol or interact with subjects from Somaliland. Using online databases, all studies meeting minimum eligibility criteria were reviewed in regard to Somaliland-based co-authorship, topic of research and specific measures of quality.--NEW SECTION--A total of 37 studies were included in this review. Of these, only 19 (51%) included co-authorship by Somaliland-based researchers. Of the 21 studies reporting ethical approval, 16 (64%) received approval from the Somalia or Somaliland Ministry of Health, while five received approval from a university or national commission. More than two-thirds of published research was limited to a few areas of investigation with most (19, 51%) following basic cross-sectional study designs. The number of articles published per year increased from 0 to 1 in the years 1991-2007 to a maximum of 8 in 2013.--NEW SECTION--Research activity in Somaliland is extremely limited. Investigators from high-income countries have largely directed the research agenda in Somaliland; only half of the included studies list co-authors from institutions in Somaliland. Leadership and governance of health research in Somaliland is required to define national priorities, promote scholarly activity and guide the responsible conduct of research. The methods used here to assess research capacity may be generalisable to other low- and middle-income countries and post-conflict settings to measure the impact of research capacity-building efforts.",eng,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26293004,10.1002/mds.26362,New treatments for levodopa-induced motor complications.,"Levodopa (l-dopa)-induced motor complications, including motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, affect almost all patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) at some point during the disease course, with relevant implications in global health status. Various dopaminergic and nondopaminergic pharmacological approaches as well as more invasive strategies including devices and functional surgery are available to manage such complications. In spite of undisputable improvements during the last decades, many patients remain significantly disabled, and a fully satisfying management of l-dopa-induced motor complications is still an important unmet need of PD therapy. This article reviews the recent trial results published from 2013 to April 2015 about pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions to treat motor complications. Randomized controlled trials conducted in patients suffering from already established complications showed that new levodopa (l-dopa) formulations such as intrajejunal l-dopa-carbidopa infusion and bilayered extended-release l-dopa-carbidopa (IPX066) can improve motor fluctuations. Positive results were also obtained with a new monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor (safinamide) and a catechol-O-methyltransferase COMT inhibitor (opicapone). Pilot data suggest that new formulations of dopamine agonists (inhaled apomorphine) are also of potential interest. The development of novel nondopaminergic adenosine A2A antagonists (istradefylline, preladenant, and tozadenant) to treat motor fluctuations showed conflicting results in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. For dyskinesia, trials with new amantadine extended-release formulations confirmed the interest of the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist approach. Positive pilot antidyskinetic effects were also recently reported using serotonin agents such as eltoprazine and glutamate mGluR5 modulators such as mavoglurant. However, the translation to clinical practice of such innovative concepts remains challenging, because subsequent phase 2 trials conducted to confirm the antidyskynetic effects of mavoglurant failed, leading to the interruption of the development of this compound for this indication.",eng,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This type of emergence poses a vital challenge to control TB cases across the world. Mortality and morbidity rates are high due to this new face of TB. The newer nanotechnology-based drug-delivery approaches involving micro-metric and nano-metric carriers are much needed at this stage. These delivery systems would provide more advantages over conventional systems of treatment by producing enhanced therapeutic efficacy, uniform distribution of drug molecule to the target site, sustained and controlled release of drug molecules and lesser side effects. The main aim to develop these novel drug-delivery systems is to improve the patient compliance and reduce therapy time. This article reviews and elaborates the new concepts and drug-delivery approaches for the treatment of TB involving solid-lipid particulate drug-delivery systems (solid-lipid micro- and nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers), vesicular drug-delivery systems (liposomes, niosomes and liposphere), emulsion-based drug-delivery systems (micro and nanoemulsion) and some other novel drug-delivery systems for the effective treatment of tuberculosis and role of immunomodulators as an adjuvant therapy for management of MDR-TB and XDR-TB.",eng,Drug delivery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Availability of safe blood transfusions, effective and accessible iron chelating medications, the introduction of new and non-invasive methods of tissue iron assessment and other advances in multidisciplinary care of thalassaemia patients have all contributed to better outcomes. This, however, may not be true for patients who are born in countries where the resources are limited. Unfortunately, transfusion-transmitted infections are still major concerns in these countries where paradoxically thalassaemia is most common. Moreover, oral iron chelators and MRI for monitoring of iron status may not be widely accessible or affordable, which may result in poor compliance and suboptimal iron chelation. All of these limitations will lead to reduced survival and increased thalassaemia-related complications and subsequently will affect the patient's quality of life. In countries with limited resources, together with improvement of clinical care, strategies to control the disease burden, such as public education, screening programmes and appropriate counselling, should be put in place. Much can be done to improve the situation by developing partnerships between developed countries and those with limited resources. Future research should also particularly focus on patient's quality of life as an important outcome of care.",eng,Archives of disease in childhood,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Notable members include West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Chikungunya, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus and enteroviruses of the Picornaviridae family.Unfortunately, prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against these pathogens are limited. +RNA viruses have limited coding capacity and thus rely extensively on host factors for successful infection and propagation. A common feature among these viruses is their ability to dramatically modify cellular membranes to serve as platforms for genome replication and assembly of new virions. These viral replication complexes (VRCs) serve two main functions: To increase replication efficiency by concentrating critical factors and to protect the viral genome from host anti-viral systems.

The survey was disseminated via international social networks used by patients with a tracheostomy and their families. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed.--NEW SECTION--Of 220 respondents, 90% cared for a pediatric patient with a tracheostomy. Only 48% of respondents felt ""very prepared"" at time of discharge, and 11% did not receive emergency preparedness training prior to discharge. Home nursing needs were inadequately met in 17% of families, with resulting difficulties shortly after discharge; 14% sought emergent care within 1 week of discharge. Nearly half of respondents indicated a desire to have met with a patient with a tracheostomy prior to surgery but were not offered that opportunity. Fragmented care or limited teamwork was reported by 32% of respondents, whereas tracheotomy care was described as ""integrated"" or ""maximally integrated"" for 67%.--NEW SECTION--While many families report satisfaction with tracheostomy care, opportunities remain for improving care.

26286613,10.4103/2249-4863.161305,Generic drugs: Review and experiences from South India.,"The cost of pharmaceuticals, as a percentage of total healthcare spending, has been rising worldwide. This has resulted in strained national budgets and a high proportion of people without access to essential medications. Though India has become a global hub of generic drug manufacturing, the expected benefits of cheaper drugs are not translating into savings for ordinary people. This is in part due to the rise of branded generics, which are marketed at a price point close to the innovator brands. Unbranded generic medicines are not finding their way into prescriptions due to issues of confidence and perception, though they are proven to be much cheaper and comparable in efficacy to branded medicines. The drug inventory of unbranded generic manufacturers fares reasonably when reviewed using the World Health Organization-Health Action International (WHO-HAI) tool for analysing drug availability. Also, unbranded generic medicines are much cheaper when compared to the most selling brands and they can bring down the treatment costs in primary care and family practice. We share our experience in running a community pharmacy for an urban health center in the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala State, which is run solely on generic medicines.

The present study examined the psychological, social, and physical health states in competitive swimmers engaged in long-term training.--NEW SECTION--The study took place during the 4 days of the French master championships in France in 2011 (from 10 to 13 March). Global health parameters were evaluated and compared with general values reported in studies aiming to describe health standard values in France or Europe. All swimmers selected for the event were invited to participate in the study. Setting questionnaires concerning mental and social health (short form 36), physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire), and medication were administered. Peak expiratory flow (l.min-1) was measured, and body mass index (kg.m-2) was calculated from height (m) and body mass (kg). Prevalence of overweight and obesity was calculated by age and gender. Chi-squared tests were used to compare prevalence of overweight and obesity between participants and reference values. Short form 36 scores and physical activity (met.h.week-1) were compared with reference values by single t-tests. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare peak flow results with standard values. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.--NEW SECTION--Out of 1554 master swimmers, 490 participated in this study (rates of participation = 44.8 and 23.5 % for females and males, respectively). Data showed inequality of health indexes as compared with reference values, despite a significantly higher level of physical activity including swimming activity. The prevalence of obesity was significantly lower (p < 0.05), and peak expiratory flow values were higher among female swimmers (from 7.6 to 17 % higher according to the age, p < 0.05). Perception of vitality was significantly higher for all female swimmers and the older age groups of male swimmers (p < 0.05). Perception of bodily pain indicated significantly lower scores for swimmers than the reference values (p < 0.05). Significantly lower prevalence of swimmers taking medication was noted in comparison with the French national values (p = 0.012).--NEW SECTION--Compared with reference data from various sources, master competitive swimmers used less medication, had lower rates of obesity in most age groups, had greater peak expiratory flow values suggesting improved lung function, had higher levels of total physical activity, and had more favorable scores for various subscales of the SF-36. The results argue in favor of competitive swimming for its positive effects on health outcomes.--NEW SECTION--French master swimmers involved in national championships have many positive health outcomes in terms of weight management, respiratory function, and vitality. However, the very high physical activity level in this competitive context did not result in significantly better levels on all parameters in comparison with their national counterparts (pain perception, social, emotional, and mental health).Positive health outcomes were higher for female master swimmers in terms of weight management, respiratory function, and vitality.The fact that these benefits were not linked with medication consumption could be interesting in an economic context aimed at controlling expenditures on health.

In the United States, around 1.2 million children suffer from abuse, while in LMICs, such as Brazil, these rates are much higher (an estimated 28 million children). Exposition to early environmental stress has been associated with suboptimal physical and brain development, persistent cognitive impairment, and behavioral problems. Studies have reported that children exposed to maltreatment are at high risk of behavioral problems, learning disabilities, communication and psychiatric disorders, and general clinical conditions, such as obesity and systemic inflammation later in life. The aim of this paper is to describe The Equilibrium Program (""TEP""), a community-based global health program implemented in São Paulo, Brazil to serve traumatized and neglected children and adolescents. We will describe and discuss TEP's implementation, highlighting its innovation aspects, research projects developed within the program as well as its population profile. Finally, we will discuss TEP's social impact, challenges, and limitations.

We conducted a case-control study of 49 pregnant women, 15 of whom delivered preterm. From 40 of these women, we analyzed bacterial taxonomic composition of 3,767 specimens collected prospectively and weekly during gestation and monthly after delivery from the vagina, distal gut, saliva, and tooth/gum. Linear mixed-effects modeling, medoid-based clustering, and Markov chain modeling were used to analyze community temporal trends, community structure, and vaginal community state transitions. Microbiota community taxonomic composition and diversity remained remarkably stable at all four body sites during pregnancy (P > 0.05 for trends over time). Prevalence of a Lactobacillus-poor vaginal community state type (CST 4) was inversely correlated with gestational age at delivery (P = 0.0039). Risk for preterm birth was more pronounced for subjects with CST 4 accompanied by elevated Gardnerella or Ureaplasma abundances. This finding was validated with a set of 246 vaginal specimens from nine women (four of whom delivered preterm). Most women experienced a postdelivery disturbance in the vaginal community characterized by a decrease in Lactobacillus species and an increase in diverse anaerobes such as Peptoniphilus, Prevotella, and Anaerococcus species. This disturbance was unrelated to gestational age at delivery and persisted for up to 1 y.

26282859,10.1093/heapol/czv035,The challenge of sustaining effectiveness over time: the case of the global network to stop tuberculosis.,"Where once global health decisions were largely the domain of national governments and the World Health Organization, today networks of international organizations, governments, private philanthropies and other entities are actively shaping public policy. However, there is still limited understanding of how global networks form, how they create institutions, how they promote and sustain collective action, and how they adapt to changes in the policy environment. Understanding these processes is crucial to understanding their effectiveness: whether and how global networks influence policy and public health outcomes. This study seeks to address these gaps through the examination of the global network to stop tuberculosis (TB) and the factors influencing its effectiveness over time. Drawing from ∼ 200 document sources and 16 interviews with key informants, we trace the development of the Global Partnership to Stop TB and its work over the past decade. We find that having a centralized core group and a strategic brand helped the network to coalesce around a primary intervention strategy, directly observed treatment short course. This strategy was created before the network was formalized, and helped bring in donors, ministries of health and other organizations committed to fighting TB-growing the network. Adaptations to this strategy, the creation of a consensus-based Global Plan, and the creation of a variety of participatory venues for discussion, helped to expand and sustain the network. Presently, however, tensions have become more apparent within the network as it struggles with changing internal political dynamics and the evolution of the disease. While centralization and stability helped to launch and grow the network, the institutionalization of governance and strategy may have constrained adaptation. Institutionalization and centralization may, therefore, facilitate short-term success for networks, but may end up complicating longer-term effectiveness.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

These practices include restriction of fluids, breast milk and/or food intake during diarrhea episodes, and incorrect use of modern medicines. We conducted a systematic review of English-language literature published since 1990 to assess the documented prevalence of these four harmful practices, and beliefs, motivations, and contextual factors associated with harmful practices in low- and middle-income countries.--NEW SECTION--We electronically searched PubMed, Embase, Ovid Global Health, and the WHO Global Health Library. Publications reporting the prevalence or substantive findings on beliefs, motivations, or context related to at least one of the four harmful practices were included, regardless of study design or representativeness of the sample population.--NEW SECTION--Of the 114 articles included in the review, 79 reported the prevalence of at least one harmful practice and 35 studies reported on beliefs, motivations, or context for harmful practices. Most studies relied on sub-national population samples and many were limited to small sample sizes. Study design, study population, and definition of harmful practices varied across studies. Reported prevalence of harmful practices varied greatly across study populations, and we were unable to identify clearly defined patterns across regions, countries, or time periods. Caregivers reported that diarrhea management practices were based on the advice of others (health workers, relatives, community members), as well as their own observations or understanding of the efficacy of certain treatments for diarrhea. Others reported following traditionally held beliefs on the causes and cures for specific diarrheal diseases.--NEW SECTION--Available evidence suggests that harmful practices in diarrhea treatment are common in some countries with a high burden of diarrhea-related mortality. These practices can reduce correct management of diarrheal disease in children and result in treatment failure, sustained nutritional deficits, and increased diarrhea mortality. The lack of consistency in sampling, measurement, and reporting identified in this literature review highlights the need to document harmful practices using standard methods of measurement and reporting for the continued reduction of diarrhea mortality.",eng,BMC public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Two reviewers independently selected papers for inclusion based on agreed inclusion criteria (n = 9 with 147 participants). Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. All papers reported a statistically significant result in patients who received an intervention which used pursuit eye movements, and this was reported both as a short-term (immediate) effect and as a sustained effect up to 8 weeks after treatment. These effects were also reported in comparison with interventions using saccadic eye movements. One study also reported increased neural activity in a number of brain regions following pursuit-based intervention. Overall, there is good evidence in support of pursuit intervention used in the rehabilitation of stroke and spatial neglect over and above traditional interventions based on saccadic eye movements. Future research should aim to increase sample sizes, provide information on statistical power, record accurate eye movement responses and use randomised designs to reduce selection bias.",eng,Translational stroke research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26279189,10.1016/j.cell.2015.07.043,Rational Design of an Epstein-Barr Virus Vaccine Targeting the Receptor-Binding Site.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) represents a major global health problem. Though it is associated with infectious mononucleosis and ∼200,000 cancers annually worldwide, a vaccine is not available. The major target of immunity is EBV glycoprotein 350/220 (gp350) that mediates attachment to B cells through complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21). Here, we created self-assembling nanoparticles that displayed different domains of gp350 in a symmetric array. By focusing presentation of the CR2-binding domain on nanoparticles, potent neutralizing antibodies were elicited in mice and non-human primates. The structurally designed nanoparticle vaccine increased neutralization 10- to 100-fold compared to soluble gp350 by targeting a functionally conserved site of vulnerability, improving vaccine-induced protection in a mouse model. This rational approach to EBV vaccine design elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses by arrayed presentation of a conserved viral entry domain, a strategy that can be applied to other viruses.",eng,Cell,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Prospective QoL assessment was completed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) and/or Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep, version 4) questionnaires at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Ten HCC patients with Child-Pugh B liver function were also treated.--NEW SECTION--The QLQ-C30 was available for 205 patients, and 196 completed the FACT-Hep. No difference in baseline QoL (P = .17) or overall survival (P = .088) was seen between the HCC, liver metastases, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients. Appetite loss and fatigue measured by the QLQ-C30 clinically and statistically worsened by 1 month after treatment but recovered by 3 months. At 3 and 12 months after treatment, respectively, the FACT-Hep score had improved relative to baseline in 13%/19%, worsened in 36%/27%, and remained stable in 51%/54%. Using the QLQ-C30 Global Health score, QoL improved in 16%/23%, worsened in 34%/39%, and remained stable in 50%/38% at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Median survival was 17.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.3-19.8 months). Higher baseline scores on both FACT-Hep and QLQ-C30 Global Health were associated with improved survival. Hazard ratios for death, per 10-unit decrease in QoL, were 0.90 (95% CI 0.83-0.98; P = .001) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.95; P = .001), respectively. Tumor size was inversely correlated with survival.--NEW SECTION--Liver SBRT temporarily worsens appetite and fatigue, but not overall QoL.

It affects all parts of the spine, but the hardest to treat is its cervical region. The cervical spine is most mobile, delicate and sensitive to any load. It requires special care in conservative treatment. To date the selection of effective therapeutic approaches has been controversial.--NEW SECTION--The aim of the study was to assess the progress of rehabilitation in patients with cervical radicular pain syndrome after using two different methods of treatment: HILT and spinal axial traction with the use of Saunders device.--NEW SECTION--The randomized study included 150 patients (81 women and 69 men, aged 24-67 years, mean age 45.5) divided into two groups of 75 patients each with characteristic symptoms of radicular pain. The measurement of the range of cervical spine movement of the cervical spine, visual analog scale for pain - VAS and a NDI questionnaire (Neck Disability Index - Polish version) - an indicator of functional disorders - were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the two different therapies.--NEW SECTION--The results obtained by Saunders method remained significantly higher than those obtained when HILT laser therapy was used for most of the examined parameters. A thorough analysis of the results showed greater analgesic efficacy, improved global mobility and reduced functional impairment in patients treated with Saunders method.--NEW SECTION--Both therapeutic methods manifest analgesic effect and a positive impact on the improvement of range of cervical spine movement in patients with radicular pain in this spine region.

28299143,10.4081/jphia.2015.484,Analysis of the Determinants of Low Cervical Cancer Screening Uptake Among Nigerian Women.,"Cervical cancer causes an estimated 266,000 deaths globally, 85% of which occurs in developing countries. It is a preventable disease, if detected and treated early via screen and treat, yet its burden is still huge in Nigeria. In 2012, 21.8% cases of cervical cancer and 20.3% deaths due to cervical cancer were recorded in Nigeria. This review, therefore, aims at indentifying the determinants of low cervical cancer screening in Nigeria in order to contribute in reducing the burden of the disease. Literature were obtained from Global Health, Popline and PubMed databases; WHO and other relevant websites using Eldis search engine; and from libraries in the University of Leeds and WHO in Geneva. Conceptual framework for analyzing the determinants of cervical cancer screening uptake among Nigerian women was formed by inserting service delivery component of the WHO health system framework into a modified Health Belief Model. Wrong perception of cervical cancer and cervical cancer screening due to low level of knowledge about the disease and inadequate cervical cancer prevention were identified as the major determinants of low cervical cancer screening uptake in Nigeria. Among women, belief in being at risk and/or severity of cervical cancer was low just as belief on benefits of cervical cancer screening, unlike high belief in barriers to screening. Support from the community and screening skills among health-workers were inadequate. Improving uptake of cervical cancer screening will reduce the burden of the disease. Therefore, researchers and other stakeholders interested in prevention of cervical cancer should carryout studies to identify interventions that could address the key determinants of low cervical cancer screening among Nigerian women.",eng,Journal of public health in Africa,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, it remains unclear whether in vivo TLR4 sensing by HSPCs occurs directly or via other cell intermediates. In this study, we examined the cellular mechanisms underlying murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion and common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) depletion in a model of chronic low-dose LPS. Using adoptive-transfer approaches, we show that HSC and CLP sensitivity to chronic LPS depends on hematopoietic-derived, cell subset-autonomous TLR4. Like murine progenitors, human HSPCs are activated by TLR4 in vitro. Using humanized mice, a preclinical model relevant to human physiology, we show that persistent endotoxin increases the frequency of Ki-67(+) HSCs and severely depletes CLPs and B precursors. Together, our findings show that murine HSPCs directly respond to endotoxin in vivo and that persistent LPS, a feature of several diseases of global health significance, impairs human lymphopoiesis.",eng,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26276763,10.1093/heapol/czu064,The global health network on alcohol control: successes and limits of evidence-based advocacy.,"Global efforts to address alcohol harm have significantly increased since the mid-1990 s. By 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) had adopted the non-binding Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol. This study investigates the role of a global health network, anchored by the Global Alcohol Policy Alliance (GAPA), which has used scientific evidence on harm and effective interventions to advocate for greater global public health efforts to reduce alcohol harm. The study uses process-tracing methodology and expert interviews to evaluate the accomplishments and limitations of this network. The study documents how network members have not only contributed to greater global awareness about alcohol harm, but also advanced a public health approach to addressing this issue at the global level. Although the current network represents an expanding global coalition of like-minded individuals, it faces considerable challenges in advancing its cause towards successful implementation of effective alcohol control policies across many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The analysis reveals a need to transform the network into a formal coalition of regional and national organizations that represent a broader variety of constituents, including the medical community, consumer groups and development-focused non-governmental organizations. Considering the growing harm of alcohol abuse in LMICs and the availability of proven and cost-effective public health interventions, alcohol control represents an excellent 'buy' for donors interested in addressing non-communicable diseases. Alcohol control has broad beneficial effects for human development, including promoting road safety and reducing domestic violence and health care costs across a wide variety of illnesses caused by alcohol consumption.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, Masters of Public Health (MPH) curricula in the USA do not provide germane coursework.--NEW SECTION--To assess the availability of global NCD courses in MPH curricula, we searched the websites of the 50 schools accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health as of 1 July 2013. Our questionnaire queried availability of a global or international health department or track, availability of an NCD track, and the presence of courses on NCD, NCD risk factors, CVD or global NCDs as well as global health infrastructure.--NEW SECTION--All schools had online course coursework available. Thirty-one schools (62%) offered a global/international health track or certificate; 38 (76%) offered an NCD course but only 4 (8%) offered a global NCD course. Of the schools with a global health program, none required an NCD course but all offered courses on global health economics or infrastructure.--NEW SECTION--For public health schools to be aligned with global realities and to retain a leadership role, curricular initiatives that highlight the NCD epidemic and its societal complexities will need new emphasis.",eng,"Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Hydroxyurea represents the only available disease-modifying therapy for SCA, and has proven safety and efficacy in high-resource countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, there is minimal use of hydroxyurea, due to lack of data, absence of evidence-based guidelines, and inexperience among healthcare providers.--NEW SECTION--A partnership was established between investigators in North America and sub-Saharan Africa, to develop a prospective multicenter research protocol designed to provide data on the safety, feasibility, and benefits of hydroxyurea for children with SCA.--NEW SECTION--The Realizing Effectiveness Across Continents with Hydroxyurea (REACH, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01966731) trial is a prospective, phase I/II open-label dose escalation study of hydroxyurea that will treat a total of 600 children age 1-10 years with SCA: 150 at each of four different clinical sites within sub-Saharan Africa (Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and Uganda). The primary study endpoint will be severe hematological toxicities that occur during the fixed-dose treatment phase. REACH has an adaptive statistical design that allows for careful assessment of toxicities to accurately identify a safe hydroxyurea dose.--NEW SECTION--REACH will provide data that address critical gaps in knowledge for the treatment of SCA in sub-Saharan Africa. By developing local expertise with the use of hydroxyurea and helping to establish treatment guidelines, the REACH trial results will have the potential to transform care for children with SCA in Africa.",eng,Pediatric blood & cancer,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In developing countries, extrapulmonary TB often presents as an acute abdomen in surgical emergencies such as perforations and obstructions of the gut. Abdominal TB in different forms has been found more often as an aetiology for the chronic abdomen. This paper aims to evaluate TB as a surgical problem.--NEW SECTION--A comprehensive review of the literature on abdominal TB was undertaken. PubMed searches for articles listing abdominal TB/different types/diagnosis/treatment (1980-2012) were performed.--NEW SECTION--TB is still a global health problem and the abdomen is one of the most common sites of extrapulmonary TB. Presentation may vary from an acute abdomen to a number of different chronic presentations, which can mimic other abdominal diseases. While some may benefit from antitubercular therapy, others may develop surgical problems such as strictures or obstruction, which may necessitate surgical intervention.--NEW SECTION--Abdominal TB should always be considered one of the differential diagnoses of acute or chronic abdomen in endemic areas.",eng,Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26273062,10.1093/heapol/czu114,Agenda setting for maternal survival: the power of global health networks and norms.,"Nearly 300,000 women--almost all poor women in low-income countries--died from pregnancy-related complications in 2010. This represents a decline since the 1980s, when an estimated half million women died each year, but is still far higher than the aims set in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) at the turn of the century. The 1970s, 1980s and 1990 s witnessed a shift from near complete neglect of the issue to emergence of a network of individuals and organizations with a shared concern for reducing maternal deaths and growth in the number of organizations and governments with maternal health strategies and programmes. Maternal health experienced a marked change in agenda status in the 2000s, attracting significantly higher level attention (e.g. from world leaders) and greater resource commitments (e.g. as one issue addressed by US$40 billion in pledges to the 2010 Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health) than ever before. Several differences between network and actor features, issue characteristics and the policy environment pre- and post-2000 help to explain the change in agenda status for global maternal mortality reduction. Significantly, a strong poverty reduction norm emerged at the turn of the century; represented by the United Nations MDGs framework, the norm set unusually strong expectations for international development actors to advance included issues. As the norm grew, it drew policy attention to the maternal health goal (MDG 5). Seeking to advance the goals agenda, world leaders launched initiatives addressing maternal and child health. New network governance and framing strategies that closely linked maternal, newborn and child health shaped the initiatives. Diverse network composition--expanding beyond a relatively narrowly focused and technically oriented group to encompass allies and leaders that brought additional resources to bear on the problem--was crucial to maternal health's rise on the agenda in the 2000s.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26272648,10.1002/14651858.CD011163.pub2,Multiple risk factor interventions for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in low- and middle-income countries.,"In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have grown exponentially over recent years. It is estimated that about 80% of CVD deaths occur in LMICs. People in LMICs are more exposed to cardiovascular risk factors such as tobacco, and often do not have access to effective and equitable healthcare services (including early detection services). Evidence from high-income countries indicates that multiple risk factor intervention programmes do not result in reductions in CVD events. Given the increasing incidence of CVDs and lower CVD health awareness in LMICs it is possible that such programmes may have beneficial effects.--NEW SECTION--To determine the effectiveness of multiple risk factor interventions (with or without pharmacological treatment) aimed at modifying major cardiovascular risk factors for the primary prevention of CVD in LMICs.--NEW SECTION--We searched (from inception to 27 June 2014) the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, HTA, DARE, EED), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and three other databases on 27 June 2014. We also searched two clinical trial registers and conducted reference checking to identify additional studies. We applied no language limits.--NEW SECTION--We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of health promotion interventions to achieve behaviour change (i.e. smoking cessation, dietary advice, increasing activity levels) with or without pharmacological treatments, which aim to alter more than one cardiovascular risk factor (i.e. diet, reduce blood pressure, smoking, total blood cholesterol or increase physical activity) of at least six months duration of follow-up conducted in LMICs.--NEW SECTION--Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data using mean differences (MDs), and presented all results with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease events.--NEW SECTION--Thirteen trials met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias. Some studies were at high risk of bias for random sequence generation (two trials), allocation concealment (two trials), blinding of outcome assessors (one trial) and incomplete outcome data (one trial). Duration and content of multiple risk factor interventions varied across the trials. Two trials recruited healthy participants and the other 11 trials recruited people with varying risks of CVD, such as participants with known hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Only one study reported CVD outcomes and multiple risk factor interventions did not reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.07, 232 participants, low-quality evidence); the result is imprecise (a wide confidence interval and small sample size) and makes it difficult to draw a reliable conclusion. None of the included trials reported all-cause mortality. The pooled effect indicated a reduction in systolic blood pressure (MD -6.72 mmHg, 95% CI -9.82 to -3.61, I² = 91%, 4868 participants, low-quality evidence), diastolic blood pressure (MD -4.40 mmHg, 95% CI -6.47 to -2.34, I² = 92%, 4701 participants, low-quality evidence), body mass index (MD -0.76 kg/m², 95% CI -1.29 to -0.22, I² = 80%, 2984 participants, low-quality evidence) and waist circumference (MD -3.31, 95% CI -4.77 to -1.86, I² = 55%, 393 participants, moderate-quality evidence) in favour of multiple risk factor interventions, but there was substantial heterogeneity. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of these interventions on consumption of fruit or vegetables, smoking cessation, glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol. None of the included trials reported on adverse events.--NEW SECTION--Due to the limited evidence currently available, we can draw no conclusions as to the effectiveness of multiple risk factor interventions on combined CVD events and mortality. There is some evidence that multiple risk factor interventions may lower blood pressure levels, body mass index and waist circumference in populations in LMIC settings at high risk of hypertension and diabetes. There was considerable heterogeneity between the trials, the trials were small, and at some risk of bias. Larger studies with longer follow-up periods are required to confirm whether multiple risk factor interventions lead to reduced CVD events and mortality in LMIC settings.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Programs with global health curricula were queried regarding classification, collaboration details, regions visited, conditions/procedures encountered, costs, accreditation, and personal sentiment. Residencies without global health curricula were asked to select barriers.--NEW SECTION--Sixty-four of 81 residency programs returned questionnaires (response rate, 79 percent). Twenty-six programs (41 percent) reported including a formal global health curriculum; 38 did not (59 percent). When asked to classify this curriculum, most selected clinical care experience [n = 24 (92 percent)], followed by educational experience [n = 19 (73 percent)]. Personal reference was the most common means of establishing the international collaboration [n = 19 (73 percent)]. The most commonly encountered conditions were cleft lip-cleft palate [n = 26 (100 percent)], thermal injury [n = 17 (65 percent)], and posttraumatic reconstruction [n = 15 (57 percent)]. Dominant funding sources were primarily nonprofit organizations [n = 14 (53 percent)].

Anosmin-1 (ANOS1) gene encodes a cell adhesion molecule that plays diverse roles in multiple malignancies. We performed global expression profiling of GC cell lines and small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments to determine the effect of ANOS1 expression on phenotype. We evaluated the association of ANOS1 mRNA and protein levels in patients' tissue and sera with clinicopathological factors of GC subtypes. Differential expression of ANOS1 mRNA by GC cell lines correlated positively to levels of ITGAV, FOXC2 and NODAL mRNAs and inversely with those of TFPI2. Inhibiting ANOS1 expression decreased the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells. The mean level of ANOS1 mRNA was significantly higher in 237 GC tissues compared with the corresponding noncancerous adjacent tissues. Elevated ANOS1 levels associated significantly with the phenotypes of GC, shorter disease-free and overall survival. ANOS1 expression was a more significant prognostic marker for diffuse and distal nondiffuse GC. ANOS1 concentrations in sera increased sequentially in sera of healthy subjects, localized GC and disseminated GCs. Prognosis was worse for patients with preoperative serum ANOS1 ≥ 600 pg/ml compared with those with <600 pg/ml. ANOS1 may represent a biomarker for GC phenotypes and as a target for therapy.",eng,International journal of cancer,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The situation is especially bad in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2008, the World Health Organization and the Global Health Workforce Alliance launched a call for proposals for a public health training programme with an emphasis on health workforce development specifically targeting Africa. Our article presents the development, implementation and evaluation of an e-learning Master of Advanced Studies in Public Health on Workforce Development. The project was developed in collaboration with academic partner institutions of 10 French-speaking African countries and local/regional/HQ WHO offices.--NEW SECTION--A five-step approach was adopted. First, a needs assessment study was done in the target countries, with identification of priority health issues. Second, student and tutor selection was done in collaboration with local WHO offices, health authorities and partner universities. Third, the e-platform was developed and a training workshop for tutors was organized. Fourth, the learning objectives were derived from the needs assessment study and an interactive educational approach was adopted. Fifth, the participation of students, their perception of the programme, their performance on assignments and community outcomes were monitored.--NEW SECTION--The needs assessment allowed the identification of 12 priority health issues (trauma related to road accidents, maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, mental heath, food and malnutrition, health resource management, infectious diseases, access to essential drugs, chronic diseases, health promotion, ageing and violence/conflicts) of which 10 were studied through the lens of the key public health disciplines (epidemiology, human resources, health project/service planning, health policy, communication, health economics/management, informatics and ethics/human rights), each validated through a certifying examination. Student participation, measured through connection hits (total: 58 256; mean: 168/student/module) and posted messages (total: 5994; mean: 18/student/module), was good, and global satisfaction was high (7.7/10). Twenty-nine students out of 37 obtained their master's degree from the University of Geneva. Outcomes reported include career development, strengthening of inter-country networks and common projects.--NEW SECTION--Keys to the success of the programme were the enthusiasm and commitment of students, the availability of the coordination team, the simplicity of the electronic platform and the support of local/regional/WHO offices.

We describe the molecular characteristics of HBV and prevalence of escape mutants among HIV/HBV coinfected individuals Botswana.--NEW SECTION--DNA was extracted from archived plasma samples from 81 HIV/HBV co-infected participants from various clinical studies at the Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership. A 415 base pair (bp) fragment of the polymerase gene was amplified by semi-nested PCR. In a subset of samples, a 2100 bp fragment was amplified. The PCR product was genotyped using Big Dye sequencing chemistry and the sequences were analysed for genotypes and mutations.--NEW SECTION--Of the 81 samples included, 70 (86 %) samples were successfully genotyped. Genotype A was found in 56 (80 %) participants, D in 13 (18.6 %), and 1 (1.4 %) was genotype E. Escape mutations previously linked with failure of diagnosis or escaping active vaccination and passive immunoglobulin therapy were detected in 12 (17.1 %) participants at positions 100, 119, 122, 123, 124, 126, 129, 130, 133, 134 and 140 of the S ORF. Genotypes and escape mutations were not significantly associated with aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST platelet ratio index (APRI).--NEW SECTION--Genotypes A, D and E were found in this cohort of HIV coinfected patients in Botswana, consistent with the findings from the sub-Saharan Africa region. Some escape mutations which have previously been associated with diagnosis failure, escaping vaccine and immunoglobulin therapy were also observed and are important in guiding future policies related to vaccine implementation, therapeutic guidelines, and diagnostic guidelines. They are also important for identifying patients who are at an increased risk of disease progression and to choose optimal therapy. Future research should focus on determining the clinical significance of the different HBV genotypes and mutations found in this population.",eng,BMC infectious diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Single-institution partnerships and surgical missions are logistically limited. The Alliance for Global Clinical Training (hereafter the Alliance) is a consortium of US surgical departments that aims to provide continuous educational support at the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (MUHAS). To our knowledge, the Alliance is the first multi-institutional international surgical collaboration to be described in the literature.--NEW SECTION--To assess if the Alliance is effectively responding to the educational needs of MUHAS and Muhimbili National Hospital surgeons.--NEW SECTION--During an initial 13-month program (July 1, 2013, to August 31, 2014), faculty and resident teams from 3 US academic surgical programs rotated at MUHAS as physicians and teachers for 1 month each. To assess the value of the project, we administered anonymous surveys.--NEW SECTION--Anonymous surveys were analyzed on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Free-text answers were analyzed for common themes.--NEW SECTION--During the study period, Alliance members were present at MUHAS for 8 months (1 month each). At the conclusion of the first year of collaboration, 15 MUHAS faculty and 22 MUHAS residents completed the survey. The following 6 areas of educational needs were identified: formal didactics, increased clinical mentorship, longer-term Alliance presence, equitable distribution of teaching time, improved coordination and language skills, and reciprocal exchange rotations at US hospitals. The MUHAS faculty and residents agreed that Alliance members contributed to improved patient care and resident education.--NEW SECTION--A multi-institutional international surgical partnership is possible and leads to perceived improvements in patient care and resident learning. Alliance surgeons must continue to focus on training Tanzanian surgeons. Improving the volunteer surgeons' Swahili-language skills would be an asset. Future efforts should provide more teaching coverage, equitably distribute educational support among all MUHAS surgeons, and collaboratively develop a formal surgical curriculum.",eng,JAMA surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Current drugs against HBV infection are limited by emergence of resistance and rarely achieve complete viral clearance. This has prompted vigorous research on developing better drugs against chronic HBV infection. Advances in understanding the life cycle of HBV and improvements in gene-disabling technologies have been impressive. This has led to development of better HBV infection models and discovery of new drug candidates. Ideally, a regimen against chronic HBV infection should completely eliminate all viral replicative intermediates, especially covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). For the past few decades, nucleic acid-based therapy has emerged as an attractive alternative that may result in complete clearance of HBV in infected patients. Several genetic anti-HBV strategies have been developed. The most studied approaches include the use of antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, RNA interference effectors and gene editing tools. This review will summarize recent developments and progress made in the use of gene therapy against HBV.",eng,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Astaxanthin (AST) has a good prospect in production of nutritional, medical, and particularly functional health drug. The present study was aimed to study the effect of AST on DICD in diabetes mellitus (DM) rat through suppression of oxidative stress, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway, inflammatory reaction and upregulation of PI3K/Akt. In the study, Morris water maze teat was used to detect the cognitive function of DM rat. Afterwards, we measured the body weight and blood glucose levels of DM rats. Then, oxidative stress, the activities of eNOS and iNOS, and inflammatory factors were analyzed using a commercial kit in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Finally, the caspase-3/9 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt expressions were also checkout with Real Time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. In this experiment, AST could availably enhance the body weight and reduce blood glucose levels of DM rats. Moreover, AST could observably perfect cognitive function of DM rat. Next, the activities of oxidative stress, nitric oxide synthase and inflammation were distinctly diminution in DM rat, after the treatment of AST. Furthermore, our present results demonstrated that AST had the protective effect on the brain cell of DM rat, decreased the caspase-3/9 expression and promoted the expression of PI3K/Akt in cerebral cortex and hippocampus.",eng,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We sought to characterize GH education opportunities across pediatric residency programs and identify program characteristics associated with key GH education elements.--NEW SECTION--Data on program and GH training characteristics were sought from program directors or their delegates of all US pediatric residency programs during 2013 to 2014. These data were used to compare programs with and without a GH track as well as across small, medium, and large programs. Program characteristics associated with the presence of key educational elements were identified by using bivariate logistic regression.--NEW SECTION--Data were collected from 198 of 199 active US pediatric residency programs (99.5%). Seven percent of pediatric trainees went abroad during 2013 to 2014. Forty-nine programs (24.7%) reported having a GH track, 66.1% had a faculty lead, 58.1% offered international field experiences, and 48.5% offered domestic field experiences. Forty-two percent of programs reported international partnerships across 153 countries. Larger programs, those with lead faculty, GH tracks, or partnerships had significantly increased odds of having each GH educational element, including pretravel preparation.--NEW SECTION--The number of pediatric residency programs offering GH training opportunities continues to rise. However, smaller programs and those without tracks, lead faculty, or formal partnerships lag behind with organized GH curricula. As GH becomes an integral component of pediatric training, a heightened commitment is needed to ensure consistency of training experiences that encompass best practices in all programs.",eng,Pediatrics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

VZV reactivation is subject to the opposing mechanisms of declining and boosted VZV-specific cellular mediated immunity (CMI). A reduction in exogenous re-exposure 'opportunities' through universal chickenpox vaccination could therefore lead to an increase in HZ incidence. We present the first individual-based model that integrates within-host data on VZV-CMI and between-host transmission data to simulate HZ incidence. This model allows estimating currently unknown pivotal biomedical parameters, including the duration of exogenous boosting at 2 years, with a peak threefold to fourfold increase of VZV-CMI; the VZV weekly reactivation probability at 5% and VZV subclinical reactivation having no effect on VZV-CMI. A 100% effective chickenpox vaccine given to 1 year olds would cause a 1.75 times peak increase in HZ 31 years after implementation.

29354524,10.2147/IPRP.S70404,Optimizing pharmacotherapy in elderly patients: the role of pharmacists.,"As the world's population ages, global health care systems will face the burden of chronic diseases and polypharmacy use among older adults. The traditional tasks of medication dispensing and provision of basic education by pharmacists have evolved to active engagement in direct patient care and collaborative team-based care. The care of older patients is an especially fitting mission for pharmacists, since the key to geriatric care often lies with management of chronic diseases and polypharmacy use, and preventing harmful consequences of both. Because most chronic conditions are treated with medications, pharmacists, with their extensive training in pharmacotherapy and pharmacokinetics, are in a unique and critical position in the management of them. Pharmacists have the expertise to detect, resolve, and prevent medication errors and drug-related problems, such as overtreatment, undertreatment, adverse drug events, and nonadherence. Pharmacists are also competent in critically reviewing and applying clinical guidelines to the care of individual patients, and in some instances confront the lack of data (common in older adults) to provide the best possible patient-centered care. The current review aimed to depict the evidence of geriatric pharmacy care, demonstrate current impact of pharmacists' interventions on older patients, survey the tools used by pharmacists to provide effective care, and explore their role in pharmacotherapy optimization in elders. The findings of the current review strongly support previous studies that showed positive impact of pharmacists' interventions on older patients' health-related outcomes. There is a clear role for pharmacists working directly or collaboratively to improve medication use and management in older populations. Therefore, in global health care systems, teams caring for elders should involve pharmacists to optimize pharmacotherapy.",eng,Integrated pharmacy research & practice,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Although multimodal therapies have proven to benefit patients with advanced diseases after curative surgery, the prognosis of most advanced cancer patients still needs to be improved. Surgical extirpation is the mainstay of gastric cancer treatment. Indeed, without curative surgery, variations and combinations of chemotherapy and/or radiation cannot bring clinically meaningful success. Centered around D2 surgery, adjuvant and peri-operative multimodal therapies have improved survival in a certain group of gastric cancer patients. Moving toward a personalized cancer therapy era, molecular targeted strategies have been tested in clinical trials for gastric cancer. With some success and failures, we have learned valuable lessons regarding the biology of gastric cancer and the clinical relevance of biological therapies in addition to conventional treatments. Future treatment of gastric cancer will be shifted to molecularly tailored and genome information-based personalized therapy. Collaboration across disciplines and actively adopting emerging anti-cancer strategies, along with in-depth understanding of molecular and genetic underpinnings of tumor development and progression, are imperative to realizing personalized therapy for gastric cancer. Although many challenges remain to be overcome, we envision that the era of precision cancer medicine for gastric cancer has already arrived and anticipate that current knowledge and discoveries will be transformed into near-future clinical practice for managing gastric cancer patients.",eng,Yonsei medical journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

It contributes to a growing ethnography on global health, biosociality, and patient-provider dynamics. Therapeutic citizenship is a biopolitical citizenship that includes claims and ethical projects that emerge from techniques to control and manage bodies. In some contexts, therapeutic citizenship has included activism and claims-making against local, national, and international power brokers. This article investigates therapeutic citizenship in the specific context of impoverished urban Zambian compounds, sites of food insecurity, unemployment, and political exclusion, as well as targets for donor, NGO, and faith-based organisation projects and PLHIV support group proliferation. The article utilises data from participant observations at two Lusaka AIDS clinics, interviews, and focused discussions with support groups of PLHIVs. It argues that PLHIVs continuously negotiate subjectivities related to kinship, clientship, religious belief, and political citizenship in processes that complicate therapeutic citizenship. Rather than fostering participation in PLHIV support groups or challenging 'politics as usual' through activist claims-making to institutions of biopower, these processes lead to therapeutic pacifism.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Over the past four decades, researchers have attempted to overcome this issue by developing single-administration vaccines based on controlled-release antigen delivery systems. These systems can be administered once, but release antigen over an extended period of time to elicit both primary and secondary immune responses resulting in antigen-specific immunological memory. Unfortunately, unlike controlled release systems for drugs, single-administration vaccines have yet to be commercialized due to poor antigen stability and difficulty in obtaining unconventional release kinetics.

Although the political process that led to the creation of the FCTC has been extensively researched, the FCTC's progression from an aspirational treaty towards a global health governance framework with tangible policy effects within FCTC member countries has not been well-understood to date. This article analyses the role of the global health network of tobacco control advocates and scientists, which formed during the FCTC negotiations during the late 1990 s, in translating countries' commitment to the FCTC into domestic policy change. By comparing the network's influence around two central tobacco control interventions (smoke-free environments and taxation), the study identifies several scope conditions, which have shaped the network's effectiveness around the FCTC's implementation: the complexity of the policy issue and the relative importance of non-health expertise, the required scope of domestic political buy-in, the role of the general public as network allies, and the strength of policy opposition. These political factors had a greater influence on the network's success than the evidence base for the effectiveness of tobacco control interventions. The network's variable success points to a trade-off faced by global health networks between their need to maintain internal cohesion and their ability to form alliances with actors in their social environment.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Building on our review of the existing measles and rubella health economics literature, we develop inputs for use in regional and global models of the expected future benefits and costs of vaccination, treatment, surveillance, and other global coordination activities. Given diversity in the world and limited data, we characterize the costs for countries according to the 2013 World Bank income levels using 2013 U.S. dollars (2013$US). We estimate that routine immunization and supplemental immunization activities will cost governments and donors over 2013$US 2.3 billion per year for the foreseeable future, with high-income countries accounting for 55% of the costs, to vaccinate global birth cohorts of approximately 134 million surviving infants and to protect the global population of over 7 billion people. We find significantly higher costs and health consequences of measles or rubella disease than with vaccine use, with the expected disability-adjusted life year (DALY) loss for case of disease generally at least 100 times the loss per vaccine dose. To support estimates of the economic benefits of investments in measles and/or rubella elimination or control, we characterize the probabilities of various sequelae of measles and rubella infections and vaccine adverse events, the DALY inputs for health outcomes, and the associated treatment costs.

These associations help explain the depression-executive dysfunction syndrome observed in LLD, and support cerebrovascular burden as a pathogenic mechanism. Furthermore, this review suggests that neuroimaging determinants of treatment resistance also reflect cerebrovascular burden. Of the theoretical etiologies of LLD, cerebrovascular burden may mediate treatment resistance. This review proposes that neuroimaging has the potential for clinical translation. Controlled trials may identify neuroimaging biomarkers that may inform treatment by identifying depressed adults likely to remit with pharmacotherapy, identifying individualized therapeutic dose, and facilitating earlier treatment response measures. Neuroimaging also has the potential to similarly inform treatment response variability from treatment with aripiprazole (dopamine modulator) and buprenorphine (opiate modulator).",eng,Dialogues in clinical neuroscience,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26246114,10.1007/s00268-015-3179-1,Evaluating Progress in the Global Surgical Crisis: Contrasting Access to Emergency and Essential Surgery and Safe Anesthesia Around the World.,"Since 2007, observations reveal that low- and middle-income countries (LICs and LMICs) experience similar surgical access and safety issues, though the etiology of these challenges varies by country. The collective voice of surveys completed to date has pushed the agenda for the inclusion of safe surgery and anesthesia within global health discussions. Comparison of four countries across the world shows similar basic progress as well as ongoing surgical and anesthesia needs in resource-challenged countries. By studying these common needs, a comprehensive plan to provide infrastructure and personnel support can work in multiple austere settings.--NEW SECTION--A standardized survey tool published, designed, and developed initially by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and modified at Vanderbilt University was completed in Guatemala, Guyana, Laos, and Mozambique. The survey assessed eight key areas of essential surgical care: access to and availability of surgical services, access to human resources, essential infrastructure (including access to water, electricity, sanitation, blood products, and essential medicines including supplemental oxygen), surgical outcomes, operating room information and procedures, equipment, International Organization, and Non-Government Organization provision of surgical care. These results were compared and contrasted to evaluate resource challenges and assets in each country.--NEW SECTION--A total of 49 hospitals were surveyed in this comparison cohort. The results reveal common needs for emergency and essential surgery in each country, but some differences in human and capital resources exist. While minimal resources exist, all surgical sites provided running water, electricity, and oxygen-assets not seen in previous surveys as recent as 2011.--NEW SECTION--The most basic needs to provide essential surgery are now present in LICs and LMICs. Many more resources are needed to ensure access to safe surgery and anesthesia. The next steps to provide essential surgery must include common solutions for access to surgery and anesthesia, and an evaluation of patient safety in these endeavors through the perioperative mortality rate.",eng,World journal of surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26245177,NA,Moving toward universal access to health and universal health coverage: a review of comprehensive primary health care in Suriname.,"To provide an overview of comprehensive primary health care (CPHC) development and implementation in Suriname in peer-reviewed literature.--NEW SECTION--Building on work funded by the Teasdale-Corti Global Health Research Partnership Program/People's Health Movement, the authors searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and POPLINE for articles focused on CPHC within the Surinamese context. Two authors independently reviewed abstracts and then jointly reviewed the selected abstracts. The final selection was completed using a data extraction form.--NEW SECTION--The initial search resulted in 1 556 abstracts. The initial review identified 58 articles. Only three of the 58 articles met the inclusion criteria for the final review. The three selected articles provided partial overviews of CPHC in Suriname and examples of its implementation, with a focus on the service delivery network in the interior of the country, which was designed to improve rural access to basic health care services by training community members as service providers. They also included examples of how preparations for health reform in Suriname in the late 1990s and early 2000s, influenced by global neoliberal reforms, led to expectations that disparities in health status, design of health system components, and service provision related to differences in power and historical context (e.g., the influence of medical professionals, political parties/ethnic groups, and wealthier populations concentrated in urban areas) would be addressed.--NEW SECTION--Given the focus on primary health care in the Americas and the notable developments that have occurred in Surinamese health policy and health care, particularly in health care reform, the paucity of published research on CPHC in Suriname was an unexpected finding that may be partly due to prioritizing research on disease control rather than health policy and systems research. The limited amount of scientific literature on this topic 1) prevents clear understanding of CPHC development and implementation in Suriname and 2) underscores the need to strengthen the national health research system to better inform policies for moving the country toward universal health access and coverage to improve the health of all of its citizens.",eng,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Chikungunya virus represents a new threat. Surged from remote African regions, this virus has become endemic in the Indic ocean basin, the Indian subcontinent and the southeast of Asia, causing serious epidemics in Africa, Indic Ocean Islands, Asia and Europe. Due to their epidemiological and biological features and the global presence of their vectors, chikungunya represents a serious menace and could become endemic in the Americas. Although chikungunya infection has a low mortality rate, its high attack ratio may collapse the health system during epidemics affecting a sensitive population. In this paper, we review the clinical and epidemiological features of chikungunya fever as well as the risk of its introduction into the Americas.

To-date, assessment of their global distributions and health impacts has been limited by insufficient comparable and reliable data by country, age, and sex.--NEW SECTION--To quantify global, regional, and national levels of SSB, fruit juice, and milk intake by age and sex in adults over age 20 in 2010.--NEW SECTION--We identified, obtained, and assessed data on intakes of these beverages in adults, by age and sex, from 193 nationally- or subnationally-representative diet surveys worldwide, representing over half the world's population. We also extracted data relevant to milk, fruit juice, and SSB availability for 187 countries from annual food balance information collected by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to account for measurement incomparability, study representativeness, and sampling and modeling uncertainty, and to combine and harmonize nationally representative dietary survey data and food availability data.--NEW SECTION--In 2010, global average intakes were 0.58 (95%UI: 0.37, 0.89) 8 oz servings/day for SSBs, 0.16 (0.10, 0.26) for fruit juice, and 0.57 (0.39, 0.83) for milk. There was significant heterogeneity in consumption of each beverage by region and age. Intakes of SSB were highest in the Caribbean (1.9 servings/day; 1.2, 3.0); fruit juice consumption was highest in Australia and New Zealand (0.66; 0.35, 1.13); and milk intake was highest in Central Latin America and parts of Europe (1.06; 0.68, 1.59). Intakes of all three beverages were lowest in East Asia and Oceania. Globally and within regions, SSB consumption was highest in younger adults; fruit juice consumption showed little relation with age; and milk intakes were highest in older adults.--NEW SECTION--Our analysis highlights the enormous spectrum of beverage intakes worldwide, by country, age, and sex.

26243811,10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-052114,State-ownership of tobacco industry: a 'fundamental conflict of interest' or a 'tremendous opportunity' for tobacco control?,"Despite state-owned tobacco companies (SOTCs) accounting for over 40% of global production, the significance of state-ownership for tobacco control strategies has received limited academic and policy attention. The complex interests associated with SOTCs present diverse challenges for tobacco control policy, particularly in implementing Article 5.3 of WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Based on a review of existing literature, this paper examines current challenges and potential opportunities presented by governmental participation in the tobacco industry, identifying three contrasting perspectives from academic and policy sources. The first two perspectives centre on recognising that economic interests inherent in an SOTC are in tension with a government's public health responsibilities. This conflict can be perceived as either fundamental and fixed ('intrinsic conflict') or as amenable to either exacerbation or amelioration via organisational mechanisms ('institutionally-mediated conflict')-as suggested by the contrasting examples of China and Thailand. A third, less prominent perspective (which we refer to as 'interest alignment') suggests that it may be possible to radically alter the objectives and behaviour of SOTCs in order to advance tobacco control. Finally, we draw on this analysis to consider policy options for advancing tobacco control in countries with SOTCs. Guidance on implementation of Article 5.3 demonstrates strategic ambiguity by including elements of all three perspectives described above. We argue that legislative separation of tobacco control from SOTC oversight provides a desirable alternative to industry privatisation, and that radically realigning the goals of SOTCs to reduce tobacco consumption could make an important contribution to endgame strategies.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26243486,10.17061/phrp2531527,The national and international regulatory environment in tobacco control.,"Despite their lethality, cigarettes are subject to little regulation that directly restricts their contents or their legality. This may change in the near future with the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the world's first global health treaty, now in force, as well as developments in a few individual countries. Cigarettes are subject to a substantial number of country-specific regulations regarding their conditions of sale: their price (mostly through taxation), the places where they can be consumed (clean indoor air laws), who can smoke them (prohibitions on their use by or sales to minors), how they can be advertised or promoted (if at all), and how they must be packaged (minimum pack sizes, warning labels, plain packaging). Such policies constitute the core of successful tobacco control. The FCTC has been ratified by 180 countries representing 90% of the world's population. The FCTC requires compliance with numerous provisions relating to the kinds of regulations noted above. The treaty also mandates explicit attention to direct product regulation. Several countries have such authority, at least in limited forms. In the US, for example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now has the legal authority to regulate tobacco products, including their contents. The possibility exists that, in the foreseeable future, a country will mandate product standards that will substantially reduce the appeal of cigarettes and other combusted tobacco products, which are by far the leading sources of the death and disease associated with tobacco.",eng,Public health research & practice,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Mental health status was measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The QoL outcomes were assessed longitudinally using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38 questionnaires at the baseline and 6 months after diagnosis.--NEW SECTION--Of the 852 survivors who responded (94 %), 187 (22 %) had a type D personality. The proportion of patients with duration of symptoms >1 month and being diagnosed after emergency admissions in type D group is significantly higher than that in non-type D group. At both of the time points, type D patients reported statistically significant lower scores on most of the functional scales, global health status/QoL scales, and worse symptom scores compared to patients without a type D personality. At the 6-month time point, a higher percentage of patients in the type D group demonstrated QoL deterioration. Clinically elevated levels of anxiety and depression were more prevalent in type D than in non-type D survivors.--NEW SECTION--Type D personality was associated with poor QoL and mental health status among survivors of rectal cancer, even after adjustment for confounding background variables.

Despite the many clinical trials conducted, currently no approved disease-modifying treatment exists. In this commentary, the present status of AD drug development and the grounds for collaborations between government, academia, and industry to accelerate the development of disease-modifying AD therapies are discussed.--NEW SECTION--Official government documents, literature, and news releases were surveyed by MEDLINE and website research.--NEW SECTION--Currently approved anti-AD drugs provide only short-lived symptomatic improvements, which have no effect on the underlying pathogenic mechanisms or progression of the disease. The failure to approve a disease-modifying drug for AD may be because the progression of AD in the patient populations enrolled in clinical studies was too advanced for drugs to demonstrate cognitive and functional improvements. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency recently published draft guidance for industry which discusses approaches for conducting clinical studies with patients in early AD stages. For successful clinical trials in early-stage AD, however, it will be necessary to identify biomarkers highly correlated with the clinical onset and the longitudinal progress of AD. In addition, because of the high cost and length of clinical AD studies, support in the form of global initiatives and collaborations between government, industry, and academia is needed.--NEW SECTION--In response to this situation, national guidance and international collaborations have been established.

However, the term DOHaD has not been generally accepted as the official term to be used when one is concerned with understanding the pathophysiological basis for how environmental influences acting during early development influence the risk of later noncommunicable diseases. Similarly, there is no global research or public health program built around the DOHaD paradigm that encompasses all aspects of environment. To better inform the global health efforts aimed at addressing the growing epidemic of chronic noncommunicable diseases of environmental origin, we propose a two-pronged approach: first, to make it clear that the current concept of DOHaD comprehensively includes a range of environmental factors and their relevance to disease occurrence not just throughout the life span but potentially across several generations; and second, to initiate the discussion of how adoption of DOHaD can promote a more realistic, accurate, and integrative approach to understanding environmental disruption of developmental programming and better inform clinical and policy interventions.",eng,Endocrinology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This array of hematological disorders is attributed to the fact that the blood system undergoes a perpetual cycle of turn over with aged and exhausted red and white blood cells undergoing daily replacement. The foundational cells of this replenishment process are comprised of rare hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) located in the bone marrow that possess the dual function of long-term self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. This constant turnover makes the hematopoietic system uniquely vulnerable to changes in the environment that impact multilineage differentiation, self-renewal, or both. Notably, environmental endocrine-disrupting exposures occurring during development, when HSCs are first emerging, can lead to alterations in HSC programming that impacts the blood and immune systems throughout life. In this review, we describe the process of fetal hematopoiesis and provide an overview of the intrauterine environmental and endocrine-disrupting compounds that disrupt this process. Finally, we describe research opportunities for fetal HSCs as potential sentinels of later-life blood and immune system disorders.",eng,Endocrinology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Currently licensed typhoid vaccines do not confer adequate cross-immunoprotection against S. Paratyphi A infection. Therefore, vaccines specifically against enteric fever caused by S. Paratyphi A are urgently needed. In the present study, an attenuated vaccine strain was constructed from S. Paratyphi A CMCC50093 by the deletions of aroC and yncD. The obtained strain SPADD01 showed reduced survival within THP-1 cells and less bacterial burden in spleens and livers of infected mice compared with the wild-type strain. The 50% lethal doses of SPADD01 and the wild-type strain were assessed using a murine infection model. The virulence of SPADD01 is approximately 40,000-fold less than that of the wild-type strain. In addition, SPADD01 showed an excellent immunogenicity in mouse model. Single intranasal inoculation elicited striking humoral and mucosal immune responses in mice and yielded effective protection against lethal challenge of the wild-type strain. A high level of cross-reactive humoral immune response against LPS of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi was also detected in immunized mice. However, SPADD01 vaccination only conferred a low level of cross-protection against S. Typhi. Our data suggest that SPADD01 is a promising vaccine candidate against S. Paratyphi A infection and deserves further evaluation in clinical trial. To date, no study has demonstrated a good cross-protection between serovars of S. Typhi and S.

Our analysis subdivides S. flexneri into seven phylogenetic groups (PGs); each containing two-or-more serotypes and characterised by distinct virulence gene complement and geographic range. Within the S. flexneri PGs we identify geographically restricted sub-lineages that appear to have persistently colonised regions for many decades to over 100 years. Although we found abundant evidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinant acquisition, our dataset shows no evidence of subsequent intercontinental spread of antimicrobial resistant strains.

From 125 articles, roughly half (67) did not specify the employment context of the participants in terms of migration status or subsistence versus commercial farming. Although in many regions worldwide women make up the bulk of the workforce, only a minority of low back disorder studies focus on women. Despite the predominance of the agricultural workforce in developing nations, 91% of included studies were conducted in developed nations. There was no significant difference in study quality by geographic region. The nature of the world's agricultural workforce is poorly represented by the literature when it comes to LBD research. If developing nations, female sex, and migrant work are related to increased vulnerability, then these groups need more representation to achieve equitable occupational health study.",eng,Journal of agromedicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Neurodevelopmental disability (NDD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) are the most common complications of prematurity. In fact, ROP is the second leading cause of childhood blindness in the world. Although there is much information regarding the occurrence of ROP and of NDD in premature infants, there have been few studies on ROP and its association with NDD. The objectives of this article are to review the current literature on the subject and to publish our own findings concerning the association between ROP and NDD in premature infants. The review suggests that although NDDs are related to degree of prematurity, NDD could also be the result of visual impairments resulting from ROP. Our own study shows a close association between NDD and zonal involvement of ROP: higher NDD if zone 1 is involved and less if zone 3 is involved.",eng,Seminars in fetal & neonatal medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Unfortunately, low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) suffer disproportionately from the world's cancer cases. The growing burden of cancer and maldistribution of cancer care resources in LMIC warrant a massive re-evaluation of the structural inequalities that produce global oncological disparities and a worldwide commitment to improve both prevention and treatment strategies. Efforts to improve cancer care capacity should focus on horizontal strengthening of healthcare systems that provide safe, affordable, effective and sustainable care. In response to current deficiencies, many international organizations have started to partner with LMIC to create solutions.

Using a primarily qualitative study design, we studied three experiences of mentorship and eight mentorship programmes for early career global health researchers based in high-income and low- and middle-income countries. For the latter, we drew upon programme materials, existing unpublished data and more formal mixed-method evaluations, supplemented by individual email questionnaire responses. Research team members wrote stories, and the team assembled and analysed them for key themes. Across the diverse experiences and programmes, key emergent themes included: great mentors inspire others in an inter-generational cascade, mentorship is transformative in personal and professional development and involves reciprocity, and finding the right balance in mentoring relationships and programmes includes responding creatively to failure. Among the challenges encountered were: struggling for more level playing fields for new health researchers globally, changing mindsets in institutions that do not have a culture of mentorship and building collaboration not competition. Mentoring networks spanning institutions and countries using multiple virtual and face-to-face methods are a potential avenue for fostering organisational cultures supporting quality mentorship in global health research.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Fat mass index (FMI, kg/m(2)), fat-free mass index (FFMI, kg/m(2)), and percent fat mass may be useful to evaluate under- and overnutrition and muscle development in a clinical or research environment. This proof-of-concept study tested whether frontal whole-body silhouettes could be used to accurately measure body composition parameters using active shape modeling (ASM) techniques.--NEW SECTION--Binary shape images (silhouettes) were generated from the skin outline of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) whole-body scans of 200 healthy children of ages from 6 to 16 yr. The silhouette shape variation from the average was described using an ASM, which computed principal components for unique modes of shape. Predictive models were derived from the modes for FMI, FFMI, and percent fat using stepwise linear regression. The models were compared to simple models using demographics alone [age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index z-scores (BMIZ)].--NEW SECTION--The authors found that 95% of the shape variation of the sampled population could be explained using 26 modes. In most cases, the body composition variables could be predicted similarly between demographics-only and shape-only models. However, the combination of shape with demographics improved all estimates of boys and girls compared to the demographics-only model. The best prediction models for FMI, FFMI, and percent fat agreed with the actual measures with R(2) adj. (the coefficient of determination adjusted for the number of parameters used in the model equation) values of 0.86, 0.95, and 0.75 for boys and 0.90, 0.89, and 0.69 for girls, respectively.--NEW SECTION--Whole-body silhouettes in children may be useful to derive estimates of body composition including FMI, FFMI, and percent fat.

This study aimed to describe the home environment and measure IAP in the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS), an African birth cohort.--NEW SECTION--An antenatal home visit to assess the home environment and measure IAP (particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) was done on pregnant women enrolled to the DCHS, in a low-socioeconomic, peri-urban South African community. Urine cotinine measured maternal tobacco smoking and exposure. Dwellings were categorised according to 6 household dimensions. Univariate and multivariate analysis explored associations between home environment, seasons and IAP levels measured.--NEW SECTION--633 home visits were completed, with IAP measured in 90% of homes. Almost a third of participants were of the lowest socio-economic status and the majority of homes (65%) lacked 2 or more of the dwelling category dimensions. Most households had electricity (92%), however, fossil fuels were still used for cooking (19%) and heating (15%) in homes. Antenatal maternal smoking prevalence was 31%; 44% had passive smoke exposure. Of IAP measured, benzene (VOC) was significantly above ambient standards with median 5.6 μg/m3 (IQR 2.6-17.1). There were significant associations between the use of fossil fuels for cooking and increased benzene [OR 3.4 (95% CI 2.1-5.4)], carbon monoxide [OR 2.9 (95% CI 1.7-5.0)] and nitrogen dioxide [OR 18.6 (95% CI 3.9-88.9)] levels. A significant seasonal association was found with higher IAP levels in winter.--NEW SECTION--In this low-socioeconomic African community, multiple environmental factors and pollutants, with the potential to affect child health, were identified.

For most countries such data are not routinely available. We estimated the national, regional, and global prevalence of chronic HBV infection.--NEW SECTION--For this systematic review and pooled analysis, we searched for data on prevalence of chronic HBV infection published between Jan 1, 1965, and Oct 23, 2013, in the databases Medline, Embase, CAB Abstracts (Global health), Popline, and Web of Science. We included studies reporting the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) serological marker of chronic HBV infection in non-high-risk groups and extracted data into a customised database. For each country, we calculated HBsAg prevalence estimates and 95% CIs weighted by study size. We extrapolated prevalence estimates to population sizes in 2010 to obtain the number of individuals with chronic HBV infection.--NEW SECTION--Of the 17,029 records screened, 1800 report on the prevalence of HBsAg covering 161 countries were included. HBsAg seroprevalence was 3·61% (95% CI 3·61-3·61) worldwide with highest endemicity in countries of the African region (total 8·83%, 8·82-8·83) and Western Pacific region (total 5·26%, 5·26-5·26).

26229678,10.1002/jmrs.105,Obese patients and radiography literature: what do we know about a big issue?,"Obesity is a global health issue with obese patients requiring specialised diagnosis, treatment and care through the health service. The practical and social difficulties associated with medical imaging of obese patients are an increasingly common problem and it is currently unknown how student and qualified radiographers perceive and respond to these challenges. By better understanding challenges presented in providing quality imaging and care of imaging obese patients, education for both qualified and student radiographers can be enhanced. Radiographers are heavily reliant on visual and tactile senses to locate the position of anatomical structures for diagnostic imaging and determine radiation exposure through a delicate consideration of dose, image quality and anatomical attenuation. However, obese patients require modifications to routine radiographic practice in terms of movement/assisted positioning, equipment capabilities to take increased weight or coverage. These patients may also be subject to compromised radiological diagnosis through poor visualisation of structures. In this paper, the professional and educational literature was narratively reviewed to assess gaps in the evidence base related to the skill and care knowledge for obese patients. Literature was sourced relating to discrete radiographic considerations such as the technical factors of imaging obese patients, exposure and the impact of obesity on imaging departments' service provisions. The recent literature (post-2000 to coincide with the sharp increase in global obesity) on the perceptions of health professionals and student health practitioners has also been explored because there are no specific radiographer studies to report. By understanding the research in similar fields, we may identify what common attitudes qualified and student radiographer's hold and what challenges, technical and care related, can be prepared for.",eng,Journal of medical radiation sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells, and their activity is known to correlate to viral treatment response of HCV. In this study, we investigate the immune effects of viral load decline with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in blood.--NEW SECTION--Twelve patients with chronic HCV were treated with asunaprevir and daclatasvir, and peripheral blood was analyzed at various time points during therapy.--NEW SECTION--In line with previous studies, we confirmed restoration of HCV-specific T-cell frequency upon viral load decline. In addition, we show that serum interferon (IFN)-γ inducible-protein 10, interleukin (IL)-12p40, and IL-18 levels decreased early after start of therapy. Surface expression of activation receptors NKp30, NKp46, and inhibitory receptor NKG2A on blood NK cells reduced during therapy. In addition, the expression of TRAIL on NK cells was reduced during IFN-free therapy, suggesting a decrease in TRAIL-mediated killing by NK cells.--NEW SECTION--We show that viral load decline as a consequence of treatment with novel DAAs in chronic HCV patients reduces serum levels of NK cell-stimulating cytokines and causes correction of the altered NK cell phenotype observed in chronic HCV patients.--NEW SECTION--NCT02282709.",eng,The Journal of infectious diseases,Clinical Trial,2025-04-23,2016

Key events in the development of global health education have included the introduction of a global health intersession mandatory for all first-year students; required pre-departure ethics training for students before all international electives; and the development of a clinical global health elective (Global Health Leadership Program, GHLP). The main challenges to improving global health education for medical students have included securing funding, obtaining institutional support, and developing an interprofessional program that benefits from the resources of the Schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing. Strategies used included objectively demonstrating the need for and barriers to more structured global health experiences; obtaining guidance and modifying existing resources from other institutions and relevant educational websites; and harnessing institution-specific strengths including the large Johns Hopkins global research footprint and existing interprofessional collaborations across the three schools. The Johns Hopkins experience demonstrates that with a supportive administration, students can play an important and effective role in improving global health educational opportunities.

26216042,10.7554/eLife.07616,Mycobacterium ulcerans dynamics in aquatic ecosystems are driven by a complex interplay of abiotic and biotic factors.,"Host-parasite interactions are often embedded within complex host communities and can be influenced by a variety of environmental factors, such as seasonal variations in climate or abiotic conditions in water and soil, which confounds our understanding of the main drivers of many multi-host pathogens. Here, we take advantage of a combination of large environmental data sets on Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), an environmentally persistent microorganism associated to freshwater ecosystems and present in a large variety of aquatic hosts, to characterize abiotic and biotic factors driving the dynamics of this pathogen in two regions of Cameroon. We find that MU dynamics are largely driven by seasonal climatic factors and certain physico-chemical conditions in stagnant and slow-flowing ecosystems, with an important role of pH as limiting factor. Furthermore, water conditions can modify the effect of abundance and diversity of aquatic organisms on MU dynamics, which suggests a different contribution of two MU transmission routes for aquatic hosts (trophic vs environmental transmission) depending on local abiotic factors.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We estimate the lifetime risk of kidney disease in APOL1 dual-risk allele individuals to be at least 15%. Experimental evidence suggests a direct role of APOL1 in pore formation, cellular injury, and programmed cell death in renal injury. The APOL1 BH3 motif, often associated with cell death, is unlikely to play a role in APOL1-induced cytotoxicity because it is not conserved within the APOL family and is dispensable for cell death in vitro. We discuss two models for APOL1 trypanolytic activity: one involving lysosome permeabilization and another involving colloid-osmotic swelling of the cell body, as well as their relevance to human pathophysiology. Experimental evidence from human cell culture models suggests that both mechanisms may be operative. A systems biology approach whereby APOL1-associated perturbations in gene and protein expression in affected individuals are correlated with molecular pathways may be productive to elucidate APOL1 function in vivo.",eng,Seminars in nephrology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26215599,10.1053/j.semperi.2015.06.010,Enculturating science: Community-centric design of behavior change interactions for accelerating health impact.,"Despite significant advancements in the scientific evidence base of interventions to improve newborn survival, we have not yet been able to ""bend the curve"" to markedly accelerate global rates of reduction in newborn mortality. The ever-widening gap between discovery of scientific best practices and their mass adoption by families (the evidence-practice gap) is not just a matter of improving the coverage of health worker-community interactions. The design of the interactions themselves must be guided by sound behavioral science approaches such that they lead to mass adoption and impact at a large scale. The main barrier to the application of scientific approaches to behavior change is our inability to ""unbox"" the ""black box"" of family health behaviors in community settings. The authors argue that these are not black boxes, but in fact thoughtfully designed community systems that have been designed and upheld, and have evolved over many years keeping in mind a certain worldview and a common social purpose. An empathetic understanding of these community systems allows us to deconstruct the causal pathways of existing behaviors, and re-engineer them to achieve desired outcomes. One of the key reasons for the failure of interactions to translate into behavior change is our failure to recognize that the content, context, and process of interactions need to be designed keeping in mind an organized community system with a very different worldview and beliefs. In order to improve the adoption of scientific best practices by communities, we need to adapt them to their culture by leveraging existing beliefs, practices, people, context, and skills. The authors present a systems approach for community-centric design of interactions, highlighting key principles for achieving intrinsically motivated, sustained change in social norms and family health behaviors, elucidated with progressive theories from systems thinking, management sciences, cross-cultural psychology, learning and social cognition, and the behavioral sciences. These are illustrated through a case study of designing effective interactions in Shivgarh, India, that led to rapid and substantial changes in newborn health behaviors and reduction in NMR by half over a span of 16 months.",eng,Seminars in perinatology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The worldwide vaccination programs significantly reduced the number of deaths caused by infectious agents. A successful example was the eradication of smallpox in 1979 after two centuries of vaccination campaigns. Since the first variolation administrations until today, the knowledge on immunology has increased substantially. This knowledge combined with the introduction of cell culture and DNA recombinant technologies revolutionized vaccine design. This review will focus on vaccines against human viral pathogens, recent developments on vaccine design and cell substrates used for their manufacture. While the production of attenuated and inactivated vaccines requires the use of the respective permissible cell substrates, the production of recombinant antigens, virus-like particles, vectored vaccines and chimeric vaccines requires the use - and often the development - of specific cell lines. Indeed, the development of novel modern viral vaccine designs combined with, the stringent safety requirements for manufacture, and the better understanding on animal cell metabolism and physiology are increasing the awareness on the importance of cell line development and engineering areas.

By 2050 those over 65 years old will outnumber children under 15 years of age. This situation will bring with it multifarious variations in health and functional status, occurring with increasing age and which remain incompletely understood. Ageing, however, is not solely a passive degenerative process but one that is actively regulated by distinct molecular pathways. Understanding this molecular basis of ageing is an essential step for therapeutic manipulation to combat age-related disease. Diseases such as SSc, RA and SLE may share common age related pathways of early dysregulation with other diseases of ageing, such that the biomarkers and interventions applied to prevent late stage disease will also tackle common fundamental pathways of ageing processes. This chapter will seek to explore and discuss the possible influence of these factors and their impact on disease processes, with specific reference to SSc in the context of it being a disease of ageing. It will address the contribution of socioeconomic, psychosocial and nutritional confounders of health span through the life course. In particular, it will seek to contextualize the development of inflammatory burden and allostatic overload and their contribution to morbidity and mortality.

The reforms introduced by the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework are ill-suited to providing sufficient levels of access to vaccines to meet the needs of developing states, and as such developing states will continue to be reliant upon the traditional methods of vaccine procurement to procure the majority of the vaccines they required. Using procurement during 2009-H1N1 as a case study, this paper examines the methods of procurement utilised by states in order to determine if the procurement tools available to developing states are sufficient to procure adequate levels of pandemic influenza vaccines. Particular focus is given to the role Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs) play in the procurement process. By exploring this case study it is possible to argue that these procurement methods are ineffective for developing states, and when the next influenza pandemic occurs, demand will once again outstrip supply globally, due to supply of vaccines being dominated by the developed states with APAs in place.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Mycobacterium bovis BCG, the only licensed vaccine available, fails to confer lifelong protection and to prevent reactivation of latent infection. Although 15 new vaccine candidates are now in clinical trials, an effective vaccine against TB remains elusive, and new strategies for vaccination are vital. BCG vaccination fails to induce immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis latency antigens. Synthetic long peptides (SLPs) combined with adjuvants have been studied mostly for therapeutic cancer vaccines, yet not for TB, and proved to induce efficient antitumor immunity. This study investigated an SLP derived from Rv1733c, a major M. tuberculosis latency antigen which is highly expressed by ""dormant"" M. tuberculosis and well recognized by T cells from latently M. tuberculosis-infected individuals. In order to assess its in vivo immunogenicity and protective capacity, Rv1733c SLP in CpG was administered to HLA-DR3 transgenic mice. Immunization with Rv1733c SLP elicited gamma interferon-positive/tumor necrosis factor-positive (IFN-γ(+)/TNF(+)) and IFN-γ(+) CD4(+) T cells and Rv1733c-specific antibodies and led to a significant reduction in the bacterial load in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-challenged mice. This was observed both in a pre- and in a post-M. tuberculosis challenge setting. Moreover, Rv1733c SLP immunization significantly boosted the protective efficacy of BCG, demonstrating the potential of M. tuberculosis latency antigens to improve BCG efficacy. These data suggest a promising role for M. tuberculosis latency antigen Rv1733c-derived SLPs as a novel TB vaccine approach, both in a prophylactic and in a postinfection setting.",eng,Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This study aimed first to search in the English language peer-reviewed literature for reviews of mental health promotion interventions in the Asia-Pacific region. A global rapid review by Barry and colleagues indicated a paucity of publications on this topic in the peer-reviewed literature. The second aim of the study followed from this observation. Two systematic reviews of English language literature were conducted as case studies in two countries with known interest in mental health promotion, Thailand and China. The reviews covered publications in peer-reviewed journals and the ""grey"" literature. In Thailand, the review demonstrated: strong evidence for an empowerment program for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected mothers; a reduction in HIV-related stigma in a community-based program; and a coping program for adolescents. The second review concerned suicide prevention interventions in China. It found one relevant study, a WHO multi-site study of suicide prevention. We found surprisingly little evidence in either country of interventions focused on health equity or modifying the social determinants of mental health. We agree with Barry and colleagues that there is an urgent need to invest in the policy, practice, and research capacity for mental health promotion in LAMICs so that mental health promotion can be incorporated into the wider health promotion and global health development agenda.

These include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Hendra virus, Nipah virus, influenza viruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, and ebola. One Health is the initiative of an inclusive collaboration linking human, animal, and environmental health. One Health is advocated through an intersectoral coordination to combat zoonoses, and the term has evolved over centuries. The primary aim of this literature review was to examine the change in the definition of the term One Health over time, particuarly following the the introduction of the latest definition in 2007 by the American Medical Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association.--NEW SECTION--This review was conducted in four phases. The first phase consisted of a general PubMed search for the phrase ""One Health"" for every literature published up to December 2014. Then an advanced search was carried out using ""One Health"" in conjunction with the terms ""zoonosis"" and ""zoonoses"" in PubMed for the time period between January 2007 and December 2014. The articles found were then categorized based on the type of journals in which the articles were published. For the second phase, ""One Health"" was searched as a Medical subject heading (MeSH) term, which is the National Library of Medicine controlled vocabulary thesaurus used for indexing articles. In the third phase, One Health advocate organizations were found using Google search engine. During the final phase, One Health was searched in Google scholar, examined by Google trends, and analyzed by Google ngram.--NEW SECTION--Before 2007, One Health had many connotations to health in the medical literature with an incomplete adherence to the usage of One Health linking zoonoses. The Google trends analysis shows an overal steady increase of the search of One Health from 2007 to 2014, which is consistent with the findings of articles from Pubmed.--NEW SECTION--Our results indicate that the linkage between the terms One Health and zoonoses started in 2007, which correlates with the joint declaration made by the American Medical Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association in 2007. We suggest creating a MeSH term for One Health in the PubMed database to support more specific research on zoonoses, and exploring the possibility of a patent of the term One Health to support global health and evidence based public health.",eng,Central Asian journal of global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

IAV causes significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly population, due to the ineffectiveness of the vaccine and the alteration of T cell immunity with ageing. The cellular and molecular link between ageing and virus infection is unclear and it is possible that damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) may play a role in the raised severity and susceptibility of virus infections in the elderly. DAMPs which are released from damaged cells following activation, injury or cell death can activate the immune response through the stimulation of the inflammasome through several types of receptors found on the plasma membrane, inside endosomes after endocytosis as well as in the cytosol. In this review, the detriment in the immune system during ageing and the links between influenza virus infection and ageing will be discussed.

However, the ongoing anti-HBV CD8(+) T cell responses in the lymphoid organs are largely unknown due to the infeasibility of obtaining lymphoid organs from CHB patients. Here we demonstrate that the percentage of HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells is higher in the spleen of CHB patients than that from peripheral blood and liver. Although they do respond to TCR stimulation and produce IFNγ, the cells proliferate poorly. Furthermore, miR-720 expression is upregulated in HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells. Overexpression of miR-720 in primary human CD8(+) T cells inhibits TCR stimulation-induced proliferation. We also demonstrate that TGFβ sustains miR-720 upregulation after TCR stimulation, and blood TGFβ levels are associated with the outcome of type I interferon treatment of CHB patients. Thus, therapies targeting miR-720 may help restore impaired immunity in CHB patients.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a complex, T cell-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by immune cell infiltration and chronic inflammation in the islets of Langerhans. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) resulting from insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. The involvement of inflammatory processes, such as immune cell infiltration, and chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of diabetes is less well understood in T2DM than in T1DM. However, studies conducted in the past decade have shown a strong link between inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. They have also shown that chronic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of both T1DM and T2DM. Two immunological factors commonly contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes: the activation of inflammasomes and the release of proinflammatory cytokines in response to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Inflammasomes are intracellular multiprotein molecular platforms. DAMPs act as endogenous danger signals. Here, we review current research on the function(s) of inflammasomes and DAMPs and discuss their pathological relevance and therapeutic implications in diabetes.",eng,Ageing research reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This increasing focus on universal health coverage has brought renewed attention to the role of domestic politics and the interaction between domestic and international relations in the health reform process. This article proposes a theory-based framework for analyzing the politics of health reform for universal health coverage, according to four stages in the policy cycle (agenda setting, design, adoption, and implementation) and four variables that affect reform (interests, institutions, ideas, and ideology). This framework can assist global health policy researchers, multilateral organization officials, and national policy makers in navigating the complex political waters of health reforms aimed at achieving universal health coverage. To derive the framework, we critically review the theoretical and applied literature on health policy reform in developing countries and illustrate the framework with examples of health reforms moving toward universal coverage in low- and middle-income countries. We offer a series of lessons stemming from these experiences to date.",eng,"Journal of health politics, policy and law",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We collected data prospectively and then surveyed a representative sample of 100 alumni (94% response), assessing Program impacts on their careers and collaborations. Frequently, collaborations continued beyond the formal training period with U.S.- (63%) and site-based mentors (66%). U.S. Fellows reported the highest post-training focus on research (88 on a 100-point scale), and the highest Program impact on competitiveness for career or training positions and choices of post-training topics and institutions (95 points). Interest in global health research increased markedly during the training period, especially for LMIC trainees, and was sustained post-training. LMIC alumni reported a significantly higher focus on global health and research than did U.S. alumni.

The experience provided an opportunity to conduct a pilot project in a rural, remote, northern community using an indigenous, global context. Building on the Canadian-Siberian collaboration, the graduate student attended an academic institution in Siberia, where she focused on the sharing of expertise, knowledge, and insights in order to address the challenges facing indigenous people in achieving optimal health and well-being in the circumpolar north. The goal was to create a foundation for ""putting health into place"" in a northern context, with the hope of creating shared learning opportunities for undergraduate students between the 2 countries.The intent is to share the approach used by the graduate student to use a conceptual model to assess the feasibility of creating a context-relevant global health experience for northern nursing education.",eng,Journal of professional nursing : official journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26194157,10.1007/s10728-015-0297-8,Global Health Justice and the Right to Health.,"This paper reflects on Lawrence Gostin's Global Health Law. In so doing seeks to contribute to the debate about how global health justice is best conceived and achieved. Gostin's vision of global health is one which is communal and in which health is directly connected to other justice concerns. Hence the need for health-in-all policies, and the importance of focusing on basic and communal health goods rather than high-tech and individual ones. This paper asks whether this broadly communal vision of global health justice is best served by making the right to health central to the project. It explores a number of reasons why rights-talk might be problematic in the context of health justice; namely, structurally, rights are individual and state-centric and politically, they are oppositional and better suited to single-issue campaigns. The paper argues that stripping rights of their individualist assumptions is difficult, and perhaps impossible, and hence alternative approaches, such as those Gostin endorses based on global public goods and health security, might deliver much, perhaps most, global health goods, while avoiding the problems of rights-talk.",eng,Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiologic agent of tuberculosis, is an intracellular pathogen of mononuclear phagocytes. As such, it is an ideal pathogen for nanotherapeutics because macrophages avidly ingest nanoparticles even without specific targeting molecules. Hence, a nanoparticle drug delivery system has the potential to target and deliver high concentrations of drug directly into M. tuberculosis-infected cells-greatly enhancing efficacy while avoiding off-target toxicities. Stimulus-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles of two different sizes, 100 and 50 nm, are developed as carriers for the major anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid in a prodrug configuration. The drug is captured by the aldehyde-functionalized nanoparticle via hydrazone bond formation and coated with poly(ethylene imine)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEI-PEG). The drug is released from the nanoparticles in response to acidic pH at levels that naturally occur within acidified endolysosomes. It is demonstrated that isoniazid-loaded PEI-PEG-coated nanoparticles are avidly ingested by M. tuberculosis-infected human macrophages and kill the intracellular bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. It is further demonstrated in a mouse model of pulmonary tuberculosis that the nanoparticles are well tolerated and much more efficacious than an equivalent amount of free drug.",eng,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

These features allow their functional properties to be compared, with the goal of broadly applying the knowledge acquired from studying specific viral polymerases to other viral polymerases about which less is known. Here we review the structural and functional properties of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) in order to understand the fundamental processes underlying the replication of viral genomes.

However, the exact meaning of global public health is still unclear, resulting in varied curricula and teaching units among universities. The contextual differences between high- and low- and middle-income countries, and the process of globalization need to be taken into account while developing any global public health course. Global public health and public health are not separable and global public health often appears as an extension of public health in the era of globalization and interdependence. Though global public health is readily understood as health of global population, it is mainly practiced as health problems and their solutions set within low- and middle-income countries. Additional specialist competencies relevant to the context of low- and middle-income countries are needed to work in this field. Although there can be a long list of competencies relevant to this broad topic, available literature suggests that knowledge and skills related with ethics and vulnerable groups/issues; globalization and its impact on health; disease burden; culture, society, and politics; and management are important.",eng,Frontiers in public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Control patients, aged 11-17 years, were recruited from the stone clinic. Exclusion criteria were lack of English fluency, insufficient reading skills, or an incontinent fecal diversion. A 29-item version of the Adolescent Fecal Incontinence and Constipation Symptom Index (A-FICSI) was developed with five domains (Figure). Test re-test reliability and correlation with the total global health-related QOL score from the Parkin survey were measured using the Pearson correlation coefficient. A factor analysis model with four-fold correlations was tested.--NEW SECTION--Of the 65 study-eligible individuals approached, 25 (11 boys) completed the A-FICSI (median age 12.6 years, IQR 11.8-14.7 years) and 17 completed another survey on urinary incontinence (64.6% response rate). Twenty-one control patients with nephrolithiasis completed the A-FICSI. Nine of the 25 completed a second administration of the survey. The mean correlation between repeated administrations of the survey was r = 0.43. There was a significant negative correlation between severity of constipation (r = -0.299, p < 0.05) and severity of FI (r = -0.316, p < 0.05) with the total Parkin QOL score. The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) was 0.864. Most items loaded significantly on their respective factors. Between-factor correlations were all significant (>0.30) in the predicted direction. Unstandardized residuals were 8.7% (95% CI 6.4-10.9%). Item reduction was performed on the 29-item instrument based on results of the factor analysis. The finalized instrument contained 21 items.--NEW SECTION--This is the first adolescent-reported bowel dysfunction instrument to undergo formal psychometric assessment in the spina bifida population. The instrument demonstrated adequate reliability and the five-factor structure fit the data well. This study highlights the negative impact of bowel dysfunction on the QOL of spina bifida patients. It is limited by the moderate sample size that is a common issue in relatively rare diseases.--NEW SECTION--The A-FICSI possesses desirable psychometric properties for the measurement of bowel dysfunction in the spina bifida population.",eng,Journal of pediatric urology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Early diagnosis and intervention strategies may reduce the impact of cirrhosis; however, it can be difficult for initial point-of-care health care providers to identify and refer patients with cirrhosis due to lack of knowledge and resources. This review examines current diagnostic strategies for cirrhosis and cirrhosis-related complications and the potential benefits of multidisciplinary care for patients with the disorder.--NEW SECTION--A PubMed search of the medical literature was conducted to identify current diagnostic methods and standards and ascertain the impact of multidisciplinary care on patients with cirrhosis.--NEW SECTION--Screening of patients at risk for cirrhosis has been recommended by several professional and governmental organizations. Unfortunately, identification of early-stage cirrhosis remains challenging despite development of novel calculations for risk (eg, aspartate transaminase-to-platelet count ratio) that use values from common, noninvasive laboratory tests to determine the extent of liver disease. Abnormal liver function test results and alterations in serum liver enzyme markers (eg, alanine and aspartate transaminases) may suggest cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease; however, they are not definitive. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis and staging of cirrhosis, but its cost, invasiveness, and risk of complications have prompted the development of noninvasive tests (eg, elastography). Primary care physicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of cirrhosis-related complications, particularly portal hypertension, and refer patients to specialists for further evaluation when warranted.--NEW SECTION--Patients at risk for cirrhosis should be screened and the underlying etiologic factor(s) of the liver disease treated or appropriately managed when possible. Primary care physicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of cirrhosis and its related complications and adopt a low threshold for referral to a specialist when the condition is suspected.

We aimed to develop the argument that management - defined here as the process of achieving predetermined objectives through human, financial, and technical resources - is a cross-cutting function necessary for success in all World Health Organization (WHO) building blocks of health systems strengthening. Management within health systems is particularly critical in low-income settings where the efficient use of scarce resources is paramount to attaining health goals. More generally, investments in management capacity may be viewed as a key leverage point in grand strategy, as strong management enables the achievement of large ends with limited means. We also sought to delineate a set of core competencies and identify key roles to be targeted for management capacity building efforts. Several effective examples of management interventions have been described in the research literature. Together, the existing evidence underscores the importance of country ownership of management capacity building efforts, which often challenge the status quo and thus need country leadership to sustain despite inevitable friction. The literature also recognizes that management capacity efforts, as a key ingredient of effective systems change, take time to embed, as new protocols and ways of working become habitual and integrated as standard operating procedures. Despite these challenges, the field of health management as part of global health system strengthening efforts holds promise as a fundamental leverage point for achieving health system performance goals with existing human, technical, and financial resources. The evidence base consistently supports the role of management in performance improvement but would benefit from additional research with improved methodological rigor and longer-time horizon investigations. Meanwhile, greater emphasis on management as a critical element of global health efforts may open new and sustainable avenues for advancing health systems performance.",eng,International journal of health policy and management,Editorial,2025-04-23,2015

We quantified the nutritional and health outcomes associated with decreased intake of pollinator-dependent foods for populations around the world.--NEW SECTION--We assembled a database of supplies of 224 types of food in 156 countries. We quantified nutrient composition and pollinator dependence of foods to estimate the size of possible reductions in micronutrient and food intakes for different national populations, while keeping calorie intake constant with replacement by staple foods. We estimated pollinator-decline-dependent changes in micronutrient-deficient populations using population-weighted estimated average requirements and the cutpoint method. We estimated disease burdens of non-communicable, communicable, and malnutrition-related diseases with the Global Burden of Disease 2010 comparative risk assessment framework.--NEW SECTION--Assuming complete removal of pollinators, 71 million (95% uncertainty interval 41-262) people in low-income countries could become newly deficient in vitamin A, and an additional 2.2 billion (1.2-2.5) already consuming below the average requirement would have further declines in vitamin A supplies. Corresponding estimates for folate were 173 million (134-225) and 1.23 billion (1.12-1.33). A 100% decline in pollinator services could reduce global fruit supplies by 22.9% (19.5-26.1), vegetables by 16.3% (15.1-17.7), and nuts and seeds by 22.1% (17.7-26.4), with significant heterogeneity by country. In sum, these dietary changes could increase global deaths yearly from non-communicable and malnutrition-related diseases by 1.42 million (1.38-1.48) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by 27.0 million (25.8-29.1), an increase of 2.7% for deaths and 1.1% for DALYs.

We examined factors that have shaped priority for global surgical care.--NEW SECTION--We undertook semi-structured interviews by telephone with members of global surgical networks and ministries of health to explore the challenges and opportunities surgeons, anaesthesiologists, and other proponents face in increasing global priority for surgery. We did a literature review and collected information from reports from organisations involved in surgery. We used a policy framework consisting of four categories-actor power, ideas, political contexts, and characteristics of the issue itself-to analyse factors that have shaped global political priority for surgery. We did a thematic analysis on the collected information.--NEW SECTION--Several factors hinder the acquisition of attention and resources for global surgery. With respect to actor power, the global surgery community is fragmented, does not have unifying leadership, and is missing guiding institutions. Regarding ideas, community members disagree on how to address and publicly position the problem. With respect to political contexts, the community has made insufficient efforts to capitalise on political opportunities such as the Millennium Development Goals. Regarding issue characteristics, data on the burden of surgical diseases are limited and public misperceptions surrounding the cost and complexity of surgery are widespread. However, the community has several strengths that portend well for the acquisition of political support. These include the existence of networks deeply committed to the cause, the potential to link with global health priorities, and emerging research on the cost-effectiveness of some procedures.--NEW SECTION--To improve global priority for surgery, proponents will need to create an effective governance structure that facilitates achievement of collective goals, generate consensus on solutions, and find an effective public positioning of the issue that attracts political support.--NEW SECTION--None.",eng,The Lancet.

In non-endemic areas, few countries are aware of the emergence of this new disease and have established changes in their health systems. To address this new public health challenge, the priorities should be control programs to avoid new cases of T. cruzi infection acquired through vertical transmission, blood transfusion or organ transplant.

Few studies have examined neighborhood perceptions related to walking and cycling for transport in different countries. Therefore, it is challenging to prioritize appropriate built-environment interventions.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this study was to examine the strength and shape of the relationship between adults' neighborhood perceptions and walking and cycling for transport across diverse environments.--NEW SECTION--As part of the International Physical activity and Environment Network (IPEN) adult project, self-reported data were taken from 13,745 adults (18-65 years) living in physically and socially diverse neighborhoods in 17 cities across 12 countries. Neighborhood perceptions were measured using the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale, and walking and cycling for transport were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form. Generalized additive mixed models were used to model walking or cycling for transport during the last seven days with neighborhood perceptions. Interactions by city were explored.--NEW SECTION--Walking-for-transport outcomes were significantly associated with perceived residential density, land use mix-access, street connectivity, aesthetics, and safety. Any cycling for transport was significantly related to perceived land use mix-access, street connectivity, infrastructure, aesthetics, safety, and perceived distance to destinations. Between-city differences existed for some attributes in relation to walking or cycling for transport.--NEW SECTION--Many perceived environmental attributes supported both cycling and walking; however, highly walkable environments may not support cycling for transport.

However, there is a consensus among the global health community, supported by mathematical modelling, that onchocerciasis in Africa will not be eliminated within proposed time frameworks in all endemic foci with only annual MDA, and novel and alternative strategies are urgently needed. Furthermore, use of MDA with ivermectin is already compromised in large areas of central Africa co-endemic with Loa loa, and there are areas where suboptimal or atypical responses to ivermectin have been documented. An onchocerciasis vaccine would be highly advantageous in these areas.--NEW SECTION--We used a previously developed onchocerciasis transmission model (EPIONCHO) to investigate the impact of vaccination in areas where loiasis and onchocerciasis are co-endemic and ivermectin is contraindicated. We also explore the potential influence of a vaccination programme on infection resurgence in areas where local elimination has been successfully achieved. Based on the age range included in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), the vaccine was assumed to target 1 to 5 year olds. Our modelling results indicate that the deployment of an onchocerciasis vaccine would have a beneficial impact in onchocerciasis-loiasis co-endemic areas, markedly reducing microfilarial load in the young (under 20 yr) age groups.--NEW SECTION--An onchocerciasis prophylactic vaccine would reduce the onchocerciasis disease burden in populations where ivermectin cannot be administered safely. Moreover, a vaccine could substantially decrease the chance of re-emergence of Onchocerca volvulus infection in areas where it is deemed that MDA with ivermectin can be stopped. Therefore, a vaccine would protect the substantial investments made by present and past onchocerciasis control programmes, decreasing the chance of disease recrudescence and offering an important additional tool to mitigate the potentially devastating impact of emerging ivermectin resistance.",eng,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This study was designed to determine changes in cardiopulmonary functions after aerobic and anaerobic exercise training in obese subjects. [Subjects and Methods] Forty obese subjects, whose ages ranged between 18 and 25 years, were divided into 2 equal groups: group A received aerobic exercise training in addition to dietary measures, and group B received anaerobic exercise training for 3 months in addition to dietary measures. Measurements of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, maximum voluntary ventilation, maximal oxygen consumption, and body mass index were obtained for both groups before and after the exercise program. [Results] The mean body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and maximal oxygen consumption decreased significantly, whereas the mean maximum voluntary ventilation increased significantly after treatment in group A. The mean maximum voluntary ventilation also increased significantly after treatment in group B. There were significant differences between the mean levels of the investigated parameters in groups A and B after treatment.

Because scores on different global health measures are not comparable, comparative effectiveness research (CER) is challenging.--NEW SECTION--To establish a common reporting metric so that the physical and mental health scores on the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12 (©) ) can be converted into scores on the corresponding Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(®)) Global Health scores.--NEW SECTION--Following a single-sample linking design, participants from an Internet panel completed items from the PROMIS Global Health and VR-12 Health Survey. A common metric was created using analyses based on item response theory (IRT), producing score cross-walk tables for the mental and physical health components of each measure. The linking relationships were evaluated by calculating the standard deviation of differences between the observed and linked PROMIS scores and estimating confidence intervals by sample size.--NEW SECTION--Participants (N = 2025) were 49 % male and 73 % white; mean age was 46 years.--NEW SECTION--Mental and physical health subscales of the PROMIS Global Health and the VR-12. The mean VR-12 physical component and mental component scores were 45.2 and 46.6, respectively; the mean PROMIS physical and mental health scores were 48.3 and 48.5, respectively.--NEW SECTION--We found evidence that the combined set of VR-12 and PROMIS items were relatively unidimensional and that we could proceed with linking. Linking worked better between the physical health than mental health scores using VR-12 item responses (vs. linking based on algorithmic scores). For each of the cross-walks, users can minimize the impact of linking error with modest increases in sample sizes.--NEW SECTION--VR-12 scores can be expressed on the PROMIS Global Health metric to facilitate the evaluation of treatment, including CER. Extending these results to other common measures of global health is encouraged.",eng,Journal of general internal medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In this Health Policy, we use the International Development Statistics databases to quantify donor support for such functions. We classify donor funding for health into aid for global functions (provision of global public goods, management of cross-border externalities, and fostering of leadership and stewardship) versus country-specific aid. We use a new measure of donor funding that combines official development assistance (ODA) for health with additional donor spending on research and development (R&D) for diseases of poverty. Much R&D spending falls outside ODA--ie, the assistance that is conventionally reported through ODA databases of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This expanded definition, which we term health ODA plus, provides a more comprehensive picture of donor support for health that could reshape how policy makers will approach their support for global health.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The objective of this research is to systematically review the literature and determine the risk of fetal, neonatal and maternal death associated with cholera during pregnancy.--NEW SECTION--Medline, Global Health Library, and Cochrane Library databases were searched using the key terms cholera and pregnancy for articles published in any language and at any time before August 2013 to quantitatively summarize estimates of fetal, maternal, and neonatal mortality. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each selected study. Random-effect non-linear logistic regression was used to calculate pooled rates and 95% CIs by time period. Studies from the recent period (1991-2013) were compared with studies from 1969-1990. Relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% CIs were obtained by comparing mortality of selected recent studies with published national normative data from the closest year.--NEW SECTION--The meta-analysis included seven studies that together involved 737 pregnant women with cholera from six countries. The pooled fetal death rate for 4 studies during 1991-2013 was 7.9% (95% CIs 5.3-10.4), significantly lower than that of 3 studies from 1969-1990 (31.0%, 95% CIs 25.2-36.8). There was no difference in fetal death rate by trimester. The pooled neonatal death rate for 1991-2013 studies was 0.8% (95% CIs 0.0-1.6), and 6.4% (95% CIs 0.0-20.8) for 1969-1990. The pooled maternal death rate for 1991-2013 studies was 0.2% (95% CIs 0.0-0.7), and 5.0% (95% CIs 0.0-16.0) for 1969-1990. Compared with published national mortality estimates, the RR for fetal death of 5.8 (95% CIs 2.9-11.3) was calculated for Haiti (2013), 1.8 (95% CIs 0.3-10.4) for Senegal (2007), and 2.6 (95% CIs 0.5-14.9) for Peru (1991); there were no significant differences in the RR for neonatal or maternal death.--NEW SECTION--Results are limited by the inconsistencies found across included studies but suggest that maternal cholera is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly fetal death.

Iron and copper deficiencies have their most profound effect on the developing fetus/infant, leading to brain development deficits and poor cognitive outcomes. Tissue iron depletion or chronic anemia can induce cellular hypoxic signaling. In mice, chronic hypoxia induces a compensatory increase in brain blood vessel outgrowth. We hypothesized that developmental anemia, due to iron or copper deficiencies, induces angiogenesis/vasculogenesis in the neonatal brain.--NEW SECTION--To test our hypothesis, three independent experiments were performed where pregnant rats were fed iron- or copper-deficient diets from gestational day 2 through mid-lactation. Effects on the neonatal brain vasculature were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess mRNA levels of angiogenesis/vasculogenesis-associated genes and GLUT1 immunohistochemistry to assess brain blood vessel density and complexity.--NEW SECTION--Iron deficiency, but not copper deficiency, increased mRNA expression of brain endothelial cell- and angiogenesis/vasculogenesis-associated genes (i.e. Glut1, Vwf, Vegfa, Ang2, Cxcl12, and Flk1) in the neonatal brain, suggesting increased cerebrovascular density. Iron deficiency also increased hippocampal and cerebral cortical blood vessel branching by 62 and 78%, respectively.--NEW SECTION--This study demonstrates increased blood vessel complexity in the neonatal iron-deficient brain, which is likely due to elevated angiogenic/vasculogenic signaling. At least initially, this is probably an adaptive response to maintain metabolic substrate homeostasis in the developing iron-deficient brain. However, this may also contribute to long-term neurodevelopmental deficits.",eng,Nutritional neuroscience,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The standard short course regimen is highly effective against TB, but requires multiple TB-specific drugs and a long treatment duration. Recent studies using late-generation fluoroquinolones and/or high-dose rifapentine-containing regimens to shorten the duration of TB treatment showed negative results. Extending the treatment duration may be considered in patients with cavitation on the initial chest radiograph and positivity in sputum culture at 2 months of treatment for preventing TB relapse. Current evidence does not support the use of fixed-dose combinations compared to separate drugs for the purpose of improving treatment outcomes. All patients receiving TB treatment should be monitored regularly for response to therapy, facilitation of treatment completion, and management of adverse drug reactions.

Since the first reported EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, several small outbreaks have been reported in central Africa with about 2,400 cases occurring between 1976 and 2013. The 2013-2015 EVD outbreak in west Africa is the first documented outbreak in this region and the largest ever with over 27,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths. Although EVD transmission rates have recently decreased in west Africa, this crisis continues to threaten global health and security, particularly since infected travelers could spread EVD to other resource-limited areas of the world. Because vaccines and drugs are not yet licensed for EVD, outbreak control is dependent on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., infection control practices, isolation of EVD cases, contact tracing with follow-up and quarantine, sanitary burial, health education). However, delays in diagnosing and reporting EVD cases in less accessible rural areas continue to hamper control efforts. New advances in rapid diagnostics for identifying presumptive EVD cases and in mobile-based technologies for communicating critical health-related information should facilitate deployment of an early response to prevent the amplification of sporadic EVD cases into large-scale outbreaks.",eng,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26173827,10.1113/jphysiol.2014.278317,A mathematical model of salt-sensitive hypertension: the neurogenic hypothesis.,"Salt sensitivity of arterial pressure (salt-sensitive hypertension) is a serious global health issue. The causes of salt-sensitive hypertension are extremely complex and mathematical models can elucidate potential mechanisms that are experimentally inaccessible. Until recently, the only mathematical model for long-term control of arterial pressure was the model of Guyton and Coleman; referred to as the G-C model. The core of this model is the assumption that sodium excretion is driven by renal perfusion pressure, the so-called 'renal function curve'. Thus, the G-C model dictates that all forms of hypertension are due to a primary shift of the renal function curve to a higher operating pressure. However, several recent experimental studies in a model of hypertension produced by the combination of a high salt intake and administration of angiotensin II, the AngII-salt model, are inconsistent with the G-C model. We developed a new mathematical model that does not limit the cause of salt-sensitive hypertension solely to primary renal dysfunction. The model is the first known mathematical counterexample to the assumption that all salt-sensitive forms of hypertension require a primary shift of renal function: we show that in at least one salt-sensitive form of hypertension the requirement is not necessary. We will refer to this computational model as the 'neurogenic model'. In this Symposium Review we discuss how, despite fundamental differences between the G-C model and the neurogenic model regarding mechanisms regulating sodium excretion and vascular resistance, they generate similar haemodynamic profiles of AngII-salt hypertension. In addition, the steady-state relationships between arterial pressure and sodium excretion, a correlation that is often erroneously presented as the 'renal function curve', are also similar in both models. Our findings suggest that salt-sensitive hypertension is not due solely to renal dysfunction, as predicted by the G-C model, but may also result from neurogenic dysfunction.",eng,The Journal of physiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Complete wound healing was the primary outcome assessed; secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life, adverse events, resource use and dressing performance.--NEW SECTION--We found 13 eligible systematic reviews relevant to this overview that contained a total of 17 relevant RCTs. One review reported the results of a network meta-analysis and so presented information on indirect, as well as direct, treatment effects. Collectively the reviews reported findings for 11 different comparisons supported by direct data and 26 comparisons supported by indirect data only. Only four comparisons informed by direct data found evidence of a difference in wound healing between dressing types, but the evidence was assessed as being of low or very low quality (in one case data could not be located and checked).

Tuberculosis remains a global health problem as smear is positive in only 50% cases and culture methods require time. In such a context, genotypic diagnostic tools such as Xpert® MTB/RIF gained interest. This rapid and simple-to-use nucleic acid amplification test allows a diagnosis in two hours and prevents further invasive investigations in pulmonary and mediastinal tuberculosis. Because of its low sensitivity, it cannot be used in pleural fluid. Indirect immunologic tests are of no use to diagnose active tuberculosis disease. Another current area of interest is the emergence of resistant tuberculosis. In France, approximately 100 cases of multidrug resistant tuberculosis and a few extensively drug resistant tuberculosis have been reported in 2014. Even though these forms of tuberculosis are imported, it is crucial to identify hazardous situations and to optimize care of these patients. Xpert® MTB/RIF is again of marked interest here as it detects rifampin resistance with a 95% sensitivity and a 98% specificity. Interpretation of genotypic tests such as Genotype® MTBDR or Xpert® MTB/RIF depends on known detected mutations, although they do not always have a clinical or phenotypic expression.

The traditional, trivalent influenza vaccines have limited efficacy because of rapid antigenic evolution of the circulating viruses. This antigenic variability mediates viral escape from the host immune responses, necessitating annual vaccine updates. Influenza vaccines elicit a protective antibody response, primarily targeting the viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA). However, the predominant humoral response is against the hypervariable head domain of HA, thereby restricting the breadth of protection. In contrast, the conserved, subdominant stem domain of HA is a potential ""universal"" vaccine candidate. We designed an HA stem-fragment immunogen from the 1968 pandemic H3N2 strain (A/Hong Kong/1/68) guided by a comprehensive H3 HA sequence conservation analysis. The biophysical properties of the designed immunogen were further improved by C-terminal fusion of a trimerization motif, ""isoleucine-zipper"", or ""foldon"".

A total of 134 of the 147 total cases performed (91.2%) were educational cases, in which the Fellow operated with and trained one or more of the following: American medical students, American residents, Haitian residents, or Haitian staff surgeons.--NEW SECTION--The Global Surgery Fellowship model overcomes many of the traditional challenges to providing adequate surgical care in resource-poor countries. Specifically, it meets the challenge of providing a broad educational experience for many levels of local and foreign physicians, while working within an established locally run health care system. We believe that this model is generalizable to many resource-poor hospitals with permanent local staff that are open to collaboration.",eng,Journal of pediatric surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Of these individuals, 15-20 million are co-infected with hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Progress toward curative therapies has been impeded by the highly restricted host tropism of HBV, which is limited to productive infections in humans and chimpanzees. Here, we will discuss different approaches that have been taken to study HBV and HDV infections in vivo. The development of transgenic and humanized mice has lead to deeper insights into HBV pathogenesis. An improved understanding of the determinants governing HBV and HDV species tropism will aid in the construction of a small animal model with inheritable susceptible to HBV/HDV.",eng,Current opinion in virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

QoL after sphincter-preserving anterior resection (AR), however, was found nonsuperior to abdominoperineal resection. The aim of our study was to evaluate QoL after AR compared with colon cancer patients after right hemicolectomy (CC) and healthy lay persons without history of cancer (HL) in long-term follow-up.--NEW SECTION--Consecutive alive RC patients (n = 293) who received an AR between 1998 and 2008 were included. CC patients (n = 201) and HL of the same age were used as a surgical and a nonsurgical control group, respectively. QoL was assessed using European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires QLQ-C 30 and -CR 38.--NEW SECTION--Questionnaires from 116 RC patients, 105 CC patients, and 103 HL were evaluable with a median time after surgery of 5 years. The global health status did not differ. Social functioning, future perspectives, and financial difficulties tended to poorer scores in the cancer groups. Physical functioning was better in RC and CC patients compared with HL. Defecation problems and diarrhea were more frequent in RC patients (P < .05). An additional open question revealed a median stool frequency of 3, 2, and 1 per day for RC, CC, and HL, respectively. Defecation problems were more frequent in RC patients who received radiation therapy (P < .05).--NEW SECTION--Diarrhea and defecation problems impaired QoL after AR for RC, which was worsened after radiation therapy. To improve QoL of RC patients in the future, physicians have to focus on minimization of gastrointestinal side effects while optimizing surgical reconstruction.",eng,Clinical colorectal cancer,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

Trypanosoma cruzi infection has a highly variable clinical course, ranging from complete absence of symptoms to severe and often fatal cardiovascular and/or gastrointestinal manifestations. To date, few correlates of clinical disease progression have been identified. Elucidating a putative role for T. cruzi strain diversity in Chagas disease pathogenesis is complicated by the scarcity of parasites in clinical specimens and the limitations of our contemporary genotyping techniques. This article systematically reviews the historical literature, given our current understanding of parasite genetic diversity, to evaluate the evidence for any association between T. cruzi genotype and chronic clinical outcome, risk of congenital transmission or reactivation and orally transmitted outbreaks.",eng,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In survival benefit analyses, transplantation status was modeled as a time-varying covariate.--NEW SECTION--The cohort comprised 19,242 kidney transplantation candidates (median age, 51 years; 36% black race) receiving maintenance dialysis. Candidates in the lowest baseline Physical Functioning score quartile were more likely to be inactivated (adjusted HR vs highest quartile, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.21-1.39) and less likely to undergo transplantation (adjusted HR vs highest quartile, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.61-0.68). After transplantation, worse Physical Functioning score was associated with shorter 3-year survival (84% vs 92% for the lowest vs highest function quartiles). However, compared to dialysis, transplantation was associated with a statistically significant survival benefit by 9 months for patients in every function quartile.--NEW SECTION--Functional status is self-reported.--NEW SECTION--Even patients with low function appear to live longer with kidney transplantation versus dialysis.

Low bone mineral density (BMD) increases susceptibility to fractures. This review aimed to assess whether urbanicity is consistently associated with lower BMD globally.--NEW SECTION--Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Global Health (-April 2013) were searched for articles investigating differences in bone mineral content (BMC) or BMD between urban and rural areas. Ratio of means (RoM) of BMD were used to estimate effect sizes in meta-analysis, with an exception for one study that only presented BMC data.--NEW SECTION--Fifteen articles from eleven distinct populations were included in the review; seven populations from four high income countries and four from three low and middle income countries (LMIC). Meta-analysis showed conflicting evidence for urban-rural difference in BMD; studies from high income countries generally showed higher BMD in rural areas while the results were more mixed in studies from low and middle income countries (HIC RoM = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.06; LMIC RoM = -0.04: 95% CI: -0.1 to 0.01).--NEW SECTION--Urban-rural differences of bone mineral density may be context-specific.

In this Opinion, we present the rationale for promulgating an ""Essential Diagnostics List."" Additionally, we explain the ways in which adopting a vision for ""Health in All Policies"" could link essential diagnostics with robust and timely societal outcomes such as sustainable development, human rights, gender parity, and alleviation of poverty. We do so in three ways. First, we propose the need for a new, ""see through"" taxonomy for knowledge-based innovation as we transition from the material industries (e.g., textiles, plastic, cement, glass) dominant in the 20(th) century to the anticipated knowledge industry of the 21st century. If knowledge is the currency of the present century, then it is sensible to adopt an approach that thoroughly examines scientific knowledge, starting with the production aims, methods, quality, distribution, access, and the ends it purports to serve. Second, we explain that this knowledge trajectory focus on innovation is crucial and applicable across all sectors, including public, private, or public-private partnerships, as it underscores the fact that scientific knowledge is a co-product of technology, human values, and social systems. By making the value systems embedded in scientific design and knowledge co-production transparent, we all stand to benefit from sustainable and transparent science. Third, we appeal to the global health community to consider the necessary qualities of good governance for 21st century organizations that will embark on developing essential diagnostics.

Waterpipe smoking is among the most popular methods of tobacco consumption worldwide. In this study, we investigated whether waterpipe smoking impairs learning and memory in the hippocampus, a question of special concern due to the particular popularity of waterpipe use among youth. Additionally, possible molecular targets for expected learning and memory impairment were determined. In this study, rats were exposed to waterpipe smoke (WTS) by whole body exposure 1 h × 5 days/week, for 1 month, and outcomes were compared to a control group exposed only to fresh air. Outcomes included spatial learning and memory using the radial arm water maze (RAWM) and oxidative stress biomarkers (catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), GSH/GSSG ratio). We found that WTS exposure led to impaired short- and long-term memory. This impairment was accompanied by reduced hippocampal activity of catalase, SOD, GPx, GSH, and GSH/GSSG, elevated GSSG, thus marked changes in oxidative stress biomarkers. In conclusion, there is reason for concern that WTS exposure may impair cognitive ability.",eng,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Given the lack of effective pharmaceutical treatment for common types of dementia including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, research interest in lifestyle modifications that could prevent, postpone the clinical syndrome or decelerate progression of dementia is growing. Among the various dietary patterns that were tested for their effects on cognition, the traditional Mediterranean diet (MeDi) has shown promising results. This review aims to summarize the epidemiological evidence on the effects of MeDi on the prevention of dementia, presenting data from cross-sectional as well as longitudinal observational studies conducted both in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries. These findings have been also reproduced in the context of one recent randomized-controlled clinical trial. Postulated mechanisms of action that may account for the potential protective effect of MeDi on cognitive impairment will be briefly discussed. Despite the fact that the link between MeDi and cognitive decline has been only explored for less than a decade, data on efficacy is rapidly increasing and allows optimism that MeDi could emerge as an alternative prophylactic treatment for dementia.",eng,Current Alzheimer research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In response, stakeholders at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, and the Hospital General de Tijuana (HGT) implemented a transcultural partnership to establish a pediatric oncology program. The aim was to improve clinical outcomes and overall survival for children in Baja California. An initial needs assessment evaluation was performed and a culturally sensitive, comprehensive, 5-year plan was designed and implemented. After six years, healthcare system accomplishments include the establishment of a fully functional pediatric oncology unit with 60 new healthcare providers (vs. five in 2007). Patient outcome improvements include a rise in 5-year survival for leukemia from 10 to 43%, a rise in new cases diagnosed per year from 21 to 70, a reduction in the treatment abandonment rate from 10% to 2%, and a 45% decrease in the infection rate. More than 600 patients have benefited from this program. Knowledge sharing has taken place between teams at the HGT and Rady Children's Hospital San Diego. Further, one of the most significant outcomes is that the HGT has transitioned into a regional referral center and now mentors other hospitals in Mexico. Our results show that collaborative initiatives that implement long-term partnerships along the United States-Mexico border can effectively build local capacity and reduce the survival gap between children with cancer in the two nations.

Each MBL gene is located on specific genetic elements including integrons, transposons, plasmids, or on the chromosome, in which they carry genes encoding determinants of resistance to carbapenems and other antibiotics, conferring multidrug resistance to P. aeruginosa. In addition, these genetic elements are transferable to other Gram-negative species, increasing the antimicrobial resistance rate and complicating the treatment of infected patients. Therefore, it is essential to understand the epidemiology, resistance mechanism, and molecular characteristics of MPPA for infection control and prevention of a possible global health crisis.

It disproportionately affects sub-Saharan Africans, particularly young children. In an effort to improve disease management, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended in 2010 that countries test children younger than age five who present with suspected malaria fever to confirm the diagnosis instead of treating them presumptively with antimalarial drugs. Costs and concerns about the overall health impact of such diagnostic testing for malaria in children remain barriers to full implementation. Using data from national Malaria Indicator Surveys, we estimated two-stage microsimulation models for Angola, Tanzania, and Uganda to assess the policy's cost-effectiveness. We found that diagnostic testing for malaria in children younger than five is cost-saving in Angola. In Tanzania and Uganda the cost per life-year gained is $5.54 and $94.28, respectively. The costs projected for Tanzania and Uganda are less than the WHO standard of $150 per life-year gained. Our results were robust under varying assumptions about cost, prevalence of malaria, and behavior, and they strongly suggest the pursuit of policies that facilitate full implementation of testing for malaria in children younger than five.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, the relationship between health aid and the expected health improvements from those expenditures--the cost-effectiveness of targeted interventions--remains unknown. We reviewed the literature for cost-effectiveness of interventions targeting five disease categories: HIV; malaria; tuberculosis; noncommunicable diseases; and maternal, newborn, and child health. We measured the alignment between health aid and cost-effectiveness, and we examined the possibility of better alignment by simulating health aid reallocation. The relationship between health aid and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios is negative and significant: More health aid is going to disease categories with more cost-effective interventions. Changing the allocation of health aid earmarked funding could lead to greater health gains even without expanding overall disbursements. The greatest improvements in the alignment would be achieved by reallocating some aid from HIV or maternal, newborn, and child health to malaria or TB. We conclude that health aid is generally aligned with cost-effectiveness considerations, but in some countries this alignment could be improved.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26153141,10.1002/wnan.1359,Engineering immunity in the mucosal niche against sexually transmitted infections.,"The mucosal surfaces of the genital tract are the site of entry to over 30 different bacterial, parasitic, and viral pathogens that are the cause of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. Women and adolescent girls are more severely impacted by STIs than men due in part to a greater biological susceptibility for acquiring infections and differences in disease sequelae. While it is widely accepted that preventative vaccines against the most commonly transmitted STIs would have a major impact on decreasing the global health burden of STIs for women worldwide, several challenges preclude their development. The female genital tract is a complex niche of microflora, hormonal influences, and immune tissues and cells that result in a mucosal immune system that is distinct from other mucosal sites and from our systemic immune system. An appreciation of these differences and their effect on shaping mucosal immunity to sexually transmitted pathogens is an important determinant for the design of effective STI vaccines. Here we describe the anatomy and mucosal immune system of the female reproductive tract, and discuss bioengineering strategies to design mucosal vaccines that overcome delivery challenges and coordinate the presentation kinetics and compartmentalization of antigens and adjuvants to relevant mucosal immune cell subsets. In particular, we describe recent progress in understanding the role of specific mucosal dendritic cell subsets in facilitating immune responses to pathogenic microbes in the genital mucosa. We also discuss the development of pathogen-mimicking materials that may be useful for engineering protective immunity in this mucosal niche.",eng,Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

DM is an ever-increasing epidemic affecting millions of elderly people worldwide, causing major repercussions on patients' daily lives, mostly due to chronic complications. Complications from DM can affect the brain, thereby characterizing DM as a risk factor for AD. In the present study, we examined the inhibitory activity of methanol extracts of different parts of 12 Angelica species against α-glucosidase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The methanol extract of Angelica decursiva exhibited the highest inhibitory activities against α-glucosidase, PTP1B, AChE, and BChE and so was selected for further investigation. Repeated column chromatography based on bioactivity-guided fractionation yielded seven compounds (1-7).

26150913,10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.01.30,Intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator and deoxyribonuclease therapy for pleural infection.,"Pleural infection remains a global health burden associated with significant morbidity. Drainage of the infected pleural fluid is important but can often be hindered by septations and loculations. Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy alone, to break pleural adhesions, has shown no convincing advantages over placebo in improving clinical outcome. Deoxyribonucleoprotein from degradation of leukocytes contributes significantly to high viscosity of infected pleural fluid. Recombinant deoxyribonuclease (DNase) is effective in reducing pleural fluid viscosity in pre-clinical studies. The combination of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and DNase was effective in animal model experiments of empyema. The benefits were established in a randomized clinical trial: those (n=48) treated with tPA/DNase had significantly improved radiological outcomes and reduced need of surgery and duration of hospital stay. A longitudinal observational series of 107 patients further confirmed the effectiveness and safety of tPA/DNase therapy, including its use as 'rescue therapy' when patients failed to respond to antibiotics and chest tube drainage. Overall, a short course of intrapleural tPA (10 mg) and DNase (5 mg) therapy provides a cure in over 90% of patients without requiring surgery. The treatment stimulates pleural fluid formation, enhances radiographic clearance and resolution of systemic inflammation. Serious complications are uncommon; pleural bleeding requiring transfusion occurred in ~2% of cases. Pain can occur, especially with the first dose. Treatment is contraindicated in those with significant bleeding diathesis or a bronchopleural fistula. Future research is required to optimize dosing regimens and in refining patient selection.",eng,Journal of thoracic disease,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This is especially true in the People's Republic of China, which has the largest population and an increasing proportion of elderly people, as osteoporosis has become a serious challenge to the Chinese government, society, and family. Apart from the fact that all osteoporotic fractures can increase the patient's morbidity, they can also result in fractures of the hip and vertebrae, which are associated with a significantly higher mortality. The cost of osteoporotic fractures, moreover, is a heavy burden on families, society, and even the country, which is likely to increase in the future due, in part, to the improvement in average life expectancy. Therefore, understanding the epidemiology of osteoporosis is essential and is significant for developing strategies to help reduce this problem. In this review, we will summarize the epidemiology of osteoporosis in the People's Republic of China, including the epidemiology of osteoporotic fractures, focusing on preventive methods and the management of osteoporosis, which consist of basic measures and pharmacological treatments.",eng,Clinical interventions in aging,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26150660,10.1098/rstb.2014.0294,The role of the local microbial ecosystem in respiratory health and disease.,"Respiratory tract infections are a major global health concern, accounting for high morbidity and mortality, especially in young children and elderly individuals. Traditionally, highly common bacterial respiratory tract infections, including otitis media and pneumonia, were thought to be caused by a limited number of pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. However, these pathogens are also frequently observed commensal residents of the upper respiratory tract (URT) and form-together with harmless commensal bacteria, viruses and fungi-intricate ecological networks, collectively known as the 'microbiome'. Analogous to the gut microbiome, the respiratory microbiome at equilibrium is thought to be beneficial to the host by priming the immune system and providing colonization resistance, while an imbalanced ecosystem might predispose to bacterial overgrowth and development of respiratory infections. We postulate that specific ecological perturbations of the bacterial communities in the URT can occur in response to various lifestyle or environmental effectors, leading to diminished colonization resistance, loss of containment of newly acquired or resident pathogens, preluding bacterial overgrowth, ultimately resulting in local or systemic bacterial infections. Here, we review the current body of literature regarding niche-specific upper respiratory microbiota profiles within human hosts and the changes occurring within these profiles that are associated with respiratory infections.",eng,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

In this review, we discuss the interplay between genetics, epigenetics, and environmental exposures in the pathogenesis of food allergies. We aim to highlight the most recent evidence that suggests how epigenetic control may mediate genetic susceptibility of food allergies. We also examine how epigenetic modifications may be the key in explaining how environmental factors modulate and modify gene expression, leading to the dysregulation of immune tolerance and consequently, the development of food allergies. The emerging epigenetic paradigm in food allergies is likely to provide new mechanistic insight into food allergy risk and development as well as shape our therapeutic and preventive strategies.",eng,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In April 2014, for the first time, the WHO produced guidelines for the screening, care and treatment of persons with hepatitis C infections. In May 2014, a follow-up resolution urged WHO Member States to develop and implement a national strategy for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis based on the local epidemiological context. Although blood donor screening, which began in the early 1990s, has reduced the spread of the virus in the population, the WHO estimates that 150 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and are at an increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, 3-4 million people are infected each year. HCV treatment is currently evolving rapidly, and several drugs are in various stages of development. With regard to the hepatitis B virus (HBV), in March 2015, the WHO published the first guidelines for the prevention, care and treatment of persons with chronic hepatitis B infection, which were designed to complement the recent guidelines on HCV. Although the introduction of an effective vaccine against the hepatitis B virus has reduced the prevalence and health and economic impact of hepatitis in industrialized countries, the WHO estimates that more than 2 billion people are HBV-infected and 350 million people are chronic carriers.",eng,Journal of infection and public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The mean (sd) package size of IPS drinks was significantly different for all countries (range: Australia=370 (149) ml to New Zealand=484 (191) ml; P<0·01). The mean (sd) package size of Dutch BPS drinks (1313 (323) ml) was significantly smaller compared with the other countries (New Zealand=1481 (595) ml, Australia=1542 (595) ml, Canada=1550 (434) ml; P<0·01). The mean (sd) serving size of BPS drinks was significantly different across all countries (range: Netherlands=216 (30) ml to Canada=248 (31) ml; P<0·00). New Zealand had the largest package and serving sizes of the countries assessed. In all countries, a large number of different serving sizes were used to provide information on the amount appropriate to consume in one sitting.--NEW SECTION--At this point there is substantial inconsistency in package sizes and manufacturer-recommended serving sizes of sweet beverages within and between four high-income countries, especially for IPS drinks. As consumers do factor serving size into their judgements of healthiness of a product, serving size regulations, preferably set by governments and global health organisations, would provide consistency and assist individuals in making healthier food choices.",eng,Public health nutrition,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26146999,10.1371/journal.pone.0131701,A Rapid and Low-Cost PCR Thermal Cycler for Low Resource Settings.,"Many modern molecular diagnostic assays targeting nucleic acids are typically confined to developed countries or to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. The ability to make technologies for the rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases broadly available in a portable, low-cost format would mark a revolutionary step forward in global health. Many molecular assays are also developed based on polymerase chain reactions (PCR), which require thermal cyclers that are relatively heavy (>20 pounds) and need continuous electrical power. The temperature ramping speed of most economical thermal cyclers are relatively slow (2 to 3 °C/s) so a polymerase chain reaction can take 1 to 2 hours. Most of all, these thermal cyclers are still too expensive ($2k to $4k) for low-resource setting uses.--NEW SECTION--In this article, we demonstrate the development of a low-cost and rapid water bath based thermal cycler that does not require active temperature control or continuous power supply during PCR. This unit costs $130 to build using commercial off-the-shelf items. The use of two or three vacuum-insulated stainless-steel Thermos food jars containing heated water (for denaturation and annealing/extension steps) and a layer of oil on top of the water allow for significantly stabilized temperatures for PCR to take place. Using an Arduino-based microcontroller, we automate the ""archaic"" method of hand-transferring PCR tubes between water baths.--NEW SECTION--We demonstrate that this innovative unit can deliver high speed PCR (17 s per PCR cycle) with the potential to go beyond the 1,522 bp long amplicons tested in this study and can amplify from templates down to at least 20 copies per reaction. The unit also accepts regular PCR tubes and glass capillary tubes. The PCR efficiency of our thermal cycler is not different from other commercial thermal cyclers. When combined with a rapid nucleic acid detection approach, the thermos thermal cycler (TTC) can enable on-site molecular diagnostics in low-resource settings.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

With its proposed strategy, the UN follows leading scientists who had declared the failure of former prevention strategies and now were promoting a 'Seek and Treat for Optimal Prevention' (STOP) approach as the most cost-effective response to the pandemic to meet the goal of 'an AIDS-free generation'. STOP combines antiretroviral therapy and routine HIV screening to find persons unaware that they are HIV-positive, because research has shown that people consistently change their behaviour (i.e. increase condom use, have fewer partners) after an HIV diagnosis. AIDS activists have broadly criticized this strategy on different levels. In this article, we go beyond these criticisms and try to analyse the political rationalities behind this 'new' strategy. We believe that it is necessary to put the rationale underpinning the STOP programme into the context of broader societal transformations that can best be captured as the development of advanced liberal societies and the new emphasis on self-controlling or self-responsibility rather than on disciplining behaviour.",eng,Nursing inquiry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Mainly due to change of diet and reduced physical activity, obesity is an important risk factor for chronic diseases. A higher level of cytokines and a general inflammatory state has also been associated with this condition. With this regard, potential anti-obesity compounds with anti-inflammatory properties could be beneficial in better control of the disease. p-Cymene is a natural aromatic compound that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, while the antidiabetic drug metformin has been observed to be effective as an aid for weight loss. In this study, the effect of these comounds was compared in a high fat diet treated mice model.--NEW SECTION--48 adult NMRI mice were randomly divided into six groups: control group receiving a normal diet, high fat diet (HFD) fed control group, sham group receiving HFD and sunflower seed oil, Experimental group1 (E1) receiving HFD and 20 mg/kg metformin, Experimental group2 (E2) receiving 20 mg/kg metformin and 20 mg/kg p-cymene, Experimental group3 (E3) receiving 20 mg/kg p-cymene. Compounds were administered by intragastric gavage for 45 days.--NEW SECTION--Non-fasting glucose serum levels, ALT, and ALP of E2 and E3 decreased significantly compared to HFD control group. In the E3 group, AST levels decrease was also significant. In E1, non-fasting glucose and TG serum levels decreased significantly compared to HFD control group. Histological observations on liver tissue showed an increase of lipid droplets in the HFD control group compared with the normal group, while upon treatment with the compounds, lipid droplets decreased and the cells appeared to be more ordered.--NEW SECTION--p-Cymene has a potential to ameliorate biochemical parameters in high fat diet treated mice, and its concurrent use with metformin was effective.",eng,Journal of diabetes and metabolic disorders,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This study evaluates the change of HIV/AIDS mortality rates in Asian and North African countries from 1990 to 2010 using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. HIV/AIDS mortality rates were derived from the GBD database from 1990 to 2010, for 52 countries in Asia and North Africa. First, a Latent Growth Model was employed to assess the change in AIDS mortality rate over time in six different regions of Asia, and also the change in AIDS mortality rate over time for males and females in Asia and North Africa. Finally, Latent Growth Mixture Models (LGMMs) were applied to identify distinct groups in which countries within each group have similar trends over time. Our results showed that increase in mortality rate over time for males is about three times greater than for females. The highest and lowest trend of AIDS mortality rates were observed in South-East Asia and high-income Asia-Pacific regions, respectively. The LGMM allocated most countries in the South and South-East region into two classes with the highest trend of AIDS mortality rates. Although the HIV/AIDS mortality rates are decreasing in some countries and clusters, the general trend in the Asian continent is upwards. Therefore, it is necessary to provide programmes to achieve the goal of access to HIV prevention measures, treatment, care, and support for high-risk groups, especially in countries with a higher trend of AIDS mortality rates.",eng,Epidemiology and infection,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Stakeholder meetings allowed partnership leaders to review results, set priorities, and allocate resources. Investments included salary support, infrastructure improvements, medical equipment, and social support for patients. We compared facility domain scores from the start of the intervention to 12 months and tested for correlation between change in score and change in funding allocation to assess equity in our approach.--NEW SECTION--We found significant improvements among intervention facilities from baseline to 12 months across several domains [infrastructure (+4, p=0.0001), clinical services (+1.2, p=0.03), infection and sanitation control (+0.6, p=0.03), medical equipment (+1.0, p=0.02), information use (+2, p=0.002)]. Composite score across domains improved from 6.2 at baseline to 7.4 at 12 months (p=0.002). Across facilities, 50% had composite scores greater than the average score among reference facilities (7.4) at 12 months compared to none at baseline.--NEW SECTION--Rapid facility surveys, stakeholder engagement, and information feedback can be used for gap analysis and resource allocation. This approach can achieve effective use of limited resources, improve facility readiness, and ensure consistency of facility capacity to provide quality care at the district level.",eng,Global health action,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This is an observational study conducted in 363 patients aged≥65years, newly diagnosed with different hematological malignancies (myelodysplasic syndrome/acute myeloblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia), and treatment-naïve. The scale psychometric validation process included the analyses of feasibility, floor and ceiling effect, validity and reliability criteria.--NEW SECTION--Mean time taken to complete the GAH scale was 11.9±4.7min that improved through a learning-curve effect. Almost 90% of patients completed all items, and no floor or ceiling effects were identified. Criterion validity was supported by reasonable correlations between the GAH scale dimensions and three contrast variables (global health visual analogue scale, ECOG and Karnofsky), except for comorbidities. Factor analysis (supported by the scree plot) revealed nine factors that explained almost 60% of the total variance. Moderate internal consistency reliability was found (Cronbach's α: 0.610), and test-retest was excellent (ICC coefficients, 0.695-0.928).--NEW SECTION--Our study suggests that the GAH scale is a valid, internally reliable and a consistent tool to assess health status in older patients with different hematological malignancies. Future large studies should confirm whether the GAH scale may be a tool to improve clinical decision-making in older patients with hematological malignancies.",eng,Journal of geriatric oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26139288,10.1038/srep11820,Comparative assessment of vaccine vectors encoding ten malaria antigens identifies two protective liver-stage candidates.,"The development of an efficacious Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine remains a top priority for global health. Vaccination with irradiated sporozoites is able to provide complete sterile protection through the action of CD8(+) T cells at the liver-stage of infection. However, this method is currently unsuitable for large-scale deployment and focus has instead turned to the development of sub-unit vaccines. Sub-unit vaccine efforts have traditionally focused on two well-known pre-erythrocytic antigens, CSP and TRAP, yet thousands of genes are expressed in the liver-stage. We sought to assess the ability of eight alternative P. falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens to induce a high proportion of CD8(+) T cells. We show that all antigens, when expressed individually in the non-replicating viral vectors ChAd63 and MVA, are capable of inducing an immune response in mice. Furthermore, we also developed chimeric P. berghei parasites expressing the cognate P. falciparum antigen to enable assessment of efficacy in mice. Our preliminary results indicate that vectors encoding either PfLSA1 or PfLSAP2 are capable of inducing sterile protection dependent on the presence of CD8(+) T cells. This work has identified two promising P. falciparum liver-stage candidate antigens that will now undergo further testing in humans.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Cases with ACS were identified using Swedish national health registers and matched with up to 5 controls without ACS, based on incidence density-based sampling. Information on potential exposures (clinical disease activity, serologic features, genetic markers, comorbidities, pharmacotherapies, and sick leave) was collected from medical charts and register-based sources.--NEW SECTION--We identified 138 cases and 624 controls. Smoking, history of myocardial infarction, and >50 days of sick leave the year following RA onset were associated with an increased risk of ACS. Area under the curve measurements of C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), and global health in the upper tertile during the first year and the complete followup period were both strongly associated with an increased risk of ACS. Treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs did not alter the ACS risk, nor did the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) or shared epitope alleles, whereas high anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) levels were borderline significantly associated with ACS risk.--NEW SECTION--In this study of risk factors for ACS in incident RA, clinical markers of inflammatory activity, disease activity, and total number of days of sick leave and disability pension during the first year following RA onset were identified as ACS risk factors. We found no association with RF, which was previously linked to cardiovascular disease risk in RA, but there was a borderline significant association with high ACPA levels.",eng,"Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26135987,10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2015-052250,Investment incentives and the implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control: evidence from Zambia.,"Policy misalignment across different sectors of government serves as one of the pivotal barriers to WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) implementation. This paper examines the logic used by government officials to justify investment incentives to increase tobacco processing and manufacturing in the context of FCTC implementation in Zambia.--NEW SECTION--We conducted qualitative semistructured interviews with key informants from government, civil society and intergovernmental economic organisations (n=23). We supplemented the interview data with an analysis of public documents pertaining to the policy of economic development in Zambia.--NEW SECTION--We found gross misalignments between the policies of the economic sector and efforts to implement the provisions of the FCTC. Our interviews uncovered the rationale used by officials in the economic sector to justify providing economic incentives to bolster tobacco processing and manufacturing in Zambia: (1) tobacco is not consumed by Zambians/tobacco is an export commodity, (2) economic benefits outweigh health costs and (3) tobacco consumption is a personal choice.--NEW SECTION--Much of the struggle Zambia has experienced in implementing the FCTC can be attributed to misalignments between the economic and health sectors. Zambia's development agenda seeks to bolster agricultural processing and manufacturing. Tobacco control proponents must recognise and work within this context in order to foster productive strategies with those working on tobacco supply issues. These findings are broadly applicable to the global context. It is important that the Ministry of Health monitors the tobacco policy of and engages with these sectors to find ways of harmonising FCTC implementation.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26135634,10.1016/j.arcmed.2015.06.006,Global Overview of the Epidemiology of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease.,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the global burden of ACD and its risk factors and to discuss the main challenges and opportunities for prevention. Publicly available data from the Global Burden of Disease Study were analyzed for ischemic heart disease (IHD), ischemic stroke and ACD risk factors. Data from the WHO Global Health Observatory were used to describe prevalence of diverse cardiometabolic risk factors. World Bank Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPc) information was used to categorize countries according to income level. Cardiovascular mortality decreased globally from 1990-2010 with important differences by GDPc; during 1990 there was a positive association between IHD mortality and GDPc. Higher-income countries had higher rates compared to those of lower-income countries. High levels of body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol have a differential contribution to mortality by income group over time; high-income countries have been able to reduce the contribution from these risk factors in the last 20 years, whereas lower/middle income countries show an increasing trend in mortality attributable to high BMI and glucose. Although age-adjusted ACD mortality rate trends decreased globally, the absolute number of ACD deaths is increasing in part due to the growth of the population and aging, as well as to important lifestyle and food-system changes that likely attenuate gains in prevention. Population and individual level preventable causes of ACD must be aggressively and efficiently targeted in countries of lower economic development in order to reduce the growing burden of disease due to ACD.",eng,Archives of medical research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Service provision in a community is often disjointed among a variety of providers. We sought to reduce unmet patient needs by increasing referral coordination for HIV and family planning, measured as network density, with an organizational network approach.--NEW SECTION--We conducted organizational network analysis on two networks in sub-cities of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. There were 25 organizations in one sub-city network and 26 in the other. In one of them we sought to increase referrals through three network strengthening meetings. We then conducted the network analysis again in both sub-cities to measure any changes since baseline. We also quantitatively measured reported client service needs in both sub-cities before and after the intervention with two cross-sectional samples of face-to-face interviews with clients (459 at baseline and 587 at follow-up).--NEW SECTION--In the sub-city with the intervention, the number of referral connections between organizations, measured as network density, increased 55%. In the control community, the density decreased over the same period. Reported unmet client service needs declined more consistently across services in the intervention community.--NEW SECTION--This quasi experiment demonstrated that (1) an organizational network analysis can inform an intervention, (2) a modest network strengthening intervention can enhance client referrals in the network, (3) improvement in client referrals was accompanied by a decrease in atient-reported unmet needs and (4) a series of network analyses can be a useful evaluation tool.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Essential for viability and virulence, enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of mycolic acids represent novel targets for drug development. This is particularly relevant to the impact on global health given the rise of multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how mycolic acid are synthesised, especially the potential role of specialised fatty acid synthase complexes. Also, we examine the role of a recently reported mycolic acid transporter MmpL3 with reference to several reports of the targeting of this transporter by diverse compounds with anti-M. tuberculosis activity. Additionally, we consider recent findings that place mycolic acid biosynthesis in the context of the cell biology of the bacterium, viz its localisation and co-ordination with the bacterial cytoskeleton, and its role beyond maintaining cell envelope integrity.",eng,Molecular microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

An effective and reliable method for testing the virulence of different microbial pathogens is therefore a useful research tool. This protocol describes how the chicken embryo can be used as a trustworthy, inexpensive, ethically desirable and quickly accessible model to assess the virulence of the human bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, which can also be extended to other microbial pathogens. We provide a step-by-step protocol and figures and videos detailing the method, including egg handling, infection strategies, pathogenicity screening and isolation of infected organs. From the start of incubation of the fertilized eggs, the protocol takes <4 weeks to complete, with the infection part taking only 3 d.

However, its molecular pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Combined proteomics and metabolomics approaches should provide a comprehensive understanding of MDD's etiology. The present study reports novel ""-omics"" insights from a rodent model of MDD. Cerebellar samples from chronic mild stressed (CMS)-treated depressed rats and controls were compared with a focus on the differentially expressed proteins and metabolites using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics and gas chromotography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics techniques, respectively. The combined analyses found significant alterations associated with cerebellar energy metabolism, as indicated by (1) abnormal amino acid metabolism accompanied by corresponding metabolic enzymatic alterations and disturbed protein turnover, (2) increased glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme levels paralleled by changes in the concentrations of associated metabolites, and (3) perturbation of ATP biosynthesis through adenosine accompanied by perturbation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to integrate proteomics and metabolomics analyses to examine the pathophysiological mechanism(s) underlying MDD in a CMS rodent model of depression.

Accomplishment of these goals would be markedly enhanced by the enhanced destruction of the adult stage of filariae. The identification of new, more quantitative biomarkers that correlate with mortality or chemotherapeutic damage to adult filariae, would greatly facilitate, for example, the development of new macrofilaricides.--NEW SECTION--An immunocytochemical approach using an antibody against human Nras was used to identify and detect changes in the nematode homolog let-60 that is associated with cell growth and maintenance. Single Onchocerca volvulus nodules were removed from each of 13 patients treated with ivermectin (as part of a community-wide mass drug administration programme), and from each of 13 untreated individuals; these 26 nodules were stained with the anti-Nras antibody. The localization and degree of positivity of Nras/let-60 staining were assessed subjectively and compared between the two groups; the positivity of staining was also quantified, using image analysis, in a subgroup of these nodules. In addition, the specific morphological association between Nras/let-60 and the Wolbachia endosymbiont present in these parasites was also observed in 4 additional filarial species using an anti-Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) antibody under light and confocal microscopy.--NEW SECTION--Nras/let-60 is present in many structures within the adult female worms. A statistically significant decrease in the general staining intensity of Nras/let-60 was observed in adult female O. volvulus treated with ivermectin when compared with parasites from untreated patients. Nras/let-60 staining was frequently observed to be co-localized with WSP in O.volvulus, Brugia malayi, Litomosoides sigmodontis and Dirofilaria immitis. Nras/let60 is also present in Onchocerca ochengi.--NEW SECTION--Nras/let-60, as detected by immunocytochemical staining, is decreased in ivermectin-treated adult female O. volvulus relative to untreated control specimens, suggesting a suppressive effect of ivermectin on the overall biochemical activity of these parasites. Co-localization of Nras/let-60 and WSP suggests the possibility that the endosymbiont utilizes this nematode protein as part of a mutualistic relationship. Nras/let60 appears to be a useful biomarker for assessing the health of filariae.",eng,Parasites & vectors,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, guidelines and scholarship regarding community engagement are arguably unsettled, making it difficult to implement and evaluate.--NEW SECTION--We describe normative guidelines on community engagement that have been offered by national and international bodies in the context of HIV-related research, which set the stage for similar work in other health related research. Next, we review the scholarly literature regarding community engagement, outlining the diverse ethical goals ascribed to it. We then discuss practical guidelines that have been issued regarding community engagement. There is a lack of consensus regarding the ethical goals and approaches for community engagement, and an associated lack of indicators and metrics for evaluating success in achieving stated goals. To address these gaps we outline a framework for developing indicators for evaluating the contribution of community engagement to ethical goals in health research. There is a critical need to enhance efforts in evaluating community engagement to ensure that the work on the ground reflects the intentions expressed in the guidelines, and to investigate the contribution of specific community engagement practices for making research responsive to community needs and concerns. Evaluation mechanisms should be built into community engagement practices to guide best practices in community engagement and their replication across diverse health research settings.",eng,BMC medical ethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Every year, 8 million children die before they reach the age of 5 from preventable diseases. ""Exotic illnesses"" cease to be so exotic, they can cross borders easily. Ebola, originally an African worry, in 2014 was an international threat. The revolution in information technologies enables us witness the emergence of transnational epistemic communities exhibiting, measuring and explaining health and disease. Presently, the authors are more aware than ever of the health problems of people from far away countries, which decades ago were unknown and distant. The transparency and availability of this information exhibits, in a quasi-obscene way, an unacceptable world. A world that is willing to rescue banks and ignores the worst off - those people whose unlucky birth seals a never ending cycle of misery with almost no possibility of breaking it. This paper address the situation just described by asking: Are these new empiric circumstances reflected in the authors' moral understanding of the issues? How should the world think of global health and their obligations towards people living in deprivation? How can the new empiric possibilities the global world offers be related to the implementation of such obligations? What are some of the challenges to the translation of new obligations to the present world? In addressing these questions, the paper argues that if the world seriously wants to address the obligations towards those in need, even if they are far away from the places they may need to work not only with ideal proposals such as the ""new obligations"" pointed by Singer and Pogge, but also with different transitional theories and non-ideal strategies in order to solve some of the big challenges the real world impose to theories.",eng,International journal of technoethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Soy genistein is a legume that has numerous health benefits. This work aimed to study the effect of different doses of genistein on histological, immunohistochemical and morphometrical changes in β-cells of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and to correlate these effects with plasma glucose and insulin levels. Fifty adult male rats were divided into five equal groups. Group I served as a control. Group II received genistein. Group III comprised STZ-induced diabetic rats. Group IV diabetic animals treated with low dosage genistein. Group V diabetic animals treated with high dosage genistein. Genistein was given for 4 weeks after STZ injection. Rats were sacrificed and pancreatic specimens were taken for light and electron microscopic examination. Blood samples were collected for detection of serum glucose and insulin levels. After diabetic induction, the islets appeared shrunken with cytoplasmic vacuolation of their cells and negative insulin immunoreaction. Ultrastructurally, β-cells showed darkly stained nuclei with marked loss of granules. Morphometrically, significant loss of β-cells was detected. The serum insulin level was decreased with elevation in the serum glucose. High-dose but not low-dose genistein improved the morphology of islets with increased insulin immunoreaction. Genistein also significantly decreased β-cells loss and improved glucose and insulin levels. In conclusion, genistein has a protective effect on pancreatic β-cells damage, possesses the ability to regenerate β-cells and improves serum levels of insulin and glucose in STZ-induced diabetic rats in a dosage-dependent manner.",eng,Journal of microscopy and ultrastructure,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We retrospectively sought predictors of long-term outcome in a cohort of 83 patients who had undergone LVAD treatment. We subjected perioperative clinical data of patients to statistical analysis to establish parameters associated with all-cause mortality, and the cutoff values, sensitivity, and specificity of those that had a statistically significant relation with survival. Mean follow-up was 717 days (standard deviation, 334 days; range, 17-1,592 days). Fourteen patients (16.8%) died, but nine (10.8%) were weaned from support. Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration measured 60 days after implantation was significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The optimal BNP cutoff value to predict death during LVAD support was 322 pg/ml, with a sensitivity of 71.4% and specificity of 79.8%. Two-year survival was 92.0% in those with 60 days serum BNP concentration <322 pg/ml compared with 70.5% in those in whom it was ≥322 pg/ml (p = 0.003). The relation between BNP and survival likely reflects recovery of native myocardial function and improvements in global health and should assist clinicians in the on-going management of long-term LVAD therapy.",eng,ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26120784,10.1021/acs.est.5b01129,Ionic Liquid Facilitates the Conjugative Transfer of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Mediated by Plasmid RP4.,"The dissemination and propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is an emerging global health concern. In our previous study, the ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIm][PF6]) had been proven to facilitate the dissemination of ARGs via horizontal gene transfer. In this study, we further confirm that this compound facilitates the horizontal transfer of plasmid RP4 through a conjugation mechanism and not by natural transformation. The mechanisms for [BMIm][PF6] promoting conjugative transfer are attributable to enhancing the mRNA expression levels of conjugative and global regulatory genes, as well as by inhibiting the genes that are responsible for the vertical transfer of cell growth. [BMIm][PF6] significantly enhanced the expression of the outer membrane porin proteins (OMPs) OmpC and OmpA and the corresponding mRNA expression levels of ompC and ompA genes in recipient bacteria, which contributed to pore formation and increased cell membrane permeability. The increased expression of pilin and pili allowed the donor pilus to attach to and access the recipient cells, thereby assisting cell-to-cell contact to facilitate the conjugative transfer of plasmid RP4. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first insightful exploration of [BMIm][PF6] facilitating the conjugative transfer of ARGs mediated by plasmid RP4 and of several other ILs with different cations or anions that are capable of promoting plasmid transfer. It is therefore suggested that the application of some ILs in industrial processes should be carefully evaluated before their bulk emission into the environment.",eng,Environmental science & technology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Noncommunicable disease policies and the global political economy of risk.,"The growing prevalence of NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is now recognized as one of the major global health policy issues of the early 21st century. Current official approaches reflect ambivalence about how health policy should approach the social determinants of health identified by the WHO Commission on the topic that released its report in 2008, and in particular the role of macro-scale economic and social processes. Authoritative framing of options for NCD prevention in advance of the September, 2011 UN high-level meeting on NCDs arguably relied on a selective reading of the scientific (including social scientific) evidence, and foregrounded a limited number of risk factors defined in terms of individual behavior: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, alcohol (ab)use and physical inactivity. The effect was to reproduce at a transnational level the individualization of responsibility for health that characterizes most health promotion initiatives in high-income countries, ignoring both the limited control that many people have over their exposure to these risk factors and the contribution of macro-scale processes like trade liberalization and the marketing activities of transnational corporations to the global burden of NCDs. An alternative perspective focuses on ""the inequitable distribution of power, money, and resources"" described by the WHO Commission, and the ways in which policies that address those inequities can avoid unintentional incorporation of neoliberal constructions of risk and responsibility.",eng,Health & place,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Interventions delivered by mobile phone have been demonstrated to be effective in other health areas, but their effects on use of contraception have not been established.--NEW SECTION--To assess the effects of mobile phone-based interventions for improving contraception use.--NEW SECTION--We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of client-provider interventions delivered by mobile phone to improve contraception use compared with standard care or another intervention. We searched the electronic databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, PsycINFO, POPLINE, Africa-Wide Information and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) from January 1993 to October 2014, as well as clinical trials registries, online mHealth resources and abstracts from key conferences.--NEW SECTION--Randomised controlled trials of mobile phone-based interventions to improve any form of contraception use amongst users or potential users of contraception. Outcome measures included uptake of contraception, measures of adherence, pregnancy and abortion.--NEW SECTION--Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of studies retrieved using the search strategy and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Differences in interventions and outcome measures did not permit us to undertake meta-analysis.--NEW SECTION--Five RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Three trials aimed to improve adherence to a specific method of contraception amongst existing or new contraception users by comparing automated text message interventions versus standard care. Two trials aimed to improve both uptake and adherence, not limited to one method, in both users and non-users of contraception. No trials were at low risk of bias in all areas assessed.One trial in the USA reported improved self reported oral contraceptive (OC) continuation at six months from an intervention comprising a range of uni-directional and interactive text messages (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.35). One trial in Cambodia reported increased self reported use of effective contraception at four months post abortion from an intervention comprising automated interactive voice messages and phone counsellor support (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.66).One feasibility trial in the USA reported a lower mean number of days between scheduled and completed attendance for the first but not subsequent Depo-Provera appointments using clinic records from an intervention comprising reminders and healthy self management text messages (mean difference (MD) -8.60 days, 95% CI -16.74 to -0.46). Simple text message OC reminders had no effect on missed pills as assessed by electronic medication monitoring in a small trial in the USA (MD 0.5 missed pills, 95% CI -1.08 to 2.08). No effect on self reported contraception use was noted amongst isotretinoin users from an intervention that provided health information via two uni-directional text messages and mail (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.89). One trial assessed potential adverse effects of the intervention and reported no evidence of road traffic accidents or domestic abuse.--NEW SECTION--Our review provides limited evidence that interventions delivered by mobile phone can improve contraception use. Whilst evidence suggests that a series of interactive voice messages and counsellor support can improve post-abortion contraception, and that a mixture of uni-directional and interactive daily educational text messages can improve OC adherence, the cost-effectiveness and long-term effects of these interventions remain unknown. Further high-quality trials are required to robustly establish the effects of interventions delivered by mobile phone to improve contraception use.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

African responses have been varied and largely ineffective. The WHO and the international community's belated responses have yet to quell the epidemic. The crisis is characteristic of a failure to properly comply with the International Health Regulations 2005. More generally, it stems from a failure of international health justice as articulated by a range of legal institutions and instruments, and it should prompt us to question the state and direction of approaches to the governance of global public health. This paper queries what might be done to lift global public health as a policy arena to the place of prominence that it deserves. It argues that there are at least two critical reasons for the past, present and easily anticipated future failings of the global public health regime. After exploring those, it then articulates a new way forward, identifying three courses of action that might be adopted in realising better health outcomes and global health justice, namely value, institutional and legal reform.",eng,Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We begin by briefly summarizing the report of the Lancet - University of Oslo Commission on Global Governance for Health: 'The Political Origins of Health Inequity' Ottersen et al. In order to provide compelling evidence of the central argument, the Commission selected seven case studies relating to, inter alia, economic and fiscal policy, food security, and foreign trade and investment agreements. Based on an analysis of these studies, the report concludes that the problems identified are often due to political choices: an unwillingness to change the global system of governance. This raises the question: what is the most effective way that a report of this kind can be used to motivate policy-makers, and the public at large, to demand change? What kind of moral or rational argument is most likely to lead to action? In this paper we assess the merits of various alternative perspectives: health as an investment; health as a global public good; health and human security; health and human development; health as a human right; health and global justice. We conclude that what is required in order to motivate change is a more explicitly political and moral perspective - favouring the later rather than the earlier alternatives just listed.",eng,Public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Research has shown that adults with ID have higher body mass index (BMI) than adults without ID, but this information is primarily based on populations residing in North American and European countries. The purpose of this study was to compare BMI and obesity status of Chinese and U.S. Special Olympic athletes with ID.--NEW SECTION--Height, weight, BMI and self-reported physical activity (SRPA) data from the Special Olympics 2006 U.S. National Games and 2007 Shanghai World Games databases were analyzed. Linear and logistic analyses were conducted for continuous data and dichotomous variables, respectively. Predictor variables were age, gender, country, SRPA, and obesity status according to country specific criteria. Significance was set at p < 0.05.--NEW SECTION--The U.S. group had significantly higher BMI values than their Chinese counterparts. Age (p = 0.001) and country (p = <0.001) were the main predictors of BMI and obesity status, even when country-specific standards of obesity classifications were used. Holding all other factors constant, each unit increase of age was associated with increased odds for obesity by a factor of 1.04 and the odds of obesity occurring in U.S. athletes was 2.47 times greater than in Chinese athletes.--NEW SECTION--Obesity is an emerging health problem for Chinese adults with ID.

For undergraduates, the majority of exposure to 'hands-on' teaching on global health occurs during optional elective periods. This article describes an innovative student-led initiative, 'Disaster Day', which used simulation to teach global health to undergraduates.--NEW SECTION--The teaching day began with an introduction outlining the work of Médecins Sans Frontières and the basic principles of resuscitation. Students then undertook four interactive simulation scenarios: Infectious Diseases in a Refugee Camp, Natural Disaster and Crush Injury, Obstetric Emergency in a Low-Income Country, and Warzone Gunshot Wound. Sessions were facilitated by experienced doctors and fourth-year students who had been trained in the delivery of the scenarios. Students completed pre- and post-session evaluation forms that included the self-rating of confidence in eight learning domains (using a five-point Likert scale).--NEW SECTION--Twenty-seven students voluntarily attended the session, and all provided written feedback. Analysis of the pre- and post-session evaluations demonstrated statistically significant improvements in confidence across all but one domains (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Free-text feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with students appreciating the practical aspect of the scenarios. For undergraduates, the majority of exposure to 'hands-on' teaching on global health occurs during optional elective periods--NEW SECTION--Simulation-based teaching can provide students with 'hands-on' exposure to global health in a controlled, reproducible fashion and appears to help develop their confidence in a variety of learning domains.

Although current therapies, such as the use of nucleos(t)ide analogs, inhibit HBV replication efficiently, they do not eliminate covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which persists in hepatocyte nuclei. As HBV cccDNA is a viral transcription template, novel therapeutic approaches to directly target HBV cccDNA are necessary to completely eradicate persistent HBV infections. HBV cccDNA levels in HBV-infected human liver cells are extremely low; thus, more reliable and simple measurement methods are needed to correctly monitor their levels during therapeutic treatment. Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or Southern blot procedures are currently used in research studies, these methods are not completely reliable and are also time-consuming and labor-intensive. Genome editing technologies, such as zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system, which are designed to target specific DNA sequences, represent highly promising potential therapeutic tools. In particular, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is an easily customizable sequence-specific nuclease with high flexibility and may be the most feasible approach to target HBV cccDNA.

New therapeutic agents with excellent sustained virological response (SVR) rates are available mainly in developed countries, while the majority of CHC patients live in countries with low health budget. Predictors of therapeutic response are therefore necessary. Vitamin B12 appears to be involved in hepatitis C virus replication.--NEW SECTION--We therefore studied retrospectively the relationship between baseline serum vitamin B12 levels and clinical features in 116 CHC genotype 1 infected patients. Logistic regression models with univariate and multivariate analysis were used in the statistical analysis.--NEW SECTION--Baseline serum vitamin B12 levels were found to be positively associated with serum transaminase activities (AST, p = 0.002, ALT, p = 0.04), baseline viral load (p < 0.0001), stage of fibrosis (p = 0.0001) and favorable interferon-λ3/4 (IFNL3/IFNL4) rs12979860 genotypes (p = 0.04), and inversely with SVR (p < 0.001) as well as with rapid virological response (p = 0.001).

To improve the consistency of health facilities assessments, the World Health Organization has proposed the use of the Health Resources Availability Mapping System (HeRAMS) developed in Darfur, Sudan as a standardized assessment tool for use in future acute and protracted crises. This study provides an evaluation of HeRAMS' comprehensiveness, and investigates the methods, quality and comprehensiveness of health facilities data and tools in Haiti, where HeRAMS was not used.--NEW SECTION--Tools and databases containing health facilities data in Haiti were collected using a snowball sampling technique, while HeRAMS was purposefully evaluated in Sudan. All collected tools were assessed for quality and comprehensiveness using a coding scheme based on the World Health Organization's health systems building blocks, the Global Health Cluster Suggested Set of Core Indicators and Benchmarks by Category, and the Sphere Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Humanitarian Response. Eight assessments and databases were located in Haiti, and covered a median of 3.5 of the 6 health system building blocks, 4.5 of the 14 Sphere standards, and 2 of the 9 Health Cluster indicators. None of the assessments covered all of the indicators in any of the assessment criteria and many lacked basic data, limiting the detail of analysis possible for calculating standardized benchmarks and indicators. In Sudan, HeRAMS collected data on 5 of the 6 health system building blocks, 13 of the 14 Sphere Standards, and collected data to allow the calculation of 7 of the 9 Health Cluster Core Indicators and Benchmarks.--NEW SECTION--There is a need to agree upon essential health facilities data in disrupted health systems during humanitarian emergencies. Although the quality of the assessments in Haiti was generally poor, the large number of platforms and assessment tools deployed suggests that health facilities data can be collected even during acute emergencies. Further consensus is needed to establish essential criteria for data collection and to establish a core group of health systems assessment experts to be deployed during future emergencies.",eng,Conflict and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Antimicrobial drug resistance is now considered a global health security challenge of the 21st century, and this heterogeneous group of microorganisms represents a significant part of this public health issue.The presence of the same resistant genes in unrelated bacterial genera indicates a complex history of genetic interactions. Plasmids have largely contributed to the spread of resistance genes among Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus species, also influencing the selection and ecological variation of specific populations. However, this information is fragmented and often omits species outside these genera. To date, the antimicrobial resistance problem has been analyzed under a ""single centric"" perspective (""gene tracking"" or ""vehicle centric"" in ""single host-single pathogen"" systems) that has greatly delayed the understanding of gene and plasmid dynamics and their role in the evolution of bacterial communities.This work analyzes the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance genes using gene exchange networks; the role of plasmids in the emergence, dissemination, and maintenance of genes encoding resistance to antimicrobials (antibiotics, heavy metals, and biocides); and their influence on the genomic diversity of the main Gram-positive opportunistic pathogens under the light of evolutionary ecology.

Several systematic reviews have shown that technology is successful in combating obesity through increased physical activity, but there is no known review on interventions that use an electronic activity monitor system (EAMS). EAMSs are defined as a wearable device that objectively measures lifestyle physical activity and can provide feedback, beyond the display of basic activity count information, via the monitor display or through a partnering application to elicit continual self-monitoring of activity behavior. These devices improve upon standard pedometers because they have the ability to provide visual feedback on activity progression, verbal encouragement, and social comparison. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the efficacy and feasibility results of EAMSs within published physical activity interventions.--NEW SECTION--Electronic databases and journal references were searched for relevant articles. Data sources included CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline Ovid, PsycINFO, and clinicaltrials.gov. Out of the 1,574 retrieved, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria. These articles were reviewed for quality and content based on a risk of bias tool and intervention components.--NEW SECTION--Most articles were determined to be of medium quality while two were of low quality, and one of high quality. Significant pre-post improvements in the EAMS group were found in five of nine studies for physical activity and in four of five studies for weight. One found a significant increase in physical activity and two studies found significant weight loss in the intervention group compared with the comparator group. The EAMS interventions appear to be feasible with most studies reporting continual wear of the device during waking hours and a higher retention rate of participants in the EAMS groups.--NEW SECTION--These studies provide preliminary evidence suggesting that EAMS can increase physical activity and decrease weight significantly, but their efficacy compared to other interventions has not yet been demonstrated. More high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the overall effect of EAMS, examine which EAMS features are most effective, and determine which populations are most receptive to an EAMS.",eng,BMC public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB, demands new measures to combat the situation. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of the pathogen and its drug susceptibility pattern is essential for timely initiation of optimal treatment, and, ultimately, control of the disease. We have developed a molecular method for detection of first- and second-line drug resistance in M. tuberculosis by Pyrosequencing(®). The method consists of seven Pyrosequencing assays for the detection of mutations in the genes or promoter regions, which are most commonly responsible for resistance to the drugs rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, and fluoroquinolones. The method was validated on clinical isolates and it was shown that the sensitivity and specificity of the method were comparable to those of Sanger sequencing. In the protocol in this chapter we describe the steps necessary for setting up and performing Pyrosequencing for M. tuberculosis. The first part of the protocol describes the assay development and the second part of the protocol describes utilization of the method.",eng,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Despite remaining one of the poorest countries in the world, Rwanda has made remarkable gains in health, social, and economic development over the last 20 years, but modern emergency care has been slow to progress. Rwanda has recently established the Human Resources for Health program to rapidly build capacity in multiple sectors of its healthcare delivery system, including emergency medicine. This project involves multiple medical and surgical residencies, nursing programs, allied health professional trainings, and hospital administrative support. A real strength of the program is that trainers work with international faculty at Rwanda's referral hospital, but also as emergency medicine specialty trainers when returning to their respective district hospitals. Rwanda's first emergency medicine trainees are playing a unique and important role in the implementation of emergency care systems and education in the country's district hospitals. While there has been early vital progress in building emergency medicine's foundations in Rwanda, there remains much work to be done.

Approximately 2 billion people worldwide have been infected, and approximately 350 million individuals currently suffer from HBV-induced chronic liver infection, which causes 600,000 deaths annually from chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV is classified in eight genotypes (A-H), and two more have been proposed (I-J). In this paper, complete genome sequences of nine Uruguayan HBV are reported. Five samples belong to genotype F1b and one to genotype A2. Three HBV recombinants were detected: A1/F1b, A2/F1b and D3/F1b. The following mutations were detected: a G1896A substitution, a 33-nucleotide deletion from position 2896 to 2928 in the Pre-S1 region involving Pre-S1 residues 3-13, a 33-nt deletion in the Pre-S1 region involving nt 2913-2945 and Pre-S1 residues 9-19. More F genotypes strains than expected were detected in this study, supporting the hypothesis that there are more people of indigenous origin than declared in our population. Also, one third of the samples analyzed were recombinants.

In the present study, we used resting state functional MRI to investigate the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations of spontaneous signal during both hunger and satiety states in 20 lean and 20 obese males. We found that, before food intake, obese men had significantly greater baseline activity in the precuneus and lesser activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) relative to lean subjects. Furthermore, after food intake, obese males had significantly lesser activity in dACC than lean males. We further found a significant positive correlation between precuneus activation and hunger ratings before food intake, while dACC activity was negatively correlated with plasma insulin levels before and after food intake. These results indicated that both precuneus and dACC may play an important role in eating behavior. While precuneus rather seemed to mediate subjective satiety, dACC levels rather reflected indirect measures of glucose utilization.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26098111,10.1371/journal.pone.0129850,Metabolic Syndrome Is Associated with Increased Oxo-Nitrative Stress and Asthma-Like Changes in Lungs.,"Epidemiological studies have shown an increased obesity-related risk of asthma. In support, obese mice develop airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). However, it remains unclear whether the increased risk is a consequence of obesity, adipogenic diet, or the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Altered L-arginine and nitric oxide (NO) metabolism is a common feature between asthma and metabolic syndrome that appears independent of body mass. Increased asthma risk resulting from such metabolic changes would have important consequences in global health. Since high-sugar diets can induce MetS, without necessarily causing obesity, studies of their effect on arginine/NO metabolism and airway function could clarify this aspect. We investigated whether normal-weight mice with MetS, due to high-fructose diet, had dysfunctional arginine/NO metabolism and features of asthma. Mice were fed chow-diet, high-fat-diet, or high-fructose-diet for 18 weeks. Only the high-fat-diet group developed obesity or adiposity. Hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycaemia, and hyperlipidaemia were common to both high-fat-diet and high-fructose-diet groups and the high-fructose-diet group additionally developed hypertension. At 18 weeks, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) could be seen in obese high-fat-diet mice as well as non-obese high-fructose-diet mice, when compared to standard chow-diet mice. No inflammatory cell infiltrate or goblet cell metaplasia was seen in either high-fat-diet or high-fructose-diet mice. Exhaled NO was reduced in both these groups. This reduction in exhaled NO correlated with reduced arginine bioavailability in lungs. In summary, mice with normal weight but metabolic obesity show reduced arginine bioavailability, reduced NO production, and asthma-like features. Reduced NO related bronchodilation and increased oxo-nitrosative stress may contribute to the pathogenesis.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Stress-related disease has become a global health problem. Mastication (chewing) is an effective behavior for coping with stress, likely due to the alterations chewing causes in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system. Mastication under stressful conditions attenuates stress-induced increases in plasma corticosterone and catecholamines, as well as the expression of stress-related substances, such as neurotrophic factors and nitric oxide. Further, chewing reduces stress-induced changes in central nervous system morphology, especially in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. In rodents, chewing or biting on wooden sticks during exposure to various stressors reduces stress-induced gastric ulcer formation and attenuates spatial cognitive dysfunction, anxiety-like behavior, and bone loss. In humans, some studies demonstrate that chewing gum during exposure to stress decreases plasma and salivary cortisol levels and reduces mental stress, although other studies report no such effect. Here, we discuss the neuronal mechanisms that underline the interactions between masticatory function and stress-coping behaviors in animals and humans.",eng,BioMed research international,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26085850,10.1007/s12561-014-9108-2,Quantifying Immune Response to Influenza Virus Infection via Multivariate Nonlinear ODE Models with Partially Observed State Variables and Time-Varying Parameters.,"Influenza A virus (IAV) infection continues to be a global health threat, as evidenced by the outbreak of the novel A/California/7/2009 IAV strain. Previous flu vaccines have proven less effective than hoped for emerging IAV strains, indicating a more thorough understanding of immune responses to primary infection is needed. One issue is the difficulty in directly measuring many key parameters and variables of the immune response. To address these issues, we considered a comprehensive workflow for statistical inference for ordinary differential question (ODE) models with partially observed variables and time-varying parameters, including identifiability analysis, two-stage and NLS estimation, and model selection etc‥ In particular, we proposed a novel one-step method to verify parameter identifiability and formulate estimating equations simultaneously. Thus, the pseudo-LS method can now deal with general ODE models with partially observed state variables for the first time. Using this workflow, we verified the relative significance of various immune factors to virus control, including target epithelial cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CD8+) cells and IAV specific antibodies (IgG and IgM). Factors other than cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) killing contributed the most to the loss of infected epithelial cells, though the effects of CTL are still significant. IgM antibody was found to be the major contributor to neutralization of free infectious viral particles. Also, the maximum viral load, which correlates well with mortality, was found to depend more on viral replication rates than infectivity. In contrast to current hypotheses, the results obtained via our methods suggest that IgM antibody and viral replication rates may be worth of further explorations in vaccine development.",eng,Statistics in biosciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In the last 2 decades, PCR- and sequence-based techniques, particularly whole-genome sequencing (WGS), have significantly furthered our knowledge of the genetic diversity, evolution, epidemiology, and pathogenicity of this once enigmatic pathogen. C. difficile is taxonomically distinct from many other well-known clostridia, with a diverse population structure comprising hundreds of strain types spread across at least 6 phylogenetic clades. The C. difficile species is defined by a large diverse pangenome with extreme levels of evolutionary plasticity that has been shaped over long time periods by gene flux and recombination, often between divergent lineages. These evolutionary events are in response to environmental and anthropogenic activities and have led to the rapid emergence and worldwide dissemination of virulent clonal lineages. Moreover, genome analysis of large clinically relevant data sets has improved our understanding of CDI outbreaks, transmission, and recurrence. The epidemiology of CDI has changed dramatically over the last 15 years, and CDI may have a foodborne or zoonotic etiology. The WGS era promises to continue to redefine our view of this significant pathogen.",eng,Clinical microbiology reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The moderate success of the RV144 Thai clinical vaccine trial suggested that vaccine-induced HIV-1-specific antibodies can reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection. We have made several improvements to the DNA platform and have previously shown that improved DNA vaccines alone are capable of inducing both binding and neutralizing antibodies in small-animal models. In this study, we explored how an improved DNA prime and recombinant protein boost would impact HIV-specific vaccine immunogenicity in rhesus macaques (RhM). After DNA immunization with either a single HIV Env consensus sequence or multiple constructs expressing HIV subtype-specific Env consensus sequences, we detected both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses to all vaccine immunogens. These T-cell responses were further increased after protein boosting to levels exceeding those of DNA-only or protein-only immunization. In addition, we observed antibodies that exhibited robust cross-clade binding and neutralizing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity after immunization with the DNA prime-protein boost regimen, with the multiple-Env formulation inducing a more robust and broader response than the single-Env formulation. The magnitude and functionality of these responses emphasize the strong priming effect improved DNA immunogens can induce, which are further expanded upon protein boost. These results support further study of an improved synthetic DNA prime together with a protein boost for enhancing anti-HIV immune responses.--NEW SECTION--Even with effective antiretroviral drugs, HIV remains an enormous global health burden. Vaccine development has been problematic in part due to the high degree of diversity and poor immunogenicity of the HIV Env protein. Studies suggest that a relevant HIV vaccine will likely need to induce broad cellular and humoral responses from a simple vaccine regimen due to the resource-limited setting in which the HIV pandemic is most rampant. DNA vaccination lends itself well to increasing the amount of diversity included in a vaccine due to the ease of manufacturing multiple plasmids and formulating them as a single immunization. By increasing the number of Envs within a formulation, we were able to show an increased breadth of responses as well as improved functionality induced in a nonhuman primate model. This increased breadth could be built upon, leading to better coverage against circulating strains with broader vaccine-induced protection.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Here, we performed an unbiased, mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to better understand the mucosal immunological processes underpinning this observed susceptibility to HIV infection. Cervicovaginal lavage samples (n = 19) were collected, characterized as follicular or luteal phase using days since last menstrual period, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Biological insights from these data were gained using a spectrum of computational methods, including hierarchical clustering, pathway analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and partial least-squares discriminant analysis with LASSO feature selection. Of the 384 proteins identified, 43 were differentially abundant between phases (P < 0.05, ≥2-fold change). Cell-cell adhesion proteins and antiproteases were reduced, and leukocyte recruitment (interleukin-8 pathway, P = 1.41E-5) and extravasation proteins (P = 5.62E-4) were elevated during the luteal phase. LASSO/PLSDA identified a minimal profile of 18 proteins that best distinguished the luteal phase. This profile included cytoskeletal elements and proteases known to be involved in cellular movement. Gene set enrichment analysis associated CD4(+) T cell and neutrophil gene set signatures with the luteal phase (P < 0.05). Taken together, our findings indicate a strong association between proteins involved in tissue remodeling and leukocyte infiltration with the luteal phase, which may represent potential hormone-associated mechanisms of increased susceptibility to HIV.--NEW SECTION--Recent studies have discovered an enhanced susceptibility to HIV infection during the progesterone-dominant luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. However, the mechanism responsible for this enhanced susceptibility has not yet been determined. Understanding the source of this vulnerability will be important for designing efficacious HIV prevention technologies for women. Furthermore, these findings may also be extrapolated to better understand the impact of exogenous hormone application, such as the use of hormonal contraceptives, on HIV acquisition risk. Hormonal contraceptives are the most widely used contraceptive method in sub-Saharan Africa, the most HIV-burdened area of the world. For this reason, research conducted to better understand how hormones impact host immunity and susceptibility factors important for HIV infection is a global health priority.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26084915,10.1111/maq.12229,The Global Context of Vaccine Refusal: Insights from a Systematic Comparative Ethnography of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.,"Many of medical anthropology's most pressing research questions require an understanding how infections, money and ideas move around the globe. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is a $9 billion project that has delivered 20 billion doses of oral polio vaccine in campaigns across the world. With its array of global activities, it cannot be comprehensively explored by the traditional anthropological method of research at one field site. This paper describes an ethnographic study of the GPEI, a collaborative effort between researchers at eight sites in seven countries. We developed a methodology grounded in nuanced understandings of local context but structured to allow analysis of global trends. Here, we examine polio vaccine acceptance and refusal to understand how global phenomena-in this case, policy decisions by donors and global health organizations to support vaccination campaigns rather than building health systems-shape local behavior.

We evaluated the effect of stunting on the outcomes of pneumonia among children enrolled in two large clinical trials.--NEW SECTION--We analysed data from two WHO and USAID-sponsored inpatient treatment trials, the Severe Pneumonia Evaluation Antimicrobial Research study (n = 958) and the Amoxicillin Penicillin Pneumonia International Study (n = 1702), which enrolled children aged 2-59 months across 16 sites in LMICs. We assessed the effect of stunting (height-for-age Z score < -2) on treatment outcome and time to resolution of hypoxaemic pneumonia.--NEW SECTION--Among 2542 (96%) children with valid data for height, 28% were stunted and 12.8% failed treatment by 5 days. The failure rate among stunted patients was 16.0% vs. 11.5% among non-stunted patients [unadjusted RR = 1.24 (95% CI 1.08, 1.41); adjusted RR = 1.28 (95% CI 1.10, 1.48)]. An inverse relationship was observed between height and failure rates, even among non-stunted children. Among 845 patients with hypoxaemic pneumonia, stunting was associated with a lower probability of normalisation of respiratory rate [HR = 0.63 (95% CI 0.52, 0.75)] and oxygen saturation [HR = 0.74 (95% CI 0.61, 0.89)].--NEW SECTION--Stunting increases the risk of treatment failure and is associated with a longer course of recovery in children with pneumonia.

26082035,10.1038/ncomms8491,Identification of mammalian-adapting mutations in the polymerase complex of an avian H5N1 influenza virus.,Avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype pose a serious global health threat due to the high mortality (>60%) associated with the disease caused by these viruses and the lack of protective antibodies to these viruses in the general population. The factors that enable avian H5N1 influenza viruses to replicate in humans are not completely understood. Here we use a high-throughput screening approach to identify novel mutations in the polymerase genes of an avian H5N1 virus that confer efficient polymerase activity in mammalian cells. Several of the identified mutations (which have previously been found in natural isolates) increase viral replication in mammalian cells and virulence in infected mice compared with the wild-type virus. The identification of amino-acid mutations in avian H5N1 influenza virus polymerase complexes that confer increased replication and virulence in mammals is important for the identification of circulating H5N1 viruses with an increased potential to infect humans.,eng,Nature communications,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26081904,10.1007/s11517-015-1323-6,RAIRS2 a new expert system for diagnosing tuberculosis with real-world tournament selection mechanism inside artificial immune recognition system.,"Tuberculosis is a major global health problem that has been ranked as the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide, after the human immunodeficiency virus. Diagnosis based on cultured specimens is the reference standard; however, results take weeks to obtain. Slow and insensitive diagnostic methods hampered the global control of tuberculosis, and scientists are looking for early detection strategies, which remain the foundation of tuberculosis control. Consequently, there is a need to develop an expert system that helps medical professionals to accurately diagnose the disease. The objective of this study is to diagnose tuberculosis using a machine learning method. Artificial immune recognition system (AIRS) has been used successfully for diagnosing various diseases. However, little effort has been undertaken to improve its classification accuracy. In order to increase the classification accuracy, this study introduces a new hybrid system that incorporates real tournament selection mechanism into the AIRS. This mechanism is used to control the population size of the model and to overcome the existing selection pressure. Patient epacris reports obtained from the Pasteur laboratory in northern Iran were used as the benchmark data set. The sample consisted of 175 records, from which 114 (65 %) were positive for TB, and the remaining 61 (35 %) were negative. The classification performance was measured through tenfold cross-validation, root-mean-square error, sensitivity, and specificity. With an accuracy of 100 %, RMSE of 0, sensitivity of 100 %, and specificity of 100 %, the proposed method was able to successfully classify tuberculosis cases. In addition, the proposed method is comparable with top classifiers used in this research.",eng,Medical & biological engineering & computing,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

An easily applied Abridged SimSmoke was developed to help countries gauge the effect of these policies using data from the WHO MPOWER/WHO Report (MPOWER Report) and is applied to four Eastern Mediterranean countries.--NEW SECTION--The number of smokers in a country is calculated using the country's smoking prevalence and population. Policy effect sizes, based on previously validated SimSmoke models, are applied to the smoker populations to determine the reduction in the number of smokers resulting from implementing policies. The number of smoking-attributable deaths is derived based on findings that half of those smokers alive today will die from smoking.--NEW SECTION--Within 40 years, implementing the complete set of MPOWER policies is projected to reduce smoking prevalence by 29% (range 15%, 41%) and avert almost 1 (range 0.5, 1.4) million deaths in Egypt, reduce smoking prevalence by 52% (range 36%, 66%) and avert 156 000 (106 000, 196 000) deaths in Lebanon, reduce smoking prevalence by 56% (range 40%, 69%) and avert 3.5 (range 2.5, 4.3) million deaths in Pakistan, and reduce smoking prevalence by 37% (range 21%, 51%) and avert 245 000 (range 138 000, 334 000) deaths in Tunisia.--NEW SECTION--The Abridged SimSmoke model has been used to show the number of deaths from smoking and how MPOWER policies can be used to reach the WHO non-communicable deaths voluntary target for cigarette use reduction in four countries.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, the relative cost-effectiveness of surgical delivery approaches remains largely unknown. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of two strategies of CLP surgical care delivery in low resource settings: medical mission and comprehensive care center. We evaluated the medical records and costs for 17 India-based medical missions and a Comprehensive Cleft Care Center in Guwahati, India, from Operation Smile, a humanitarian nongovernmental organization. Age, sex, diagnosis, and procedures were extracted and cost/Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted was calculated using a provider's perspective. The disability weights for CLP from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 update were used as the reference case. Sensitivity analysis was performed using various disability weights, age-weighting, discounting, and cost perspective. The medical missions treated 3503 patients for first-time cleft procedures and averted 6.00 DALYs per intervention with a cost-effectiveness of $247.42/DALY. The care center cohort included 2778 patients with first-time operations for CLP and averted a mean of 5.96 DALYs per intervention with a cost-effectiveness of $189.81/DALY. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of choosing medical mission over care center is $462.55. The care center provides cleft care with a higher cost-effectiveness, although both models are highly cost-effective in India, in accordance with WHO guidelines. Compared to other global health interventions, cleft care is very cost-effective and investment in cleft surgery might be realistic and achievable in similar resource-constrained environments.",eng,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

We aimed to provide information and guidelines for other interested programs on creating a global health elective in compliance with American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Residency Review Committee (ACGME/RRC) requirements.--NEW SECTION--A free-response survey was sent to all of the Plastic Surgery Residency program directors inquiring about their present policy on international mission trips for residents and faculty. Questions included time spent in mission, cases performed, sponsoring organizations, and whether cases are being counted in their resident Plastic Surgery Operative Logs (PSOL).--NEW SECTION--Thirty-one programs responded, with 23 programs presently sponsoring international mission trips. Thirteen programs support residents going on nonprogram-sponsored trips where the majority of these programs partner with outside organizations. Many programs do not count cases performed on mission trips as part of ACGME index case requirement. Application templates for international rotations to comply with ABPS and ACGME/RRC requirements were created to facilitate the participation of interested programs.--NEW SECTION--Many Plastic Surgery Residency programs are sponsoring international mission trips for their residents; however, there is a lack of uniformity and administrative support in pursuing these humanitarian efforts.

Many great targets and molecules have been reported to be involved in the initiation and/or progression of fibrosis, among which inflammation and oxidative stress are well-recognized modulation targets. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the third gasotransmitter with potent properties in inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress in various organs. Recent evidence suggests that plasma H2S level is decreased in various animal models of fibrotic diseases and supplement of exogenous H2S is able to ameliorate fibrosis in the kidney, lung, liver, and heart. This leads us to propose that modulation of H2S production may represent a promising therapeutic venue for the treatment of a variety of fibrotic diseases.

Yet, although these principles are widely accepted, they are criticized for not being specific enough to operationalize as post-2015 indicators for reaching the target of UHC. In this article, we propose measurable and achievable indicators for UHC based on the right to health that can be used to inform the ongoing negotiations on Sustainable Development Goals.

Interpersonal violence is now widely recognized as important global public health issues that can be addressed through evidence-based interventions. In South Africa, as in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), a lack of ongoing, systematic injury surveillance has limited the ability to characterize the burden of violence-related injury and to develop prevention programmes.--NEW SECTION--To describe the profile of trauma presenting to the trauma centre of Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa - relating to interpersonal violence, using data collected from a newly implemented surveillance system. Particular emphasis was placed on temporal aspects of injury epidemiology, as well as age and sex differentiation.--NEW SECTION--Data were collected prospectively using a standardized trauma admissions form for all patients presenting to the trauma centre. An epidemiological analysis was conducted on 16 months of data collected from June 2010 to October 2011.--NEW SECTION--A total of 8445 patients were included in the analysis, in which the majority were violence-related.

An intervention group of 360 primary care patients enrolled into a nurse-led continence care programme were recruited by consecutive sampling. A control group of 360 primary care patients with LUTS identified by screening were recruited from the waiting rooms of primary care clinics by consecutive sampling. Both groups were monitored at baseline and at 12 months.--NEW SECTION--Outcome measures included symptom severity, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), self-efficacy, global health and self-reported health service utilization at 12-months. The effect of the continence care programme on symptom severity and HRQOL was assessed by the difference-in-difference estimation, using independent t-test and multiple liner regression. Chi-square test was used to compare the self-efficacy, global health and self-reported health service utilization between the two groups at 12-months.--NEW SECTION--After adjusting for baseline severity and socio-demographics, the intervention group had significant improvements in LUTS severity (P<0.05) and HRQOL (P<0.05).

One approach to reducing health disparities involves mobilizing community coalitions that include representatives of target populations to plan and implement interventions for community level change. A systematic examination of coalition-led interventions is needed to inform decision making about the use of community coalition models.--NEW SECTION--To assess effects of community coalition-driven interventions in improving health status or reducing health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations.--NEW SECTION--We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, Social Science Citation Index, Dissertation Abstracts, System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) (from January 1990 through September 30, 2013), and Global Health Library (from January 1990 through March 31, 2014).--NEW SECTION--Cluster-randomized controlled trials, randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies, and prospective controlled cohort studies. Only studies of community coalitions with at least one racial or ethnic minority group representing the target population and at least two community public or private organizations are included. Major outcomes of interest are direct measures of health status, as well as lifestyle factors when evidence indicates that these have an effect on the direct measures performed.--NEW SECTION--Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each study.--NEW SECTION--Fifty-eight community coalition-driven intervention studies were included. No study was considered to be at low risk of bias. Behavioral change outcomes and health status change outcomes were analyzed separately. Outcomes are grouped by intervention type. Pooled effects across intervention types are not presented because the diverse community coalition-led intervention studies did not examine the same constructs or relationships, and they used dissimilar methodological designs. Broad-scale community system level change strategies led to little or no difference in measures of health behavior or health status (very low-certainty evidence). Broad health and social care system level strategies leds to small beneficial changes in measures of health behavior or health status in large samples of community residents (very low-certainty evidence). Lay community health outreach worker interventions led to beneficial changes in health behavior measures of moderate magnitude in large samples of community residents (very low-certainty evidence). Lay community health outreach worker interventions may lead to beneficial changes in health status measures in large samples of community residents; however, results were not consistent across studies (low-certainty evidence). Group-based health education led by professional staff resulted in moderate improvement in measures of health behavior (very low-certainty evidence) or health status (low-certainty evidence). Adverse outcomes of community coalition-led interventions were not reported.--NEW SECTION--Coalition-led interventions are characterized by connection of multi-sectoral networks of health and human service providers with ethnic and racial minority communities. These interventions benefit a diverse range of individual health outcomes and behaviors, as well as health and social care delivery systems. Evidence in this review shows that interventions led by community coalitions may connect health and human service providers with ethnic and racial minority communities in ways that benefit individual health outcomes and behaviors, as well as care delivery systems. However, because information on characteristics of the coalitions themselves is insufficient, evidence does not provide an explanation for the underlying mechanisms of beneficial effects. Thus, a definitive answer as to whether a coalition-led intervention adds extra value to the types of community engagement intervention strategies described in this review remains unattainable.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Identification of drug targets and novel antiflaviviral compounds to treat these diseases has become a global health imperative. A previous screen of 235,456 commercially available small molecules identified the 2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one family of compounds as inhibitors of the flaviviral NS5 capping enzyme, a promising target for antiviral drug development. Rational drug design methodologies enabled identification of lead compound BG-323 from this series. We have shown previously that BG-323 potently inhibits NS5 capping enzyme activity, displays antiviral effects in dengue virus replicon assays and inhibits growth of West Nile and yellow fever viruses with low cytotoxicity in vitro. In this study we further characterized BG-323's antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. We found that BG-323 was able to reduce replication of WNV (NY99) and Powassan viruses in culture, and we were unable to force resistance into WNV (Kunjin) in long-term culture experiments. We then evaluated the antiviral activity of BG-323 in a murine model. Mice were challenged with WNV NY99 and administered BG-323 or mock by IP inoculation immediately post challenge and twice daily thereafter. Mice were bled and viremia was quantified on day three. No significant differences in viremia were observed between BG-323-treated and control groups and clinical scores indicated both BG-323-treated and control mice developed signs of illness on approximately the same day post challenge. To determine whether differences in in vitro and in vivo efficacy were due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of BG-323, we conducted a pharmacokinetic evaluation of this small molecule. Insights from pharmacokinetic studies indicate that BG-323 is cell permeable, has a low efflux ratio and does not significantly inhibit two common cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) isoforms thus suggesting this molecule may be less likely to cause adverse drug interactions. However, the T1/2 of BG-323 was suboptimal and the percent of drug bound to plasma binding proteins was high. Future studies with BG-323 will be aimed at increasing the T1/2 and determining strategies for mitigating the effects of high plasma protein binding, which likely contribute to low in vivo efficacy.",eng,PloS one,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2015

As such, a better understanding of the basic immune mechanisms underlying disease pathology are key to developing therapeutic interventions to both prevent disease onset as well as to ameliorate disease morbidity in those individuals already suffering from a disorder linked to type-2 inflammation. Two factors central to type-2 immunity are interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, which have been linked to virtually all major hallmarks associated with type-2 inflammation. Therefore, IL-4 and IL-13 and their regulatory pathways represent ideal targets to suppress disease. Despite sharing many common regulatory pathways and receptors, these cytokines perform very distinct functions during a type-2 immune response. This review summarizes the literature surrounding the function and expression of IL-4 and IL-13 in CD4+ T cells and innate immune cells.

Thirty-seven program directors (63%) said global health was important to medical students when evaluating residency programs. Thirty-two program directors (55%) reported developing international electives. Reported barriers to resident participation in international electives were: 1) insufficient financial support, 2) inadequate resident coverage at home, and 3) lack of ACGME approval for international electives. Program directors requested more information about resident international electives, funding, and global ophthalmology educational resources. They requested ACGME recognition of international electives to facilitate resident participation. More than half (54%) of program directors supported international electives for residents.--NEW SECTION--This survey demonstrates that program directors believe global health is an important consideration when medical students evaluate training programs.

As clinical trials in humans require tremendous resources, preclinical drug and vaccine development largely relies on valid animal models that recapitulate the pathology of human disease and the immune responses of the host as closely as possible.--NEW SECTION--This review describes the animal models used in TB research, the most widely used being mice, guinea pigs and nonhuman primates. In addition, rabbits and cattle provide models with a disease pathology resembling that of humans. Invertebrate models, including the fruit fly and the Dictyostelium amoeba, have also been used to study mycobacterial infections. Recently, the zebrafish has emerged as a promising model for studying mycobacterial infections. The zebrafish model also facilitates the large-scale screening of drug and vaccine candidates.--NEW SECTION--Animal models are needed for TB research and provide valuable information on the mechanisms of the disease and on ways of preventing it. However, the data obtained in animal studies need to be carefully interpreted and evaluated before making assumptions concerning humans. With an increasing understanding of disease mechanisms, animal models can be further improved to best serve research goals.",eng,Expert opinion on drug discovery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The prominent increases in childhood overweight and obesity rates in the world even among youngest of children have translated into parallel increases in the prevalence of OSA, and such trends are undoubtedly associated with deleterious global health outcomes and life expectancy. Even an obesity phenotype in childhood OSA, more close to the adult type, has been recently proposed. Reciprocal interactions between sleep in general, OSA, obesity, and disruptions of metabolic homeostasis have emerged in recent years. These associations have suggested the a priori involvement of complex sets of metabolic and inflammatory pathways, all of which may underlie an increased risk for increased orexigenic behaviors and dysfunctional satiety, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance that ultimately favor the emergence of metabolic syndrome. Here, we review some of the critical evidence supporting the proposed associations between sleep disruption and the metabolism-obesity complex. In addition, we describe the more recent evidence linking the potential interactive roles of OSA and obesity on metabolic phenotype.",eng,Seminars in pediatric neurology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Outcomes for children include cognitive, behavioural, and emotional difficulties and, in low-income settings, perinatal depression is associated with stunting and physical illness. In the Victorian Intergenerational Health Cohort Study (VIHCS), we aimed to assess the extent to which women with perinatal depressive symptoms had a history of mental health problems before conception.--NEW SECTION--VIHCS is a follow-up study of participants in the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study (VAHCS), which was initiated in August, 1992, in the state of Victoria, Australia. In VAHCS, participants were assessed for health outcomes at nine timepoints (waves) from age 14 years to age 29 years. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule and the General Health Questionnaire. Enrolment to VIHCS began in September, 2006, during the ninth wave of VAHCS; depressive symptoms at this timepoint were measured with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. We contacted women every 6 months (from age 29 years to age 35 years) to identify any pregnancies. We assessed perinatal depressive symptoms with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) by computer-assisted telephone interview at 32 weeks of gestation, 8 weeks after birth, and 12 months after birth. We defined perinatal depression as an EPDS score of 10 or more.--NEW SECTION--From a stratified random sample of 1000 female participants in VAHCS, we enrolled 384 women with 564 pregnancies. 253 (66%) of these women had a previous history of mental health problems at some point in adolescence or young adulthood. 117 women with a history of mental health problems in both adolescence and young adulthood had 168 pregnancies, and perinatal depressive symptoms were reported for 57 (34%) of these pregnancies, compared with 16 (8%) of 201 pregnancies in 131 women with no preconception history of mental health problems (adjusted odds ratio 8·36, 95% CI 3·34-20·87). Perinatal depressive symptoms were reported at one or more assessment points in 109 pregnancies; a preconception history of mental health problems was reported in 93 (85%) of these pregnancies.--NEW SECTION--Perinatal depressive symptoms are mostly preceded by mental health problems that begin before pregnancy, in adolescence or young adulthood. Women with a history of persisting common mental disorders before pregnancy are an identifiable high-risk group, deserving of clinical support throughout the childbearing years. Furthermore, the window for considering preventive intervention for perinatal depression should extend to the time before conception.--NEW SECTION--National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia), Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, Colonial Foundation, Australian Rotary Health Research and Perpetual Trustees.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The study included 8130 women from 8 countries with information on sociodemographic factors, reproductive and sexual behaviour, smoking habit and HPV DNA through individual interviews. A blood sample was also collected to perform serological tests. We estimated the prevalence ratios associated to HCV to evaluate the effect of sexual behaviour in viral transmission.--NEW SECTION--Women were reactive to a minimum of two HCV antigens, including at least one non structural protein were considered as positive (33% of the samples were classified as positive, 40% as negative, and 27% as indeterminate (N=402), that were considered as not positive). The age-adjusted HCV seroprevalence varied significantly by regions (0.3% in Argentina to 21.1% in Nigeria).

26070414,10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.04.010,Composition and function of the undernourished neonatal mouse intestinal microbiome.,"Undernutrition remains one of the key global health challenges facing children today. Distinct microbial profiles have been associated with obesity and undernutrition, although mechanisms behind these associations are unknown. We sought to understand how protein-energy undernutrition alters the microbiome and to propose mechanisms by which these alterations influence the malnourished phenotype. Outbred CD1 neonatal mice were undernourished by timed separation from lactating dams, while control animals nursed ad libitum. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and compositional analysis identified microbes from luminal contents of ileum, cecum and colon, while whole metagenome shotgun sequencing identified microbial gene content. Our results suggest that the most important determinant of microbiome composition is body compartment; communities derived from ileum are distinct from those from cecum and colon as observed by phylogenetic clustering analysis. However, within each compartment, microbiota from undernourished and control mice cluster separately. At the phylum level, undernourished mice harbor more Verrucomicrobia and less Bacteroidetes in the distal intestine; these changes are driven by an increase in Akkermansia muciniphila and decreases in Bacteroides and Alistipes. Undernourished mice have an overall loss of microbial community richness and diversity and are deficient in multiple microbial genetic pathways including N-glycan, inositol phosphate and one-carbon metabolism. Losses in these microbial genes may confer less efficient extraction of energy from nondigestible dietary components including glycans and phytates, whereas epigenetic alterations provide a means of persistently altering metabolism even after adequate nutrition is restored. Thus, the microbiome of an undernourished host may perpetuate states of poor nutrition via multiple mechanisms.",eng,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The liver stage of Plasmodium falciparum infection is a leading target for immunological and pharmacological interventions. Therefore, novel approaches providing specific detection and isolation of live P. falciparum exoerythrocytic forms (EEFs) are warranted. Utilizing a recently generated parasite strain expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) we established a method which, allows for detection and isolation of developing live P. falciparum liver stages by flow cytometry. Using this technique we compared the susceptibility of five immortalized human hepatocyte cell lines and primary hepatocyte cultures from three donors to infection by P. falciparum sporozoites. Here, we show that EEFs can be detected and isolated from in vitro infected cultures of the HC-04 cell line and primary human hepatocytes. We confirmed the presence of developing parasites in sorted live human hepatocytes and characterized their morphology by fluorescence microscopy. Finally, we validated the practical applications of our approach by re-examining the importance of host ligand CD81 for hepatocyte infection by P. falciparum sporozoites in vitro and assessment of the inhibitory activity of anti-sporozoite antibodies. This methodology provides us with the tools to study both, the basic biology of the P. falciparum liver stage and the effects of host-derived factors on the development of P. falciparum EEFs.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

A Systematic Review.,"Infectious diseases elimination and eradication have become important areas of focus for global health and countries. Due to the substantial up-front investments required to eliminate and eradicate, and the overall shortage of resources for health, economic analysis can inform decision making on whether elimination/eradication makes economic sense and on the costs and benefits of alternative strategies. In order to draw lessons for current and future initiatives, we review the economic literature that has addressed questions related to the elimination and eradication of infectious diseases focusing on: why, how and for whom?--NEW SECTION--A systematic review was performed by searching economic literature (cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness and economic impact analyses) on elimination/eradication of infectious diseases published from 1980 to 2013 from three large bibliographic databases: one general (SCOPUS), one bio-medical (MEDLINE/PUBMED) and one economic (IDEAS/REPEC).--NEW SECTION--A total of 690 non-duplicate papers were identified from which only 43 met the inclusion criteria. In addition, only one paper focusing on equity issues, the ""for whom?"" question, was found. The literature relating to ""why?"" is the largest, much of it focusing on how much it would cost. A more limited literature estimates the benefits in terms of impact on economic growth with mixed results. The question of how to eradicate or eliminate was informed by an economic literature highlighting that there will be opportunities for individuals and countries to free-ride and that forms of incentives and/or disincentives will be needed. This requires government involvement at country level and global coordination. While there is little doubt that eliminating infectious diseases will eventually improve equity, it will only happen if active steps to promote equity are followed on the path to elimination and eradication.--NEW SECTION--The largest part of the literature has focused on costs and economic benefits of elimination/eradication. To a lesser extent, challenges associated with achieving elimination/eradication and ensuring equity have also been explored. Although elimination and eradication are, for some diseases, good investments compared with control, countries' incentives to eliminate do not always align with the global good and the most efficient elimination strategies may not prioritize the poorest populations. For any infectious disease, policy-makers will need to consider realigning contrasting incentives between the individual countries and the global community and to assure that the process towards elimination/eradication considers equity.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The relationships between clinical and quality of life variables were evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health domain--a validated surrogate variable for overall cancer patient well-being.--NEW SECTION--A cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate the determinants of global health in cancer patients who initiated treatment at two regional medical centers between January 2001 and December 2009. Variables analyzed included 15 EORTC QLQ-C30 scales, age at diagnosis, gender, newly diagnosed/ recurrent disease status, and stage. The decision tree algorithm, perhaps unfamiliar to practicing clinicians, evaluates the relative contribution of individual parameters in classifying a clinically meaningful functional endpoint, such as the global health of a patient.--NEW SECTION--Multiple patient characteristics were identified as important contributors. Fatigue, in particular, emerged as the most prevalent indicator of cancer patients' quality of life in 16/23 clinically relevant subsets. This analysis allowed results to be stated in a clinically-intuitive, rule set format using the language and quantities of the Quality of Life (QoL) tool itself.--NEW SECTION--By applying the classification algorithms to a large data set, identification of fatigue as a root factor in driving global health and overall QoL was revealed. The ability to practice mining of clinical data sets to uncover critical clinical insights that are immediately applicable to patient care practices is illustrated.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This ongoing clash has culminated in an environment where politicians most often no longer listen to scientists. Importation of Ebola virus to the United States prompted an immediate political fervor over travel bans, sealing off borders and disputes over the reliability of both quarantine and treatment protocol. This demonstrated that evidenced- based scientific discourse risks taking a back seat to political hyperbole and fear. The role of public health and medical expertise should be to ensure that cogent response strategies, based upon good science and accumulated knowledge and experience, are put in place to help inform the development of sound public policy. But in times of crisis, such reasoned expertise and experience are too often overlooked in favor of the partisan press ""sound bite"", where fear and insecurity have proved to be severely counterproductive. While scientists recognize that science cannot be entirely apolitical, the lessons from the impact of Ebola on political discourse shows that there is need for stronger engagement of the scientific community in crafting messages required for response to such events. This includes the creation of moral and ethical standards for the press, politicians and scientists, a partnership of confidence between the three that does not now exist and an ""elected officials"" toolbox that helps to translate scientific evidence and experience into readily acceptable policy and public communication.",eng,PLoS currents,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In particular, the emergence of β-lactamases has caused extensive resistance against the most frequently prescribed class of β-lactam antibiotics. Here, we develop novel synthetic peptide nucleic acid-based antisense inhibitors that target the start codon and ribosomal binding site of the TEM-1 β-lactamase transcript and act via translation inhibition mechanism. We show that these antisense inhibitors are capable of resensitizing drug-resistant Escherichia coli to β-lactam antibiotics exhibiting 10-fold reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). To study the mechanism of resistance, we adapted E. coli at MIC levels of the β-lactam/antisense inhibitor combination and observed a nonmutational, bet-hedging based adaptive antibiotic resistance response as evidenced by phenotypic heterogeneity as well as heterogeneous expression of key stress response genes.

Whilst a large number of IDs show global spatial variation, comprehensive knowledge of these geographic patterns is poor. Here we use an objective method to prioritise mapping efforts to begin to address the large deficit in global disease maps currently available.--NEW SECTION--Automation of ID mapping requires bespoke methodological adjustments tailored to the epidemiological characteristics of different types of diseases. Diseases were therefore grouped into 33 clusters based upon taxonomic divisions and shared epidemiological characteristics. Disability-adjusted life years, derived from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study, were used as a globally consistent metric of disease burden. A review of global health stakeholders, existing literature and national health priorities was undertaken to assess relative interest in the diseases. The clusters were ranked by combining both metrics, which identified 44 diseases of main concern within 15 principle clusters. Whilst malaria, HIV and tuberculosis were the highest priority due to their considerable burden, the high priority clusters were dominated by neglected tropical diseases and vector-borne parasites.--NEW SECTION--A quantitative, easily-updated and flexible framework for prioritising diseases is presented here. The study identifies a possible future strategy for those diseases where significant knowledge gaps remain, as well as recognising those where global mapping programs have already made significant progress.

In developing countries, Campylobacter infections are frequent in children under age two and may be associated with mortality. In developed countries, they are a common cause of bacterial diarrhea in early adulthood. In the United States, antibiotic resistance against Campylobacter is notably increased from 13% in 1997 to nearly 25% in 2011. Novel drug targets are urgently needed but remain a daunting task to accomplish. We suggest that omics-guided drug discovery is timely and worth considering in this context. The present study employed an integrated subtractive genomics and comparative metabolic pathway analysis approach. We identified 16 unique pathways from Campylobacter when compared against H. sapiens with 326 non-redundant proteins; 115 of these were found to be essential in the Database of Essential Genes. Sixty-six proteins among these were non-homologous to the human proteome. Six membrane proteins, of which four are transporters, have been proposed as potential vaccine candidates. Screening of 66 essential non-homologous proteins against DrugBank resulted in identification of 34 proteins with drug-ability potential, many of which play critical roles in bacterial growth and survival. Out of these, eight proteins had approved drug targets available in DrugBank, the majority serving crucial roles in cell wall synthesis and energy metabolism and therefore having the potential to be utilized as drug targets. We conclude by underscoring that screening against these proteins with inhibitors may aid in future discovery of novel therapeutics against campylobacteriosis in ways that will be pathogen specific, and thus have minimal toxic effect on host. Omics-guided drug discovery and bioinformatics analyses offer the broad potential for veritable advances in global health relevant novel therapeutics.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Recognizing the potential benefits of mobile health information technology, a paper-based decision aid was transformed into a secure, interactive Web site to meet the diverse needs of women and providers in this often challenging health care decision.--NEW SECTION--An iterative and participatory research approach was used, engaging targeted users (pregnant women and pregnancy care providers) in the design and development process.--NEW SECTION--Women recommended that features and functions of the decision aid should include individualized information, trustworthy evidence, a secure and private site, quizzes to check knowledge, and a way to share values and preferences with their providers. Providers recommended individualized information for women, a process for women to share and document values and preferences with providers, and balanced, straightforward and complete information about the risks and benefits of each option.--NEW SECTION--There is great potential for direct linkage between Internet-based decision aids and the electronic medical record. Work is currently underway to integrate and evaluate the Internet-based decision aid within busy practice settings to support shared decision making. This article is part of a special series of articles that address midwifery innovations in clinical practice, education, interprofessional collaboration, health policy, and global health.",eng,Journal of midwifery & women's health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

26056825,10.1371/journal.pone.0128785,Intranasal Immunization with Pressure Inactivated Avian Influenza Elicits Cellular and Humoral Responses in Mice.,"Influenza viruses pose a serious global health threat, particularly in light of newly emerging strains, such as the avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. Vaccination remains the primary method for preventing acquiring influenza or for avoiding developing serious complications related to the disease. Vaccinations based on inactivated split virus vaccines or on chemically inactivated whole virus have some important drawbacks, including changes in the immunogenic properties of the virus. To induce a greater mucosal immune response, intranasally administered vaccines are highly desired as they not only prevent disease but can also block the infection at its primary site. To avoid these drawbacks, hydrostatic pressure has been used as a potential method for viral inactivation and vaccine production. In this study, we show that hydrostatic pressure inactivates the avian influenza A H3N8 virus, while still maintaining hemagglutinin and neuraminidase functionalities. Challenged vaccinated animals showed no disease signs (ruffled fur, lethargy, weight loss, and huddling). Similarly, these animals showed less Evans Blue dye leakage and lower cell counts in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with the challenged non-vaccinated group. We found that the whole inactivated particles were capable of generating a neutralizing antibody response in serum, and IgA was also found in nasal mucosa and feces. After the vaccination and challenge we observed Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion with a prevalence of IFN-γ. Our data indicate that the animals present a satisfactory immune response after vaccination and are protected against infection. Our results may pave the way for the development of a novel pressure-based vaccine against influenza virus.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Although the financial implications of such partnerships have been analyzed, few studies have examined the partnerships' impact on clinical performance outcomes. Using quantitative measures that reflected capacity, utilization, clinical quality, and patient outcomes, we compared a government-managed hospital network in Lesotho, Africa, and the new PPP-managed hospital network that replaced it. In addition, we used key informant interviews to help explain differences in performance. We found that the PPP-managed network delivered more and higher-quality services and achieved significant gains in clinical outcomes, compared to the government-managed network. We conclude that health care public-private partnerships may improve hospital performance in developing countries and that changes in management and leadership practices might account for differences in clinical outcomes.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This investment has generated significant health gains, but much less is known about PEPFAR's population-level economic effects. We used a difference-in-differences approach to compare employment trends between ten countries that received a large amount of PEPFAR funding (focus countries) and eleven countries that received little or no funding (control countries). We found that PEPFAR was associated with a 13 percent differential increase in employment among males in focus countries, compared to control countries. However, we observed no change in employment among females. In addition, we found that increasing PEPFAR per capita funding by $100 was associated with a 9.1-percentage-point increase in employment among males. This rise in employment generates economic benefits equal to half of PEPFAR's cost. These findings suggest that PEPFAR's economic impact should be taken into account when making aid allocation decisions.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We hypothesized that most surgery programs do not have international training or do not provide the information to prospective applicants regarding electives or programs in an easily accessible manner via Web-based resources.--NEW SECTION--Individual general surgery program Web sites and the American College of Surgeons residency tool were used to identify 239 residencies. The homepages were examined for specific mention of international or global health programs. Ease of access was also considered. Global surgery specific pages or centers were noted. Programs were assessed for length of rotation, presence of research component, and mention of benefits to residents and respective institution.--NEW SECTION--Of 239 programs, 24 (10%) mentioned international experiences on their home page and 42 (18%) contained information about global surgery. Of those with information available, 69% were easily accessible. Academic programs were more likely than independent programs to have information about international opportunities on their home page (13.7% versus 4.0%, P = 0.006) and more likely to have a dedicated program or pathway Web site (18.8% versus 2.0%, P < 0.0001). Half of the residencies with global surgery information did not have length of rotation available. Research was only mentioned by 29% of the Web sites. Benefits to high-income country residents were discussed more than benefits to low- and middle-income country residents (57% versus 17%).--NEW SECTION--General surgery residency programs do not effectively communicate international opportunities for prospective residents through Web-based resources and should seriously consider integrating international options into their curriculum and better present them on department Web sites.",eng,The Journal of surgical research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still diagnosed at intermediate or advanced disease stages, where curative approaches are often not feasible. Among the treatment options available, the molecular targeted agent sorafenib is able to significantly increase overall survival in these patients. Thereafter, up to seven large, randomized phase III clinical trials investigating other molecular therapies in the first-line and second-line settings have failed to improve on the results observed with this agent. Potential reasons for this include intertumour heterogeneity, issues with trial design and a lack of predictive biomarkers of response. During the past 5 years, substantial advances in our knowledge of the human genome have provided a comprehensive picture of commonly mutated genes in patients with HCC. This knowledge has not yet influenced clinical decision-making or current clinical practice guidelines. In this Review the authors summarize the molecular concepts of progression, discuss the potential reasons for clinical trial failure and propose new concepts of drug development, which might lead to clinical implementation of emerging targeted agents.",eng,Nature reviews.

Many of these deaths could be prevented by providing temperature stability, respiratory support, hydration and nutrition; preventing and treating infections; and diagnosing and treating neonatal jaundice and hypoglycaemia. Most neonatal health-care technologies which help to accomplish these tasks are designed for high-income countries and are either unavailable or unsuitable in low-resource settings, preventing many neonates from receiving the gold standard of care. There is an urgent need for neonatal health-care technologies which are low-cost, robust, simple to use and maintain, affordable and able to operate from various power supplies. Several technologies have been designed to meet these requirements or are currently under development; however, unmet technology needs remain. The distribution of an integrated set of technologies, rather than separate components, is essential for effective implementation and a substantial impact on neonatal health. Close collaboration between stakeholders at all stages of the development process and an increased focus on implementation research are necessary for effective and sustainable implementation.",eng,Paediatrics and international child health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Patients received 5-day aromatherapy treatment using either ginger essential oil or fragrance-matched artificial placebo (ginger fragrance oil) which was instilled in a necklace in an order dictated by the treatment group sequence.--NEW SECTION--Two oncology clinics in the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia.--NEW SECTION--VAS nausea score, frequency of vomiting and HRQoL profile (EORTC QLQ-C30 scores).--NEW SECTION--Sixty female patients completed the study (age=47.3±9.26 years; Malay=98.3%; on highly emetogenic chemotherapy=86.7%). The VAS nausea score was significantly lower after ginger essential oil inhalation compared to placebo during acute phase (P=0.040) but not sustained for overall treatment effect (treatment effect: F=1.82, P=0.183; time effect: F=43.98, P<0.001; treatment×time effect: F=2.04; P=0.102). Similarly, there was no significant effect of aromatherapy on vomiting [F(1, 58)=0.29, P=0.594]. However, a statistically significant change from baseline for global health status (P<0.001) was detected after ginger essential oil inhalation. A clinically relevant 10 points improvement on role functioning (P=0.002) and appetite loss (P<0.001) were also documented while patients were on ginger essential oil.--NEW SECTION--At present time, the evidence derived from this study is not sufficiently convincing that inhaled ginger aromatherapy is an effective complementary therapy for CINV.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether homeopathy influenced global health status and subjective wellbeing when used as an adjunct to conventional cancer therapy.--NEW SECTION--In this pragmatic randomized controlled trial, 410 patients, who were treated by standard anti-neoplastic therapy, were randomized to receive or not receive classical homeopathic adjunctive therapy in addition to standard therapy. The study took place at the Medical University Vienna, Department of Medicine I, Clinical Division of Oncology.--NEW SECTION--The main outcome measures were global health status and subjective wellbeing as assessed by the patients. At each of three visits (one baseline, two follow-up visits), patients filled in two different questionnaires.--NEW SECTION--373 patients yielded at least one of three measurements. The improvement of global health status between visits 1 and 3 was significantly stronger in the homeopathy group by 7.7 (95% CI 2.3-13.0, p=0.005) when compared with the control group.

Despite multiple years of research, sustainable arsenic treatment technologies have yet to be developed. This study demonstrates the intrinsic abilities of cupric oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NP) towards arsenic adsorption and the development of a point-of-use filter for field application. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments were used to examine adsorption, desorption, and readsorption of aqueous arsenite and arsenate by CuO-NP. Field experiments were conducted with a point-of-use filter, coupled with real-time arsenic monitoring, to remove arsenic from domestic groundwater samples. The CuO-NP were regenerated by desorbing arsenate via increasing pH above the zero point of charge. Results suggest an effective oxidation of arsenite to arsenate on the surface of CuO-NP. Naturally occurring arsenic was effectively removed by both as-prepared and regenerated CuO-NP in a field demonstration of the point-of-use filter.

We assessed the effectiveness of bioactive polyphenols contained in solution (LX) to restore normal bowel function in pediatric patients with acute diarrhea. Background. While providing oral rehydration solution (ORS) is standard treatment for diarrhea in developing countries, plant-derived products have been shown to positively affect intestinal function. If a supplement to ORS resolves diarrhea more rapidly than ORS alone, it is an improvement to current care. Study. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study, 61 pediatric patients with uncontrolled diarrhea were randomized to receive either ORS + LX on day 1 and then ORS + water on day 2 (study arm) or ORS + water on day 1 and then ORS + LX on day 2 (control arm). Time to resolution and number of bowel movements were recorded. Results. On day 1, the mean time to diarrhea resolution was 3.1 h (study arm) versus 9.2 h (control arm) (p = 0.002). In the study arm, 60% of patients had normal stool at their first bowel movement after consumption of the phenolic redoxigen solution (LX). On day 2, patients in the study arm continued to have normal stool while patients in the control arm achieved normal stool within 24 h after consuming the test solution. Patients in the control arm experienced a reduction in the mean number of bowel movements from day 1 to day 2 after consuming the test solution (p = 0.0001). No adverse events were observed.

Non-randomized studies investigating the mid-term quality of life after MIE show conflicting results at 1-year follow-up. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether MIE has a continuing better mid-term 1-year quality of life than open esophagectomy (OE) indicating both a faster recovery and less procedure-related symptoms.--NEW SECTION--A one-year follow-up analysis of the quality of life was conducted for patients participating in the randomized trial in which MIE was compared with OE. Late complications as symptomatic stenosis of anastomosis are also reported.--NEW SECTION--Quality of life at 1 year was better in the MIE group than in the OE group for the physical component summary SF36 [50 (6; 48-53) versus 45 (9; 42-48) p .003]; global health C30 [79 (10; 76-83) versus 67 (21; 60-75) p .004]; and pain OES18 module [6 (9; 2-8) versus 16 (16; 10-22) p .001], respectively.

26036882,NA,Telephone reminders reduced the non-attendance rate in a gastroenterology outpatient clinic.,"Non-attendance is a global health-care problem. The aim of the present study was 1) to investigate if a telephone reminder could reduce the non-attendance rate, 2) to study reasons for non-attendance and 3) to evaluate if a permanent implementation would be economically advantageous in a gastroenterology outpatient clinic like ours.--NEW SECTION--This was a comparative intervention study with a historical control group in a gastroenterology outpatient clinic. The study lasted six months. Patients with a scheduled appointment in the first three-month period received no reminder (control group, n = 2,705). Patients in the following three-month period were reminded by telephone one weekday in advance of their appointment, when possible (intervention group, n = 2,479). Non-attending patients in the intervention group received a questionnaire. Based on the results, a financial cost-benefit analysis was made.--NEW SECTION--In the intervention group, 1,577 (64%) patients answered the reminder telephone call. The non-attendance rate was significantly lower in the intervention group (6.1%) than in the control group (10.5%) (p < 0.00001). Only 1.3% of the patients who answered the reminder turned out to be non-attendees. The most common explanation for non-attendance in the intervention group was forgetfulness (39%). The reminder telephone call was cost-effective.--NEW SECTION--In this outpatient clinic, telephone reminders were cost-effective and significantly reduced the non-attendance rate by 43%.",eng,Danish medical journal,Clinical Study,2025-04-23,2015

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the role of second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure as a risk factor for TB among children and adults.--NEW SECTION--We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to August 31, 2014. Our a priori inclusion criteria encompassed only original studies where latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB disease were diagnosed microbiologically, clinically, histologically, or radiologically. Effect estimates were pooled using fixed- and random-effects models. We identified 18 eligible studies, with 30,757 children and 44,432 adult non-smokers, containing SHS exposure and TB outcome data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Twelve studies assessed children and eight studies assessed adult non-smokers; two studies assessed both populations. Summary relative risk (RR) of LTBI associated with SHS exposure in children was similar to the overall effect size, with high heterogeneity (pooled RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.00-2.83). Children showed a more than 3-fold increased risk of SHS-associated active TB (pooled RR 3.41, 95% CI 1.81-6.45), which was higher than the risk in adults exposed to SHS (summary RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.68). Positive and significant exposure-response relationships were observed among children under 5 y (RR 5.88, 95% CI 2.09-16.54), children exposed to SHS through any parent (RR 4.20, 95% CI 1.92-9.20), and children living under the most crowded household conditions (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.36-12.98). Associations for LTBI and active TB disease remained significant after adjustment for age, biomass fuel (BMF) use, and presence of a TB patient in the household, although the meta-analysis was limited to a subset of studies that adjusted for these variables. There was a loss of association with increased risk of LTBI (but not active TB) after adjustment for socioeconomic status (SES) and study quality. The major limitation of this analysis is the high heterogeneity in outcomes among studies of pediatric cases of LTBI and TB disease.--NEW SECTION--We found that SHS exposure is associated with an increase in the relative risk of LTBI and active TB after controlling for age, BMF use, and contact with a TB patient, and there was no significant association of SHS exposure with LTBI after adjustment for SES and study quality. Given the high heterogeneity among the primary studies, our analysis may not show sufficient evidence to confirm an association. In addition, considering that the TB burden is highest in countries with increasing SHS exposure, it is important to confirm these results with higher quality studies. Research in this area may have important implications for TB and tobacco control programs, especially for children in settings with high SHS exposure and TB burden.",eng,PLoS medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Zinc supplementation is regarded as a powerful tool to correct zinc deficiency as well as to treat a variety of physiologic and pathologic conditions. However, the dose and frequency of its use as well as the choice of zinc salt are not clearly defined regardless of whether it is used to treat a disease or correct a nutritional deficiency. We discuss the application of zinc stable isotope tracer techniques to assess zinc physiology, metabolism and homeostasis and how these can address knowledge gaps in zinc supplementation pharmacokinetics. This may help to resolve optimal dose, frequency, length of administration, timing of delivery to food intake and choice of zinc compound. It appears that long-term preventive supplementation can be administered much less frequently than daily but more research needs to be undertaken to better understand how best to intervene with zinc in children at risk of zinc deficiency. Stable isotope techniques, linked with saturation response and compartmental modelling, also have the potential to assist in the continued search for simple markers of zinc status in health, malnutrition and disease.",eng,Nutrients,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Children are much more susceptible to HIV-1 neurological impairments than adults, which can be exacerbated by coinfections. Neurological characteristics of pediatric HIV-1 infection suggest dysfunction in the frontal cortex as well as the hippocampus; limited MRI data indicate global cerebral atrophy, and pathological data suggest accelerated neuronal apoptosis in the cortex. An obstacle to pediatric HIV-1 research is a human representative model system. Host-species specificity of HIV-1 limits the ability to model neurological consequences of pediatric HIV-1 infection in animals. Several models have been proposed including neonatal intracranial injections of HIV-1 viral proteins in rats and perinatal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of infant macaques. Nonhuman primate models recapitulate the complexity of pediatric HIV-1 neuropathogenesis while rodent models are able to elucidate the role specific viral proteins exert on neurodevelopment. Nonhuman primate models show similar behavioral and neuropathological characteristics to pediatric HIV-1 infection and offer a stage to investigate early viral mechanisms, latency reservoirs, and therapeutic interventions.

The extensive use of antimicrobial chemotherapy in clinical environments is considered a factor associated with the enhanced occurrence of antimicrobial resistance.--NEW SECTION--The autoregressive integrated moving average model was used to forecast the trend of drug resistance of AB in the coming years, combined with assessment of relationships between antibiotic consumption and AB resistance to set appropriate antibiotic use.--NEW SECTION--A total of 4,377 AB isolates were collected and were associated with a resistance rate of >80% of major antibiotics. A significant increase in resistance in AB to cefoperazone-sulbactam (C-S) (r(2) = 0.98, P = .001) was observed. C-S consumption was correlated with the development of resistance in AB (r = 0.99, P = .02). From 2009-2012, the percentage of AB resistance to C-S was <35%; however, it increased sharply (67.3%) because the annual consumption of C-S was >20 defined daily dose (DDD)/1,000 patient days in 2013.Increased consumption of C-S may contribute to the emergence of multidrug-resistant AB and the increasing prevalence of hospital-acquired infection.--NEW SECTION--A recommendation of limiting the use of C-S to <20 DDD/1,000 patient days annually was proposed for inhibiting the sharp increment of the AB resistance rate in our hospital.",eng,American journal of infection control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In that trial, progression-free survival was significantly improved in the pazopanib arm (median, 4.6 vs 1.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.31; P < .001), and toxicity of pazopanib consisted mainly of fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, weight loss, and hypertension.--NEW SECTION--HRQoL was assessed using the 30-item core European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12 in patients who received treatment on protocol. The primary HRQoL endpoint was the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status scale.--NEW SECTION--Compliance with HRQoL assessments was good, ranging from 94% at baseline to 81% at week 12. Differences in scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status subscale between the 2 treatment arms were not statistically significant and did not exceed the predetermined, minimal clinically important difference of 10 points (P = .291; maximum difference, 3.8 points).

Nonetheless, the percentage of midwives who self-identify as primary care providers is decreasing. Dedicated primary care educational experiences may increase student confidence and encourage the incorporation of primary care into midwifery practice after graduation.--NEW SECTION--Midwifery students in 2 cohorts completed questionnaires before and after a dedicated primary care practicum to study changes in the perceived level of confidence in primary care provision. The students in cohort A participated in 45 hours of primary care clinical time, whereas the students in cohort B participated in 88 hours of primary care clinical time.

These pathogens live in mosquitoes and hosts that interact in spatially heterogeneous environments where hosts move between regions of varying transmission intensity. Although there is increasing interest in the implications of spatial processes for mosquito-borne disease dynamics, most of our understanding derives from models that assume spatially homogeneous transmission. Spatial variation in contact rates can influence transmission and the risk of epidemics, yet the interaction between spatial heterogeneity and movement of hosts remains relatively unexplored. Here we explore, analytically and through numerical simulations, how human mobility connects spatially heterogeneous mosquito populations, thereby influencing disease persistence (determined by the basic reproduction number R0), prevalence and their relationship. We show that, when local transmission rates are highly heterogeneous, R0 declines asymptotically as human mobility increases, but infection prevalence peaks at low to intermediate rates of movement and decreases asymptotically after this peak. Movement can reduce heterogeneity in exposure to mosquito biting. As a result, if biting intensity is high but uneven, infection prevalence increases with mobility despite reductions in R0. This increase in prevalence decreases with further increase in mobility because individuals do not spend enough time in high transmission patches, hence decreasing the number of new infections and overall prevalence. These results provide a better basis for understanding the interplay between spatial transmission heterogeneity and human mobility, and their combined influence on prevalence and R0.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Therefore, there has been a pressing need for the development of new booster vaccines to enhance existing BCG-induced immunity. Protection following mucosal intranasal immunisation with AdHu5Ag85A is associated with the localisation of antigen-specific T-cells to the lung airway. However, parenteral intramuscular immunisation is unable to provide protection despite the apparent presence of antigen-specific T-cells in the lung interstitium. Recent advances in intravascular staining have allowed us to reassess the previously established T-cell distribution profile and its relationship with the observed differential protection. Respiratory mucosal immunisation empowers T-cells to home to both the lung interstitium and the airway lumen, whereas intramuscular immunisation-activated T-cells are largely trapped within the pulmonary vasculature, unable to populate the lung interstitium and airway.

26028411,10.1248/yakushi.14-00250-1,[Role of the sweet taste receptor in glucose metabolism: no sweets for diabetes?].,"Type 2 diabetes is closely associated with our daily diets and has become a global health problem with increasing number of patients. Maintaining energy homeostasis is essentially required for the treatment of diabetes. Energy metabolism starts with taking in a meal. Nutrients including amino acids, fatty acids and glucose in the digest have been shown to act on the neuroendocrine cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and thereby play important roles in energy homeostasis. Therefore, the GI tract is now recognized as a sensor system for nutrient signals. Taste receptor type 1 member 2 (T1R2) is known to function as a co-receptor with T1R3 to detect sweet chemicals in the taste buds. It has been proposed that the T1R2/T1R3 receptor complex acts as sweet sensor in the intestine, and plays a pivotal role in sensing sugars and maintaining glucose homeostasis through incretin secretion. To clarify the physiological roles of T1R2 in glucose homeostasis, T1r2-lacZ knock-in/knock-out mice were generated. We found lacZ gene expression in the GI tract where T1r3 expression has been reported. Interestingly, the T1r2-lacZ knock-in mice showed impaired glucose tolerance on oral glucose challenge but not on intraperitoneal injection. However, the fasting glucose level in T1r2-lacZ knock-in mice was comparable to that in wild type mice. These results suggest an important role of the sweet taste receptor system in the intestine when stimulated by glucose. Therefore, the roles of T1R2 will be presented and the mechanism for metabolic homeostasis will be discussed.",jpn,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The serum activity of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) were also measured. Anti-HCV and anti-HBc antibodies were detected in 34% and 48% of patients, respectively, and 70.6% of anti-HCV positive patients were also positive for anti-HBc antibodies. This association was statistically significant (p=0.001). HBV DNA was detected in 32% of the hemodialysis patients. A significant association was determined between the presence of HBV DNA and anti-HCV positivity (p=0.021). Aminotransferases were elevated in 21% of the studied patients, more often in patients with positive anti-HCV profiles than in patients negative for anti-HCV (p<0.05). In conclusion, the serological markers of HBV infection should be verified with molecular tests to investigate possible occult infections, especially among anti-HBc-positive hemodialysis patients, to improve our understanding of their clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological characteristics.",eng,Journal of infection and public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26026158,10.1093/jamia/ocv015,Smartphone-based diagnostic for preeclampsia: an mHealth solution for administering the Congo Red Dot (CRD) test in settings with limited resources.,"Morbidity and mortality due to preeclampsia in settings with limited resources often results from delayed diagnosis. The Congo Red Dot (CRD) test, a simple modality to assess the presence of misfolded proteins in urine, shows promise as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for preeclampsia. We propose an innovative mobile health (mHealth) solution that enables the quantification of the CRD test as a batch laboratory test, with minimal cost and equipment.--NEW SECTION--A smartphone application that guides the user through seven easy steps, and that can be used successfully by non-specialized personnel, was developed. After image acquisition, a robust analysis runs on a smartphone, quantifying the CRD test response without the need for an internet connection or additional hardware. In the first stage, the basic image processing algorithms and supporting test standardizations were developed using urine samples from 218 patients. In the second stage, the standardized procedure was evaluated on 328 urine specimens from 273 women. In the third stage, the application was tested for robustness using four different operators and 94 altered samples.--NEW SECTION--In the first stage, the image processing chain was set up with high correlation to manual analysis (z-test P < 0.001). In the second stage, a high agreement between manual and automated processing was calculated (Lin's concordance coefficient ρc = 0.968). In the last stage, sources of error were identified and remedies were developed accordingly. Altered samples resulted in an acceptable concordance with the manual gold-standard (Lin's ρc = 0.914).--NEW SECTION--Combining smartphone-based image analysis with molecular-specific disease features represents a cost-effective application of mHealth that has the potential to fill gaps in access to health care solutions that are critical to reducing adverse events in resource-poor settings.",eng,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26025969,10.1074/mcp.M115.051151,Profiling the Proteome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during Dormancy and Reactivation.,"Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, still remains a major global health problem. The main obstacle in eradicating this disease is the ability of this pathogen to remain dormant in macrophages, and then reactivate later under immuno-compromised conditions. The physiology of hypoxic nonreplicating M. tuberculosis is well-studied using many in vitro dormancy models. However, the physiological changes that take place during the shift from dormancy to aerobic growth (reactivation) have rarely been subjected to a detailed investigation. In this study, we developed an in vitro reactivation system by re-aerating the virulent laboratory strain of M. tuberculosis that was made dormant employing Wayne's dormancy model, and compared the proteome profiles of dormant and reactivated bacteria using label-free one-dimensional LC/MS/MS analysis. The proteome of dormant bacteria was analyzed at nonreplicating persistent stage 1 (NRP1) and stage 2 (NRP2), whereas that of reactivated bacteria was analyzed at 6 and 24 h post re-aeration. Proteome of normoxially grown bacteria served as the reference. In total, 1871 proteins comprising 47% of the M. tuberculosis proteome were identified, and many of them were observed to be expressed differentially or uniquely during dormancy and reactivation. The number of proteins detected at different stages of dormancy (764 at NRP1, 691 at NRP2) and reactivation (768 at R6 and 983 at R24) was very low compared with that of the control (1663). The number of unique proteins identified during normoxia, NRP1, NRP2, R6, and R24 were 597, 66, 56, 73, and 94, respectively. We analyzed various biological functions during these conditions. Fluctuation in the relative quantities of proteins involved in energy metabolism during dormancy and reactivation was the most significant observation we made in this study. Proteins that are up-regulated or uniquely expressed during reactivation from dormancy offer to be attractive targets for therapeutic intervention to prevent reactivation of latent tuberculosis.",eng,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26024349,10.1055/s-0035-1549455,Ambient particulate matter air pollution and cardiopulmonary diseases.,"Population exposures to ambient outdoor particulate matter (PM) air pollution have been assessed to represent a major burden on global health. Ambient PM is a diverse class of air pollution, with characteristics and health implications that can vary depending on a host of factors, including a particle's original source of emission or formation. The penetration of inhaled particles into the thorax is dependent on their deposition in the upper respiratory tract during inspiration, which varies with particle size, flow rate and tidal volume, and in vivo airway dimensions. All of these factors can be quite variable from person to person, depending on age, transient illness, cigarette smoke and other short-term toxicant exposures that cause transient bronchoconstriction, and occupational history associated with loss of lung function or cumulative injury. The adverse effects of inhaled PM can result from both short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) exposures to PM, and can range from relatively minor, such as increased symptoms, to very severe effects, including increased risk of premature mortality and decreased life expectancy from long-term exposure. Control of the most toxic PM components can therefore provide major health benefits, and can help guide the selection of the most human health optimal air quality control and climate change mitigation policy measures. As such, a continued improvement in our understanding of the nature and types of PM that are most dangerous to health, and the mechanism(s) of their respective health effects, is an important public health goal.",eng,Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Diagnosis based on cultured specimens is the reference standard, however results take weeks to process. Scientists are looking for early detection strategies, which remain the cornerstone of tuberculosis control. Consequently there is a need to develop an expert system that helps medical professionals to accurately and quickly diagnose the disease. Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) has been used successfully for diagnosing various diseases. However, little effort has been undertaken to improve its classification accuracy.--NEW SECTION--In order to increase the classification accuracy of AIRS, this study introduces a new hybrid system that incorporates a support vector machine into AIRS for diagnosing tuberculosis.--NEW SECTION--Patient epacris reports obtained from the Pasteur laboratory of Iran were used as the benchmark data set, with the sample size of 175 (114 positive samples for TB and 60 samples in the negative group). The strategy of this study was to ensure representativeness, thus it was important to have an adequate number of instances for both TB and non-TB cases. The classification performance was measured through 10-fold cross-validation, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), sensitivity and specificity, Youden's Index, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Statistical analysis was done using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA), a machine learning program for windows.--NEW SECTION--With an accuracy of 100%, sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 100%, Youden's Index of 1, Area Under the Curve of 1, and RMSE of 0, the proposed method was able to successfully classify tuberculosis patients.--NEW SECTION--There have been many researches that aimed at diagnosing tuberculosis faster and more accurately. Our results described a model for diagnosing tuberculosis with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This model can be used as an additional tool for experts in medicine to diagnose TBC more accurately and quickly.",eng,Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The severity of typhoid is often underestimated, and currently available serological diagnostic assays are inadequate due to lack in requisite sensitivity and specificity. This underlines an absolute need to develop a reliable and accurate diagnostics that would benefit long-term disease control and treatment and to understand the real disease burden. Here, we have utilized flagellin protein of S. typhi that is surface accessible, abundantly expressed, and highly immunogenic, for developing immunodiagnostic tests. Flagellin monomers are composed of conserved amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal, and serovar-specific middle region. We have generated a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the middle region of flagellin, purified from large culture of S. typhi to ensure its native conformation. These mAbs showed unique specificity and very high affinity toward S. typhi flagellin without showing any cross-reactivity with other serovars. Genetic analysis of mAbs also revealed high frequency of somatic mutation due to antigenic selection process across variable region to achieve high binding affinity. These antibodies also displayed stable binding in stringent reaction conditions for antigen-antibody interactions, like DMSO, urea, KSCN, guanidinium HCl, and extremes of pH. One of the mAbs potentially reversed the TLR5-mediated immune response, in vitro by inhibiting TLR5-flagellin interaction. In our study, binding of these mAbs to flagellin, with high affinity, present on bacterial surface, as well as in soluble form, validates their potential use in developing improved diagnostics with significantly higher sensitivity and specificity.",eng,Immunologic research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The loss of susceptibility to an increasing number of drugs behoves us to consider the evaluation of non-traditional anti-tuberculosis drugs.Clarithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, is defined as a group 5 anti-tuberculosis drug by the World Health Organization; however, its role or efficacy in the treatment of MDR-TB is unclear. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to summarise the evidence for the activity of macrolides against MDR-TB, by evaluating in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies. PubMed and Embase were searched for English language articles up to May 2014.Even though high minimum inhibitory concentration values are usually found, suggesting low activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the potential benefits of macrolides are their accumulation in the relevant compartments and cells in the lungs, their immunomodulatory effects and their synergistic activity with other anti-TB drugs.A future perspective may be use of more potent macrolide analogues to enhance the activity of the treatment regimen.",eng,The European respiratory journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, there is limited awareness, uptake, and use of knowledge to inform action to improve the health of disadvantaged populations. The gap between knowledge and action to improve health equity is of concern to health researchers and practitioners. This study identifies and critically examines the usefulness of existing knowledge to action models or frameworks for promoting health equity.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a scoping review of existing literature to identify knowledge to action (KTA) models or frameworks and critiqued the models using a health equity support rubric.--NEW SECTION--We identified forty-eight knowledge to action models or frameworks. Six models scored between eight and ten of a maximum 12 points on the health equity support rubric. These high scoring models or frameworks all mentioned equity-related concepts. Attention to multisectoral approaches was the factor most often lacking in the low scoring models. The concepts of knowledge brokering, integrative processes, such as those in some indigenous health research, and Ecohealth applied to KTA all emerged as promising areas.--NEW SECTION--Existing knowledge to action models or frameworks can help guide knowledge translation to support action on the social determinants of health and health equity. There is a need to further test existing models or frameworks. This process should be informed by participatory and integrative research. There is room to develop more robust equity supporting models.",eng,International journal for equity in health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26019375,10.1267/ahc.14065,SCGB3A2 Inhibits Acrolein-Induced Apoptosis through Decreased p53 Phosphorylation.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a major global health problem with increasing morbidity and mortality rates, is anticipated to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020. COPD arises from exposure to cigarette smoke. Acrolein, which is contained in cigarette smoke, is the most important risk factor for COPD. It causes lung injury through altering apoptosis and causes inflammation by augmenting p53 phosphorylation and producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2, a secretory protein predominantly present in the epithelial cells of the lungs and trachea, is a cytokine-like small molecule having anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and growth factor activities. In this study, the effect of SCGB3A2 on acrolein-related apoptosis was investigated using the mouse fibroblast cell line MLg as the first step in determining the possible therapeutic value of SCGB3A2 in COPD. Acrolein increased the production of ROS and phosphorylation of p53 and induced apoptosis in MLg cells. While the extent of ROS production induced by acrolein was not affected by SCGB3A2, p53 phosphorylation was significantly decreased by SCGB3A2. These results demonstrate that SCGB3A2 inhibited acrolein-induced apoptosis through decreased p53 phosphorylation, not altered ROS levels.",eng,Acta histochemica et cytochemica,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The scope of the study was to identify the reasons for requesting an electrocardiogram (ECG) in primary health care. A cross-sectional study was conducted in an urban region in Portugal, establishing the motives to ask for an ECG consecutively over two years, starting on 01/03/2007 using data retrieved from structured forms filled out by the physician at the moment of requesting the exam. A total of 870 ECGs of 817 patients were included. Symptoms manifested during the patient visit justified 48.5% of the ECGs, and follow-up of cardiovascular risk factors motivated 25.2%. A global health examination accounted for 22.8% of the requests. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of symptoms (p < 0.001), presence of any cardiovascular risk factor (p = 0.002), hypertension (p < 0.001), diabetes (p = 0.002), and urgency (p < 0.001) were the main factors associated with the requests.

Antimicrobial use is a major driver of resistance, especially in the hospital sector. Understanding the extent and type of antimicrobial use in Canadian hospitals will aid in developing national antimicrobial stewardship priorities.--NEW SECTION--In 2002 and 2009, as part of one-day prevalence surveys to quantify hospital-acquired infections in Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program hospitals, data were collected on the use of systemic antimicrobial agents in all patients in participating hospitals. Specific agents in use (other than antiviral and antiparasitic agents) on the survey day and patient demographic information were collected.--NEW SECTION--In 2002, 2460 of 6747 patients (36.5%) in 28 hospitals were receiving antimicrobial therapy. In 2009, 3989 of 9953 (40.1%) patients in 44 hospitals were receiving antimicrobial therapy (P<0.001). Significantly increased use was observed in central Canada (37.4% to 40.8%) and western Canada (36.9% to 41.1%) but not in eastern Canada (32.9% to 34.1%). In 2009, antimicrobial use was most common on solid organ transplant units (71.0% of patients), intensive care units (68.3%) and hematology/oncology units (65.9%). Compared with 2002, there was a significant decrease in use of first-and second-generation cephalosporins, and significant increases in use of carbapenems, antifungal agents and vancomycin in 2009.

Traditional systems of monitoring and evaluation, however, fail to capture downstream, indirect, or collateral advantages (and threats) of intervention selection, design, and implementation from broader donor perspectives, including those of the diplomatic and foreign policy communities, which these programs also generate. This paper describes the development a new métier under which assessment systems designed to consider the diplomatic value of global health initiatives are described and applied based on previously-identified ""Top Ten"" criteria.--NEW SECTION--The ""Kevany Riposte"" and the ""K-Score"" were conceptualized based on a retrospective and collective assessment of the author's participation in the design, implementation and delivery of a range of global health interventions related to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Responses and associated scores reframe intervention worth or value in terms of global health diplomacy criteria such as ""adaptability"", ""interdependence"", ""training,"" and ""neutrality"". Response options ranged from ""highly advantageous"" to ""significant potential threat"".--NEW SECTION--Global health initiatives under review were found to generate significant advantages from the diplomatic perspective. These included (1) intervention visibility and associations with donor altruism and prestige, (2) development of international non-health collaborations and partnerships, (3) adaptability and responsiveness of service delivery to local needs, and (4) advancement of broader strategic goals of the international community. Corresponding threats included (1) an absence of formal training of project staff on broader political and international relations roles and responsibilities, (2) challenges to recipient cultural and religious practices, (3) intervention-related environmental concerns, and (4) a lack of prima facie consideration of intervention diplomatic and foreign policy consequences.--NEW SECTION--Global health interventions stand to generate significant diplomatic advantages for donor and recipient countries and organizations when appropriately selected, designed, targeted, and delivered. Conversely, in the absence of the application of standards such as those developed under the Kevany Riposte, threats to diplomacy and international relations may occur. With the application of related systems to other global health programmes and settings, comparative results on the relative worth of alternate approaches from the diplomatic perspective may be generated to better inform political, strategic, and global health policy and programmatic decisions.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Frailty is the decline in an individual's homeostatic function, strength and physiologic reserves leading to increased vulnerability, while sarcopenia describes the loss of muscle mass and function with age. The conceptual definitions of these conditions have been widely agreed but there is a lack of consensus on how to measure them. We review the different operational definitions described in the literature and the evidence that, whatever definition used, the prevalence and clinical impact of these conditions is high. We also consider the commonality of low physical function to both conditions, a feature which could provide a pragmatic way forward in terms of identifying those at risk. Objective measures of physical function such as usual walking speed are simple and feasible measures, extensively validated against health outcomes. Additionally, clinical applications of sarcopenia and frailty are reviewed with particular consideration to their potential role in the management of older people undergoing surgery. Frailty appears to outperform traditional anaesthetic and surgical risk scores in terms of its association with post-operative complications, length of hospital stay, institutionalisation and mortality. However, even within this sub-specialty area there is wide variation in the approaches used to measure frailty and there is an urgent need for studies to utilise established, validated and reproducible methods to identify sarcopenia and frailty in their study participants, in order to expedite scientific development.",eng,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
26004292,10.3402/gha.v8.27168,"What do community health workers have to say about their work, and how can this inform improved programme design? A case study with CHWs within Kenya.","Community health workers (CHWs) are used increasingly in the world to address shortages of health workers and the lack of a pervasive national health system. However, while their role is often described at a policy level, it is not clear how these ideals are instantiated in practice, how best to support this work, or how the work is interpreted by local actors. CHWs are often spoken about or spoken for, but there is little evidence of CHWs' own characterisation of their practice, which raises questions for global health advocates regarding power and participation in CHW programmes. This paper addresses this issue.--NEW SECTION--A case study approach was undertaken in a series of four steps. Firstly, groups of CHWs from two communities met and reported what their daily work consisted of. Secondly, individual CHWs were interviewed so that they could provide fuller, more detailed accounts of their work and experiences; in addition, community health extension workers and community health committee members were interviewed, to provide alternative perspectives. Thirdly, notes and observations were taken in community meetings and monthly meetings. The data were then analysed thematically, creating an account of how CHWs describe their own work, and the tensions and challenges that they face.--NEW SECTION--The thematic analysis of the interview data explored the structure of CHW's work, in terms of the frequency and range of visits, activities undertaken during visits (monitoring, referral, etc.) and the wider context of their work (links to the community and health service, limited training, coordination and mutual support through action and discussion days, etc.), and provided an opportunity for CHWs to explain their motivations, concerns and how they understood their role. The importance of these findings as a contribution to the field is evidenced by the depth and detail of their descriptive power. One important aspect of this is that CHWs' accounts of both successes and challenges involved material elements: leaky tins and dishracks evidenced successful health interventions, whilst bicycles, empty first aid kits and recruiting stretcher bearers evidenced the difficulties of resourcing and geography they are required to overcome.--NEW SECTION--The way that these CHWs described their work was as healthcare generalists, working to serve their community and to integrate it with the official health system. Their work involves referrals, monitoring, reporting and educational interactions. Whilst they face problems with resources and training, their accounts show that they respond to this in creative ways, working within established systems of community power and formal authority to achieve their goals, rather than falling into a 'deficit' position that requires remedial external intervention. Their work is widely appreciated, although some households do resist their interventions, and figures of authority sometimes question their manner and expertise. The material challenges that they face have both practical and community aspects, since coping with scarcity brings community members together. The implication of this is that programmes co-designed with CHWs will be easier to implement because of their relevance to their practices and experiences, whereas those that assume a deficit model or seek to use CHWs as an instrument to implement external priorities are likely to disrupt their work.",eng,Global health action,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Mortality rates decreased by 1.5% per year from 2001 through 2010 for most types of cancer in men and women. However, oral cancer is still a significant global health problem since incidence and mortality rates are increasing. Oral cavity cancer is ranked the 8th in men and the 14th in women based on data collected between 2006 and 2010 by the National Institute of Health. Furthermore, an increasing incidence of head and neck neoplasms, particularly the tongue cancer among young adults has been reported recently. It is most likely due to increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or the early start of tobacco and alcohol consumption. Treatment of oral cancer patients is mainly surgical and often leads to esthetic and functional deformities, with severe impact on the quality of life. Thus, novel form of treatments and selection of patients with high and low risk of mortality is of high priority for clinical studies. The expression of proteolytic enzymes in tumor and stromal tissues has been shown to have prognostic significance in many human cancers and inhibiting proteolysis can reduce tumor growth in many in vivo and in vitro models. Plasmin, with its activators and inhibitors are of great importance in many human malignances and collectively are called plasminogen activation system (PAS). In this comprehensive review we examine expression, possible prognostic markers and importance for therapy of the PAS members in oral cancer. Literature review suggests that overexpression of urokinase and its receptor are markers of poor outcome, thus, their inhibition can be explored in oral cancer therapy. Role of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) is complex and depends on its concentration. Overexpression of PAI-1 favors angiogenesis, metastasis and poor prognosis, although when applied in very high concentrations it inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth, the phenomenon is described as the PAI-1 paradox.",eng,International journal of oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Given this, we performed cross-national comparisons with the aim of investigating: 1) the associations of political factors with patients' reports of health system responsiveness and 2) the extent to which health input and output might explain these associations. World Health Survey data were analyzed for 44 countries (n = 103 541). Main outcomes included, respectively, 8 and 7 responsiveness domains for inpatient and outpatient care. Linear multilevel regressions were used to assess the associations of politics (namely, civil liberties and political rights), socioeconomic development, health system input, and health system output (measured by maternal mortality) with responsiveness domains, adjusted for demographic factors. Political rights showed positive associations with dignity (regression coefficient = 0.086 [standard error = 0.039]), quality (0.092 [0.049]), and support (0.113 [0.048]) for inpatient care and with dignity (0.075 [0.040]), confidentiality (0.089 [0.043]), and quality (0.124 [0.053]) for outpatient care. Positive associations were observed for civil liberties as well. Health system input and output reduced observed associations. Results tentatively suggest that strengthening political rights and, to a certain extent, civil liberties might improve health system responsiveness, in part through their effect on health system input and output.",eng,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

After hand-searching, 37 articles were included: 18 articles with fetal outcome data and 19 case reports of fetal vaccinia. Outcomes of smallpox vaccination in 12,201 pregnant women were included. Smallpox vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (pooled relative risk [RR] 1.03, confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.41), stillbirth (pooled RR 1.03, CI 0.75-1.40), or preterm birth (pooled RR 0.84, CI 0.62-1.15). When vaccination in any trimester was considered, smallpox vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of congenital defects (pooled RR 1.25, CI 0.99-1.56); however, first-trimester exposure was associated with an increased risk of congenital defects (2.4% compared with 1.5%, pooled RR 1.34, CI 1.02-1.77). No cases of fetal vaccinia were reported in the studies examining fetal outcomes; 21 cases of fetal vaccinia were identified in the literature, of which three neonates survived.--NEW SECTION--The overall risk associated with maternal smallpox vaccination appears low. No association between smallpox vaccination and spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, or stillbirth was identified. First-trimester vaccination was associated with a small increase in congenital defects, but the effect size was small and based on limited data. Fetal vaccinia appears to be a rare consequence of maternal smallpox vaccination but is associated with a high rate of fetal loss.",eng,Obstetrics and gynecology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Here, we investigate in vitro the Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cytokines and transcriptional factors produced after Mycobacterium-specific antigen stimulation in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, clinically cured pulmonary tuberculosis, and healthy donors with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST+). Together, our data indicate that clinical cure after treatment increases the percentages of Mycobacterium-specific Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells compared with those found in active-TB and TST+ healthy donors. These results show that the host-parasite equilibrium in latent TB breaks in favor of the microorganism and that the subsequent clinical recovery posttreatment does not return the percentage levels of such cells to those observed in latent tuberculosis. Additionally, our results indicate that rather than showing an increase in the percentage of Mycobacterium-specific Tregs, active-TB patients display lower Th1 : Treg and Th17 : Treg ratios. These data, together with lower Th1 : Th2 and Th17 : Th2 ratios, may indicate a mechanism by which the breakdown of the host-parasite equilibrium leads to active-TB and changes in the repertoire of Mycobacterium-specific Th cells that are associated with clinical cure after treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.",eng,BioMed research international,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25999047,10.1002/hep.27913,Interferon-inducible cholesterol-25-hydroxylase restricts hepatitis C virus replication through blockage of membranous web formation.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that primarily infects human hepatocytes. Infections with HCV constitute a global health problem, with 180 million people currently chronically infected. Recent studies have reported that cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is expressed as an interferon-stimulated gene and mediates antiviral activities against different enveloped viruses through the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). However, the intrinsic regulation of human CH25H (hCH25H) expression within the liver as well as its mechanistic effects on HCV infectivity remain elusive. In this study, we characterized the expression of hCH25H using liver biopsies and primary human hepatocytes. In addition, the antiviral properties of this protein and its enzymatic product, 25HC, were further characterized against HCV in tissue culture. Levels of hCH25H messenger RNA were significantly up-regulated both in HCV-positive liver biopsies and in HCV-infected primary human hepatocytes. The expression of hCH25H in primary human hepatocytes was primarily and transiently induced by type I interferon. Transient expression of hCH25H in human hepatoma cells restricted HCV infection in a genotype-independent manner. This inhibition required the enzymatic activity of CH25H. We observed an inhibition of viral membrane fusion during the entry process by 25HC, which was not due to a virucidal effect. Yet the primary effect by 25HC on HCV was at the level of RNA replication, which was observed using subgenomic replicons of two different genotypes. Further analysis using electron microscopy revealed that 25HC inhibited formation of the membranous web, the HCV replication factory, independent of RNA replication.--NEW SECTION--Infection with HCV causes up-regulation of interferon-inducible CH25H in vivo, and its product, 25HC, restricts HCV primarily at the level of RNA replication by preventing formation of the viral replication factory.",eng,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Diabetes and obesity are intrinsically linked: obesity increases the risk of diabetes and also contributes to disease progression and cardiovascular disease. Although the benefits of weight loss in the prevention of diabetes and as a critical component of managing the condition are well established, weight reduction remains challenging for individuals with type 2 diabetes due to a host of metabolic and psychological factors. For many patients, lifestyle intervention is not enough to achieve weight loss, and alternative options, such as pharmacotherapy, need to be considered. However, many traditional glucose-lowering medications may lead to weight gain. This article focuses on the potential of currently available pharmacological strategies and on emerging approaches in development to support the glycemic and weight-loss goals of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Two pharmacotherapy types are considered: those developed primarily for blood glucose control that have a favorable effect on body weight and those developed primarily to induce weight loss that have a favorable effect on blood glucose control. Finally, the potential of combination therapies for the management of obese patients with type 2 diabetes is discussed.",eng,Diabetes care,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25996946,10.1371/journal.pntd.0003703,The Contributions of Onchocerciasis Control and Elimination Programs toward the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.,"In 2000, 189 member states of the United Nations (UN) developed a plan for peace and development, which resulted in eight actionable goals known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Since their inception, the MDGs have been considered the international standard for measuring development progress and have provided a blueprint for global health policy and programming. However, emphasis upon the achievement of priority benchmarks around the ""big three"" diseases--namely HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria--has influenced global health entities to disproportionately allocate resources. Meanwhile, several tropical diseases that almost exclusively impact the poorest of the poor continue to be neglected, despite the existence of cost-effective and feasible methods of control or elimination. One such Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD), onchocerciasis, more commonly known as river blindness, is a debilitating and stigmatizing disease primarily affecting individuals living in remote and impoverished areas. Onchocerciasis control is considered to be one of the most successful and cost-effective public health campaigns ever launched. In addition to improving the health and well-being of millions of individuals, these programs also lead to improvements in education, agricultural production, and economic development in affected communities. Perhaps most pertinent to the global health community, though, is the demonstrated effectiveness of facilitating community engagement by allowing communities considerable ownership with regard to drug delivery. This paper reviews the contributions that such concentrated efforts to control and eliminate onchocerciasis make to achieving select MDGs. The authors hope to draw the attention of public policymakers and global health funders to the importance of the struggle against onchocerciasis as a model for community-directed interventions to advance health and development, and to advocate for NTDs inclusion in the post 2015 agenda.",eng,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This paper uses a unique opportunity for comparison between a knowledge, practice, and coverage (KPC) household survey and Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (RDHS) carried out in overlapping timeframes to disprove these enduring suspicions. Our analysis shows that the KPC provides coverage estimates consistent with the RDHS estimates for the same geographic areas. We discuss cases of divergence between estimates. Application of the Lives Saved Tool to the KPC results also yields child mortality estimates comparable with DHS-measured mortality. We draw three main lessons from the study and conclude with recommendations for challenging unfounded assumptions against the value of small household coverage surveys, which can be a key resource in the arsenal of local health programmers.",eng,"Journal of health, population, and nutrition",Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

Here, we adapted the JFH1-based Core-NS2 recombinant SA13/JFH1C3405G,A3696G (termed SA13/JFH1orig), of the poorly characterized genotype 5a, to Huh7.5 cells, yielding a virus with greatly improved spread kinetics and an infectivity titer of 6.7 log10 focus-forming units (FFU)/ml. We identified several putative adaptive amino acid changes. In head-to-head infections at fixed multiplicities of infection, one SA13/JFH1orig mutant termed SA13/JFH1Core-NS5B, containing 13 amino acid changes (R114W and V187A [Core]; V235L [E1]; T385P [E2]; L782V [p7]; Y900C [NS2]; N2034D, E2238G, V2252A, L2266P, and I2340T [NS5A]; A2500S and V2841A [NS5B]), displayed fitness comparable to that of the polyclonal high-titer adapted virus. Single-cycle virus production assays in CD81-deficient Huh7-derived cells demonstrated that these changes did not affect replication but increased HCV assembly and specific infectivity as early as 24 h posttransfection. Infectious coculture assays in Huh7.5 cells showed a significant increase in cell-to-cell transmission for SA13/JFH1Core-NS5B viruses as well as viruses with only p7 and nonstructural protein mutations. Interestingly, the E2 hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) mutation T385P caused (i) increased sensitivity to neutralizing patient IgG and human monoclonal antibodies AR3A and AR4A and (ii) increased accessibility of the CD81 binding site without affecting the usage of CD81 and SR-BI. We finally demonstrated that SA13/JFH1orig and SA13/JFH1Core-NS5B, with and without the E2 mutation T385P, displayed similar biophysical properties following iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation. This study has implications for investigations requiring high virus concentrations, such as studies of HCV particle composition and development of whole-virus vaccine antigens.--NEW SECTION--Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global health care burden, affecting more than 150 million people worldwide. These individuals are at high risk of developing severe end-stage liver diseases. No vaccine exists. While it is possible to produce HCV particles resembling isolates of all HCV genotypes in human hepatoma cells (HCVcc), production efficacy varies. Thus, for several important studies, including vaccine development, in vitro systems enabling high-titer production of diverse HCV strains would be advantageous. Our study offers important functional data on how cell culture-adaptive mutations identified in genotype 5a JFH1-based HCVcc permit high-titer culture by affecting HCV genesis through increasing virus assembly and HCV fitness by enhancing the virus specific infectivity and cell-to-cell transmission ability, without influencing the biophysical particle properties. High-titer HCVcc like the one described in this study may be pivotal in future vaccine-related studies where large quantities of infectious HCV particles are necessary.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Apart from other factors the trans-differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into adipocytes is an added detrimental factor causing the intensification of obesity. The main objective of this present study is to analyse whether capsaicin is capable of inhibiting the differentiation of BMSCs to adipocytes. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were obtained and exposed to different concentrations of capsaicin for a period of 6 days following 2 days of adipogenic induction. The capsaicin exposed cells were collected at three different time points (2, 4 and 6 days) and subjected to various analyses. BMSCs after exposure to capsaicin showed dose and time dependent reduction in cell viability and proliferation. Interestingly, capsaicin induced cell cycle arrest at G0-G1 and increased apoptosis by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production. Capsaicin significantly inhibited the early adipogenic differentiation, lipogenesis and maturation of adipocytes with concomitant repression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, FABP4 and SCD-1. Taken together, the results of the present study have clearly emphasized that capsaicin potentially inhibits the adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells via many different pathways (anti-proliferative, apoptotic and cell cycle arrest) through the stimulation of ROS and RNS production. Thus, capsaicin not only suppresses the maturation of pre-adipocytes into adipocytes but also inhibits the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes.",eng,Food & function,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In this study we explored the relationship of potential ageing/frailty biomarkers with age and clinical frailty.

We also developed a new tool to summarize clinical frailty, designated Leuven Oncogeriatric Frailty Score (LOFS), by integrating GA results in a single, semi-continuous score. LOFS' median score was 8, on a scale from 0=frail to 10=fit. IL-6 levels were associated with chronological age in both groups and with clinical frailty in older breast cancer patients, whereas telomere length, IGF-1 and MCP-1 only correlated with age. Plasma IL-6 should be further explored as frailty biomarker in cancer patients.",eng,Aging,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25988255,NA,Congenital rubella syndrome: a matter of concern.,"Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), an important cause of severe birth defects, remains a public health problem in a significant number of countries. Therefore, global health experts encourage use of rubella vaccination, with the primary aim of preventing CRS. While large-scale rubella vaccination during the last decade has drastically reduced or eliminated both the virus and CRS in Europe and the Americas, many countries in Africa, South-East Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Western Pacific have not yet incorporated any type of rubella-containing vaccine into their immunization schedule. As a result, through travel and migration, rubella has been imported into countries that had successfully eliminated the virus, leading to outbreaks and the reestablishment of endemic transmission. The objective of this study was to identify the key factors required for CRS elimination (prevalence reduction, vaccination strategies, and surveillance methods) by reviewing publications in PubMed on rubella and CRS (systematic reviews, country experiences, and position papers from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other intergovernmental organizations). Based on the results of the review, to eliminate rubella and CRS in endemic areas and reduce re-emergence in previously disease-free areas, all countries should carry out two types of mass rubella vaccination campaigns: 1) one single mass national immunization campaign targeting all men and women 5-39+ years old (with the upper age limit depending on the year in which the rubella-containing vaccine was introduced and the epidemiology of rubella in the country) and 2) incorporation of an rubella-containing vaccine in routine childhood immunization programs, including regular vaccination campaigns for 12-month-olds and measles follow-up campaigns. In addition to mass rubella immunization campaigns and routine childhood vaccination programs, the following measures should be taken to help fight rubella and CRS: 1) surveillance of the number of susceptible women of childbearing age, and the emergence of imported cases; 2) coverage of susceptible populations with ""second-chance"" (""catch-up"") campaigns (vaccination of older children and adults who may have missed earlier immunization programs); 3) rapid response to outbreaks; 4) strengthening of CRS surveillance; 5) involvement of the private sector in awareness and vaccination campaigns; and 6) reduction of the number of false-positive laboratory test results.",eng,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, compared with IMRT, the benefits of ENPG have not yet been clearly described.--NEW SECTION--We defined a resectable area in which the disease could be radically removed using ENPG and our imaging specialists selected eligible patients with tumors confined to this resectable area from a database of rNPC patients. Using propensity scores to adjust for some potential prognostic factors, a well-balanced cohort of 144 limited rNPC patients was created by matching each patient who underwent ENPG (study group) with one who underwent IMRT (control group). Morbidity, long-term oncological results, treatment-related complications, medical costs, and quality of life were compared.--NEW SECTION--Compared with IMRT, ENPG was associated with a relatively good overall survival (5-year OS, 77.1% vs 55.5%, P=.003), QOL conservation (mean global health status score, 57.6 vs 29.8, P<.001), and significant decreases in post-treatment complications (12.5% vs 65.3%, P<.001), medical costs (23 645.90 vs 118 122.53 Yuan, P<.001)≈(€2371.71 vs 11,847.80, P<.001).--NEW SECTION--Salvage ENPG may be more effective for maximizing survival and QOL benefits and minimizing treatment-related complications and medical costs for limited rNPC patients, as compared with IMRT.",eng,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Out of this human calamity has come renewed attention to global health security--its definition, meaning, and the practical implications for programmes and policy. For example, how does a government begin to strengthen its core public health capacities, as demanded by the International Health Regulations? What counts as a global health security concern? In the context of the governance of global health, including WHO reform, it will be important to distil lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak. The Lancet invited a group of respected global health practitioners to reflect on these lessons, to explore the idea of global health security, and to offer suggestions for next steps. Their contributions describe some of the major threats to individual and collective human health, as well as the values and recommendations that should be considered to counteract such threats in the future.

Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs), which include oncocins, are an extensively studied class of AMPs that counteract bacterial infection at submicromolar concentrations. Oncocins enter and kill bacteria by inhibiting certain targets rather than by acting through membrane lysis. Although they have recently been reported to bind DnaK and the bacterial ribosome, their mode of inhibition has remained elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of the oncocin derivative Onc112 bound to the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome. Strikingly, this 19-residue proline-rich peptide manifests the features of several known classes of ribosome inhibitors by simultaneously blocking the peptidyl transferase center and the peptide-exit tunnel of the ribosome. This high-resolution structure thus reveals the mechanism by which oncocins inhibit protein synthesis, providing an opportunity for structure-based design of new-generation therapeutics.",eng,Nature structural & molecular biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

HCV infection remains as an independent risk factor for chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and a major reason for liver transplantation. Discovery of direct acting antiviral (DAA) drugs have shown promising results with more than 90% success rate in clearing the HCV RNA in patients, although long-term consequences remain to be evaluated. microRNAs (miRNAs) are important players in establishment of HCV infection and target crucial host cellular factors needed for productive HCV replication and augmented cell growth. Altered expression of miRNAs is involved in the pathogenesis associated with HCV infection by controlling signaling pathways such as immune response, proliferation and apoptosis. miRNA is emerging as a means of communication between various cell types inside the liver. There is likely possibility of developing circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of disease progression and can also serve as diagnostic tool with potential of early therapeutic intervention in HCV associated end stage liver disease.

Targeting neglected cognitive aspects may provide a useful route. We tested a cognitive-training paradigm using positive mental imagery (imagery cognitive bias modification, imagery CBM), developed via experimental psychopathology studies, in a randomized controlled trial. Training was delivered via the Internet to 150 individuals with current major depression. Unexpectedly, there was no significant advantage for imagery CBM compared with a closely matched control for depression symptoms as a whole in the full sample. In exploratory analyses, compared with the control, imagery CBM significantly improved anhedonia over the intervention and improved depression symptoms as a whole for those participants with fewer than five episodes of depression and those who engaged to a threshold level of imagery. Results suggest avenues for improving imagery CBM to inform low-intensity treatment tools for depression.

Our objective was to explore the association between wind turbine noise, sleep disturbance and quality of life, using data from published observational studies. We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health and Google Scholar databases. No language restrictions were imposed. Hand searches of bibliography of retrieved full texts were also conducted. The reporting quality of included studies was assessed using the STROBE guidelines. Two reviewers independently determined the eligibility of studies, assessed the quality of included studies, and extracted the data. We included eight studies with a total of 2433 participants. All studies were cross-sectional, and the overall reporting quality was moderate. Meta-analysis of six studies (n=2364) revealed that the odds of being annoyed is significantly increased by wind turbine noise (OR: 4.08; 95% CI: 2.37 to 7.04; p<0.00001). The odds of sleep disturbance was also significantly increased with greater exposure to wind turbine noise (OR: 2.94; 95% CI: 1.98 to 4.37; p<0.00001). Four studies reported that wind turbine noise significantly interfered with QOL. Further, visual perception of wind turbine generators was associated with greater frequency of reported negative health effects. In conclusion, there is some evidence that exposure to wind turbine noise is associated with increased odds of annoyance and sleep problems. Individual attitudes could influence the type of response to noise from wind turbines. Experimental and observational studies investigating the relationship between wind turbine noise and health are warranted.",eng,Environment international,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Therefore, development of new classes of antimalarial agents is essential to effectively treat malaria. In this study, the efficacy of naturally occurring diterpenoids, dehydroabietylamine and abietic acid, and their synthetic derivatives was assessed for antimalarial activity. Dehydroabietylamine and its N-trifluoroacetyl, N-tribromoacetyl, N-benzoyl, and N-benzyl derivatives showed excellent activity against P. falciparum parasites with IC50 values of 0.36 to 2.6 µM. Interestingly, N-dehydroabietylbenzamide showed potent antimalarial activity (IC50 0.36), and negligible cytotoxicity (IC50 >100 µM) to mammalian cells; thus, this compound can be an important antimalarial drug. In contrast, abietic acid was only marginally effective, exhibiting an IC50 value of ~82 µM. Several carboxylic group-derivatives of abietic acid were moderately active with IC50 values of ~8.2 to ~13.3 µM. These results suggest that a detailed understanding of the structure-activity relationship of abietane diterpenoids might provide strategies to exploit this class of compounds for malaria treatment.",eng,Experimental parasitology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

It draws attention to forms of calculated practices which Foucault notes as technologies of power that aim to foster positive demographic and economic trends in societies through the apparatus of security. These practices are employed at the global level with similar ambitions; hence, we adopt the term global governmentality. We discuss the applications of global governmentality by actors in the global core through the apparatus of security and (neo)liberal economic practices. We then provide examples of resistance/contestation from actors mainly in the global periphery through discussions of viral sovereignty; access to essential medicines, including HIV drugs; and health for all as a human right.

Previous work from our lab has established the murine multidrug resistance-2 mouse (MDR2) model of HCC as a reasonable preclinical model that parallels the changes seen in human inflammatory associated HCC. The purpose of this study is to evaluate modalities of PET/CT in MDR2(-/-) mice in order to facilitate therapeutic translational studies from bench to bedside.--NEW SECTION--18F-FDG and 11C-acetate PET/CT was performed on 12 m MDR2(-/-) mice (n = 3/tracer) with HCC and 12 m MDR2(-/+) control mice (n = 3/tracer) without HCC. To compare PET/CT to biological markers of HCC and cellular function, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), cAMP and hepatic tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were quantified in 3-12 m MDR2(-/-) (n = 10) mice using commercially available ELISA analysis. To translate results in mice to patients 11C-acetate PET/CT was also performed in 8 patents suspected of HCC recurrence following treatment and currently on the liver transplant wait list.--NEW SECTION--Hepatic18F-FDG metabolism was not significantly increased in MDR2(-/-) mice. In contrast, hepatic 11C-acetate metabolism was significantly elevated in MDR2(-/-) mice when compared to MDR2(-/+) controls. Serum AFP and LPA levels increased in MDR2(-/-) mice contemporaneous with the emergence of HCC. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in serum cAMP levels and an increase in hepatic TNFα. In patients suspected of HCC recurrence there were 5 true positives, 2 true negatives and 1 suspected false 11C-acetate negative.--NEW SECTION--Hepatic 11C-acetate PET/CT tracks well with HCC in MDR2(-/-) mice and patients with underlying liver disease. Consequently 11C-acetate PET/CT is well suited to study (1) HCC emergence/progression in patients and (2) reduce animal numbers required to study new chemotherapeutics in murine models of HCC.",eng,BMC medical imaging,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

We identify initiatives aimed at promoting the use of big data in European Union (EU) health care, highlight expected challenges, and use these to evaluate EU big data policy developments to the extent that they are able to advance health sector priorities. A comprehensive approach is used to capture and examine peer-reviewed and gray literature publications on the use of big data in global health systems. This approach involved electronic database and specialist website searching, as well as complementary use of search engines and qualitative inputs from key EU policy stakeholders. Ongoing health data initiatives revolve around data center development, confidentiality and security, e-health and m-health, and genomics and bioinformatics. The literature acknowledges several main challenges to the successful integration of big data in health care, classified as either ethical (confidentiality and data security, access to information) or technical (data reliability, interoperability, data management and governance). EU data policy has started to address these issues, though additional work remains. A larger outstanding challenge is the lack of a comprehensive health and research policy strategy for big data that targets sectoral objectives.

We linked national hospital service utilization with national epidemiologic data to describe the use of surgical procedures in the management of a broad spectrum of conditions.--NEW SECTION--We compiled International Classification of Diseases-10-Australian Modification codes from the New Zealand National Minimum Dataset, 2008-2011. Using primary cause of admission, we aggregated hospitalizations into 119 disease states and 22 disease subcategories of the World Health Organization Global Health Estimate (GHE). We queried each hospitalization for any surgical procedure in a binary manner to determine the volume of surgery for each disease state. Surgical procedures were defined as requiring general or neuroaxial anesthesia. We then divided the volume of surgical cases by counts of disease prevalence from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 to determine annual surgical incidence.--NEW SECTION--Between 2008 and 2011, there were 1,108,653 hospital admissions with 275,570 associated surgical procedures per year. Surgical procedures were associated with admissions for all 22 GHE disease subcategories and 116 of 119 GHE disease states.

25978092,10.1089/omi.2015.0030,DBDiaSNP: An Open-Source Knowledgebase of Genetic Polymorphisms and Resistance Genes Related to Diarrheal Pathogens.,"Diarrhea is a highly common infection among children, responsible for significant morbidity and mortality rate worldwide. After pneumonia, diarrhea remains the second leading cause of neonatal deaths. Numerous viral, bacterial, and parasitic enteric pathogens are associated with diarrhea. With increasing antibiotic resistance among enteric pathogens, there is an urgent need for global surveillance of the mutations and resistance genes primarily responsible for resistance to antibiotic treatment. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms are important in this regard as they have a vast potential to be utilized as molecular diagnostics for gene-disease or pharmacogenomics association studies linking genotype to phenotype. DBDiaSNP is a comprehensive repository of mutations and resistance genes among various diarrheal pathogens and hosts to advance breakthroughs that will find applications from development of sequence-based diagnostic tools to drug discovery. It contains information about 946 mutations and 326 resistance genes compiled from literature and various web resources. As of March 2015, it houses various pathogen genes and the mutations responsible for antibiotic resistance. The pathogens include, for example, DEC (Diarrheagenic E.coli), Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Shigella spp., Clostridium difficile, Aeromonas spp., Helicobacter pylori, Entamoeba histolytica, Vibrio cholera, and viruses. It also includes mutations from hosts (e.g., humans, pigs, others) that render them either susceptible or resistant to a certain type of diarrhea. DBDiaSNP is therefore intended as an integrated open access database for researchers and clinicians working on diarrheal diseases. Additionally, we note that the DBDiaSNP is one of the first antibiotic resistance databases for the diarrheal pathogens covering mutations and resistance genes that have clinical relevance from a broad range of pathogens and hosts.

25976481,10.1080/10962247.2015.1040526,Air quality and climate connections.,"Multiple linkages connect air quality and climate change. Many air pollutant sources also emit carbon dioxide (CO2), the dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG). The two main contributors to non-attainment of U.S. ambient air quality standards, ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM), interact with radiation, forcing climate change. PM warms by absorbing sunlight (e.g., black carbon) or cools by scattering sunlight (e.g., sulfates) and interacts with clouds; these radiative and microphysical interactions can induce changes in precipitation and regional circulation patterns. Climate change is expected to degrade air quality in many polluted regions by changing air pollution meteorology (ventilation and dilution), precipitation and other removal processes, and by triggering some amplifying responses in atmospheric chemistry and in anthropogenic and natural sources. Together, these processes shape distributions and extreme episodes of O3 and PM. Global modeling indicates that as air pollution programs reduce SO2 to meet health and other air quality goals, near-term warming accelerates due to ""unmasking"" of warming induced by rising CO2. Air pollutant controls on CH4, a potent GHG and precursor to global O3 levels, and on sources with high black carbon (BC) to organic carbon (OC) ratios could offset near-term warming induced by SO2 emission reductions, while reducing global background O3 and regionally high levels of PM. Lowering peak warming requires decreasing atmospheric CO2, which for some source categories would also reduce co-emitted air pollutants or their precursors. Model projections for alternative climate and air quality scenarios indicate a wide range for U.S. surface O3 and fine PM, although regional projections may be confounded by interannual to decadal natural climate variability. Continued implementation of U.S. NOx emission controls guards against rising pollution levels triggered either by climate change or by global emission growth. Improved accuracy and trends in emission inventories are critical for accountability analyses of historical and projected air pollution and climate mitigation policies.--NEW SECTION--The expansion of U.S. air pollution policy to protect climate provides an opportunity for joint mitigation, with CH4 a prime target. BC reductions in developing nations would lower the global health burden, and for BC-rich sources (e.g., diesel) may lessen warming. Controls on these emissions could offset near-term warming induced by health-motivated reductions of sulfate (cooling). Wildfires, dust, and other natural PM and O3 sources may increase with climate warming, posing challenges to implementing and attaining air quality standards. Accountability analyses for recent and projected air pollution and climate control strategies should underpin estimated benefits and trade-offs of future policies.",eng,Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This preliminary study sought to (1) describe body image problems, including sociodemographic and disease/treatment correlates, and (2) examine relations between body image and sexual function.--NEW SECTION--For the baseline assessment of a larger study, 70 women completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire and Colorectal Cancer-specific Module, including the Body Image subscale, and Female Sexual Function Index. Pearson's correlation and multiple regression evaluated correlates of body image. Among sexually active women (n = 41), hierarchical regression examined relations between body image and sexual function domains.--NEW SECTION--Women were on average 55 years old (standard deviation = 11.6), non-Hispanic White (79%), married (57%), and employed (47%). The majority (86%) reported at least one body image problem. Younger age, lower global health status, and greater severity of symptoms related to poorer body image (p's < 0.05). Poor body image was inversely related to all aspects of sexual function (β range 0.50-0.70, p's < 0.05), except pain. The strongest association was with Female Sexual Function Index Sexual/Relationship Satisfaction.--NEW SECTION--These preliminary findings suggest the importance of assessing body image as a potentially modifiable target to address sexual difficulties in this understudied group. Further longitudinal research is needed to inform the development and implementation of effective interventions to improve the sexual health and well-being of female ARCa survivors.",eng,Psycho-oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
25973191,10.1016/j.amsu.2015.04.001,Attitudes towards the surgical safety checklist and factors associated with its use: A global survey of frontline medical professionals.,"The Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC) has been shown to reduce perioperative errors and complications and its implementation is recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). However, it is unknown how widely this intervention is used. We investigated attitudes and factors associated with use of WHO SSC in frontline medical professionals across the globe using a survey distributed through social networks.--NEW SECTION--A survey of usage and opinions regarding the SSC was posted on the Facebook and Twitter pages of a not-for-profit surgical news website for one month (March 2013). Respondents were grouped into four groups based on their country's Gross National Income: high, upper middle, lower middle and low income. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate how different factors were associated with the use of the SSC.--NEW SECTION--6269 medical professionals from 69 countries responded to the survey: most respondents were from lower middle (47.4%) countries, followed by: high (35.0%), upper middle (14.6%), and low (3.0%) income countries. In total, 57.5% reported that they used the WHO SSC perioperatively. Fewer respondents used the WHO SSC in upper middle, lower middle and low income countries (LMICs) compared to high income countries (43.5% vs. 83.5%, p < 0.001). Female (61.3% vs. 56.4% males, p = 0.001), consultant surgeons (59.6% vs. 53.2% interns, p < 0.001) and working in university hospitals (61.4% vs. 53.7% non-university hospitals, p < 0.001) were more likely to use the SSC. Believing the SSC was useful, did not work or caused delays was independently associated with the respondents reported use of the SSC (OR 1.22 95% CI 1.07-1.39; OR 0.47 95% CI 0.36-0.60; OR 0.64 95% CI 0.53-0.77, respectively).--NEW SECTION--This study suggests the use of the WHO SSC is variable across countries, especially in LMICs where it has the most potential to improve patient safety. Critical appraisal of the documented benefits of the WHO SSC may improve its adoption by those not currently using it.",eng,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that antenatal maternal low protein diet (MLPD) leads to sexually dimorphic developmental programming of the components of the pulmonary renin-angiotensin system. This may be important in the antenatal MLPD-associated development of hypertension. In pregnant mice, we administered normal (control) and isocaloric 50% protein restricted diet, commencing one week before mating and continuing until delivery of the pups. From the 18th to 24th week postnatal, we measured blood pressure in the offspring by use of a non-invasive tail-cuff method. In the same mice, we examined the mRNA and protein expression of the key components of the pulmonary renin-angiotensin system. Also, we examined microRNA complementary to angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) 2 in the offspring lungs. Our results demonstrate that as a consequence of antenatal MLPD: 1) pup birthweight was significantly reduced in both sexes. 2) female offspring developed hypertension, but males did not. 3) In female offspring, ACE-2 protein expression was significantly reduced without any change in the mRNA levels. 4) miRNA 429, which has a binding site on ACE-2 - 3' UTR was significantly upregulated in the female antenatal MLPD offspring. 5) In males, ACE-2 mRNA and protein expression were unaltered. We conclude that in the mouse, antenatal MLPD-induced reduction of ACE-2 in the female offspring lung may be an important mechanisms in sexually dimorphic programming of hypertension.",eng,BMC physiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In particular, the challenge represented by the recent emergence of CHIKV in the Americas has strengthened the need of a safe and effective vaccine. Although research on vaccines against CHIKV has been slow, a few vaccine candidates have been tested over the years. Inactivated and attenuated vaccine candidates have shown promising results in phase I/II trials, and engineered vaccines have proven to be safe and immunogenic in mouse and/or non-human primate models. Recently, a vaccine based on virus-like particles (VLP) has been successfully tested in a phase I trial. However, large phase I/II controlled trials, which are needed in order to provide evidence of vaccine efficacy, may be planned only under certain conditions. First, they should be conducted during epidemic periods, when a large number of cases occur, in order to ensure an adequate study power. Second, they are expensive and investments returns are not always guaranteed. To overcome this problem, public/private partnership and government support, the identification of target population groups for vaccination and the commitment of donor agencies are key factors for supporting both the development and the availability of vaccines against neglected tropical diseases like chikungunya.",eng,Pathogens and global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25969732,10.7189/jogh.05.010409,Prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review and analysis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the small joints of the body. It is one of the leading causes of chronic morbidity in high-income countries, but little is known about the burden of this disease in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).--NEW SECTION--The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of RA in six of the World Health Organization's (WHO) regions that harbour LMIC by identifying all relevant studies in those regions. To accomplish this aim various bibliographic databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, Global Health, LILACS and the Chinese databases CNKI and WanFang. Studies were selected based on pre-defined inclusion criteria, including a definition of RA based on the 1987 revision of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) definition.--NEW SECTION--Meta-estimates of regional RA prevalence rates for countries of low or middle income were 0.40% (95% CI: 0.23-0.57%) for Southeast Asian, 0.37% (95% CI: 0.23-0.51%) for Eastern Mediterranean, 0.62% (95% CI: 0.47-0.77%) for European, 1.25% (95% CI: 0.64-1.86%) for American and 0.42% (95% CI: 0.30-0.53%) for Western Pacific regions. A formal meta-analysis could not be performed for the sub-Saharan African region due to limited data. Male prevalence of RA in LMIC was 0.16% (95% CI: 0.11-0.20%) while the prevalence in women reached 0.75% (95% CI: 0.60-0.90%). This difference between males and females was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). The prevalence of RA did not differ significantly between urban and rural settings (P = 0.353). These prevalence estimates represent 2.60 (95% CI: 1.85-3.34%) million male sufferers and 12.21 (95% CI: 9.78-14.67%) million female sufferers in LMIC in the year 2000, and 3.16 (95% CI: 2.25-4.05%) million affected males and 14.87 (95% CI: 11.91-17.86%) million affected females in LMIC in the year 2010.--NEW SECTION--Given that majority of the world's population resides in LMIC, the number of affected people is substantial, with a projection to increase in the coming years. Therefore, policy makers and health-care providers need to plan to address a significant disease burden both socially and economically.",eng,Journal of global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25969731,10.7189/jogh.05.010407,Impact of global health governance on country health systems: the case of HIV initiatives in Nigeria.,"Three global health initiatives (GHIs) - the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the World Bank Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program - finance most HIV services in Nigeria. Critics assert that GHIs burden fragile health systems in resource-poor countries and that health system limitations in these countries constrain the achievement of the objectives of GHIs. This study analyzed interactions between HIV GHIs and the Nigerian Health System and explored how the impact of the GHIs could be optimized.--NEW SECTION--A country case study was conducted using qualitative methods, including: semi-structured interviews, direct observation, and archival review. Semi-structured interviews were held with key informants selected to reach a broad range of stakeholders including policymakers, program managers, service providers, representatives of donor agencies and their implementing partners; the WHO country office in Nigeria; independent consultants; and civil society organizations involved in HIV work. The fieldwork was conducted between June and August 2013.--NEW SECTION--HIV GHIs have had a mixed impact on the health system. They have enhanced availability of and access to HIV services, improved quality of services, and strengthened health information systems and the role of non-state actors in health care. On the negative end, HIV donor funding has increased dependency on foreign aid, widened disparities in access to HIV services, done little to address the sustainability of the services, crowded out non-HIV health services, and led to the development of a parallel supply management system. They have also not invested significantly in the production of new health workers and have not addressed maldistribution problems, but have rather contributed to internal brain drain by luring health workers from the public sector to non-governmental organizations and have increased workload for existing health workers. There is poor policy direction, strategic planning and coordination, and regulation of externally-financed HIV programs by the government and this poses a great limitation to the optimal use of HIV-specific foreign aid in Nigeria.--NEW SECTION--A few reforms are necessary to improve the strengthening effect of GHIs and to minimize their negative and unintended consequences. This will require stronger leadership from the Nigerian government with regards to better coordination of externally-financed health programs. Also, donors need to play a greater role in addressing the negative consequences of foreign aid. The findings highlight important unintended consequences and system-wide impacts that get little attention in traditional program evaluation.",eng,Journal of global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Nevertheless, tumor symptoms and side effects still compromise physical activity and quality of life (QoL).--NEW SECTION--We conducted an anonymous survey among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy using standardized questionnaires: the 'Freiburger Fragebogen zur körperlichen Aktivität' (Freiburg Questionnaire on Physical Activity) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30. Two main questions were addressed: were there differences (1) in physical activity and QoL between patients who do not believe that sport could improve their QoL and those who believe it could (group A vs. B); and (2) in QoL between patients with a total activity (TA) < 18 metabolic equivalent of task (MET) h/week and those with a TA of ≥ 18 MET h/week (group C vs. D)?--NEW SECTION--276 of 400 questionnaires were completed. Groups A and B were balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. Group A suffered significantly more from fatigue and pain; group B reported higher levels of global health status (GHS) and TA. Groups C and D differed in gender distribution, age, and educational background. Group D had significantly higher levels of GHS, group C suffered more from fatigue, pain, and appetite loss.--NEW SECTION--Physical activity correlates with a better QoL of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.",eng,Oncology research and treatment,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25966337,10.1002/14651858.CD007017.pub2,Pharmaceutical policies: effects of cap and co-payment on rational use of medicines.,"Growing expenditures on prescription medicines represent a major challenge to many health systems. Cap and co-payment policies are intended as an incentive to deter unnecessary or marginal utilisation, and to reduce third-party payer expenditures by shifting parts of the financial burden from insurers to patients, thus increasing their financial responsibility for prescription medicines. Direct patient payment policies include caps (maximum numbers of prescriptions or medicines that are reimbursed), fixed co-payments (patients pay a fixed amount per prescription or medicine), co-insurance (patients pay a percentage of the price), ceilings (patients pay the full price or part of the cost up to a ceiling, after which medicines are free or are available at reduced cost) and tier co-payments (differential co-payments usually assigned to generic and brand medicines). This is the first update of the original review.--NEW SECTION--To determine the effects of cap and co-payment (cost-sharing) policies on use of medicines, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes and costs (expenditures).--NEW SECTION--For this update, we searched the following databases and websites: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Library; MEDLINE, Ovid; EMBASE, Ovid; IPSA, EBSCO; EconLit, ProQuest; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, ProQuest; PAIS International, ProQuest; INRUD Bibliography; WHOLIS, WHO; LILACS), VHL; Global Health Library WHO; PubMed, NHL; SCOPUS; SciELO, BIREME; OpenGrey; JOLIS Library Network; OECD Library; World Bank e-Library; World Health Organization, WHO; World Bank Documents & Reports; International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), WHO; ClinicalTrials.gov, NIH. We searched all databases during January and February 2013, apart from SciELO, which we searched in January 2012, and ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov, which we searched in March 2014.--NEW SECTION--We defined policies in this review as laws, rules or financial or administrative orders made by governments, non-government organisations or private insurers. We included randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series studies, repeated measures studies and controlled before-after studies of cap or co-payment policies for a large jurisdiction or system of care. To be included, a study had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: medicine use, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes or costs (expenditures).--NEW SECTION--Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study limitations. We reanalysed time series data for studies with sufficient data, if appropriate analyses were not reported.--NEW SECTION--We included 32 full-text articles (17 new) reporting evaluations of 39 different interventions (one study - Newhouse 1993 - comprises five papers). We excluded from this update eight controlled before-after studies included in the previous version of this review, because they included only one site in their intervention or control groups. Five papers evaluated caps, and six evaluated a cap with co-insurance and a ceiling. Six evaluated fixed co-payment, two evaluated tiered fixed co-payment, 10 evaluated a ceiling with fixed co-payment and 10 evaluated a ceiling with co-insurance. Only one evaluation was a randomised trial. The certainty of the evidence was found to be generally low to very low.Increasing the amount of money that people pay for medicines may reduce insurers' medicine expenditures and may reduce patients' medicine use. This may include reductions in the use of life-sustaining medicines as well as medicines that are important in treating chronic conditions and medicines for asymptomatic conditions. These types of interventions may lead to small decreases in or uncertain effects on healthcare utilisation. We found no studies that reliably reported the effects of these types of interventions on health outcomes.--NEW SECTION--The diversity of interventions and outcomes addressed across studies and differences in settings, populations and comparisons made it difficult to summarise results across studies. Cap and co-payment polices may reduce the use of medicines and reduce medicine expenditures for health insurers. However, they may also reduce the use of life-sustaining medicines or medicines that are important in treating chronic, including symptomatic, conditions and, consequently, could increase the use of healthcare services. Fixed co-payment with a ceiling and tiered fixed co-payment may be less likely to reduce the use of essential medicines or to increase the use of healthcare services.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a light-based treatment modality that has exhibited safety and efficacy in the clinic using wavelengths and irradiances achievable with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) operated on battery power. Here we assess low-cost enabling technology to extend the clinical benefit of PDT to regions with little or no access to electricity or medical infrastructure. We demonstrate the efficacy of a device based on a 635 nm high-output LED powered by three AA disposable alkaline batteries, to achieve strong cytotoxic response in monolayer and 3D cultures of A431 squamous carcinoma cells following photosensitization by administering aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to induce the accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Here we characterize challenges of battery-operated device performance, including battery drain and voltage stability specifically over relevant PDT dose parameters. Further motivated by the well-established capacity of PDT photosensitizers to serve as tumour-selective fluorescence contrast agents, we demonstrate the capability of a consumer smartphone with low-cost add-ons to measure concentration-dependent PpIX fluorescence. This study lays the groundwork for the on-going development of image-guided ALA-PDT treatment technologies for global health applications.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, there still exists a gap to develop vaccines for which there is no market in the Western world, owing to low economic incentives for the private sector to justify the investments necessary for vaccine development. In many cases, industry has the technologies, but lacks the impetus to direct resources to develop these vaccine products. The present emergency with the Ebola vaccine provides us an excellent example where a vaccine was feasible several years ago, but the global health community waited for a humanitarian disaster to direct efforts and resources to develop this vaccine. In the beginning of 2015, the first large-scale trials of two experimental vaccines against Ebola virus disease have begun in West Africa. During the past few years, several institutions have dedicated efforts to the development of vaccines against diseases present only in low-income countries. These include the International Vaccine Institute, the Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health, the Hilleman Institute, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and the Infectious Disease Research Institute. Nevertheless, solving this problem requires a more significant global effort than that currently invested. These efforts include a clear policy, global coordination of funds dedicated to the development of neglected disease and an agreement on regulatory strategies and incentives for the private sector.",eng,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The aim of this paper was to discuss results of the implant stability with data on the possible benefit for the patient's quality of life after such treatment.--NEW SECTION--For clinical outcome of implants, we evaluated 26 patients with a total number of 94 dental implants after a follow-up period of 12 to 132 months. A group of 38 patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction with free fibular flap could be included in the life-quality study. Evaluation included 23 patients with and 15 patients without implant-borne restoration. The quality of life was assessed using the standard QLQ C-30 questionnaire and the H&N35 module of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).--NEW SECTION--Of implants, 94.7 % were stable at the time of investigation and could be used for prosthesis. Patients with dental implants reported improvement of life quality along with better scores in most function and symptom scales; however, only values for global health status (QL2), absence of dyspnea (DY) and absence of feeding tube (HNFE) were significantly better than in the control group.--NEW SECTION--Dental implant insertion in fibula grafts along with implant-borne restoration is a proven concept and might lead to improved quality of life following ablative surgery of the jaw. The effect on the quality of life is not as predictable as on the implant stability.--NEW SECTION--Patients with bony defects of the jaw require bony reconstruction.

Our analysis identifies numerous transmissions of H58, including multiple transfers from Asia to Africa and an ongoing, unrecognized MDR epidemic within Africa itself. Notably, our analysis indicates that H58 lineages are displacing antibiotic-sensitive isolates, transforming the global population structure of this pathogen. H58 isolates can harbor a complex MDR element residing either on transmissible IncHI1 plasmids or within multiple chromosomal integration sites. We also identify new mutations that define the H58 lineage.

25959399,10.1111/jmwh.12293,Using the unfolding case study in midwifery education.,"One of the challenges in teaching clinicians is helping health care provider students, including midwives, develop the critical thinking and clinical decision-making skills needed for various situations encountered in practice. Health care provider students need to master the required core knowledge and skills but also need to assess, analyze, judge, decide on action, act, and evaluate their actions. Lecture-heavy classroom teaching, which is usually delivered separately from clinical experiences in health care education, focuses on knowledge acquisition, often leaving knowledge application to trial and error. Case studies are commonly used by faculty with a problem-based learning approach, which is more analytic but sometimes static. The unfolding case study presents students with a patient scenario that changes over time and allows for discussion; lecture points as needed; and decision making as the situation or condition changes, reflecting what happens in real-life clinical practice. The use of the unfolding case study moves health care provider education from fact-based lecturing to situation-based discussion and decision making as a person's condition or situation changes. Use of the unfolding case facilitates collaborative learning, covers necessary content, and assists students to think beyond the facts and use their clinical imagination. Unfolding case studies require students to begin to grasp the nature of a clinical situation and adjust interventions as the clinical situation unfolds. Steps in developing and using an unfolding case study for midwifery students are presented, including 2 examples.

Recent literature focusing on traditional regenerative medicine does not take into account the presence of a high number of active endogenous stem cells in the preterm kidney, which represents a unique opportunity for starting regenerative medicine in the perinatal period. Pluripotent cells of the blue strip have the capacity to generate new nephrons, improving kidney function in neonates and potentially protecting them from developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in adulthood. There is a marked interindividual neonatal variability of nephron numbers. Moreover, the renal stem/progenitor cells appear as densely-packed small cells with scant cytoplasm, giving rise to a blue-appearing strip in hematoxylin-eosin-stained kidney sections (""the blue strip""). There are questions concerning renal regenerative medicine: among preliminary data, the simultaneous expression of Wilms tumor 1 and thymosin β4 in stem/progenitor cells of the neonatal kidney may bring new prospects for renal regeneration applied to renal stem cells that reside in the kidney itself. A potential approach could be to prolong the 6 weeks of postnatal renal growth of nephrons or to accelerate the growth of nephrons during the 6 weeks or both. Considering what we know today about perinatal programming, this could be an important step for the future to reduce the incidence and global health impact of chronic kidney disease.",eng,Iranian journal of kidney diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Its NMR signal primarily represents glycosylated acute phase proteins. GlycA was associated with inflammation and development of cardiovascular disease in initially healthy women. We hypothesized that GlycA is a biomarker of disease activity and is associated with coronary artery atherosclerosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).--NEW SECTION--We conducted a cross-sectional study of 166 patients with RA and 90 control subjects. GlycA was measured from an NMR signal originating from N-acetylglucosamine residues on circulating glycoproteins. The relationship between GlycA and RA disease activity (Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints (DAS28)) and coronary artery calcium score was determined.--NEW SECTION--GlycA concentrations were higher in patients with RA (median (interquartile range): 398 μmol/L (348 to 473 μmol/L)) than control subjects (344 μmol/L (314 to 403 μmol/L) (P < 0.001). In RA, GlycA was strongly correlated with DAS28 based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) and DAS28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) and their components, including tender and swollen joint counts, global health score, ESR and CRP (all P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for GlycA's ability to differentiate between patients with low versus moderate to high disease activity based on DAS28-CRP was 0.75 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68, 0.83). For each quartile increase in GlycA, the odds of having coronary artery calcium increased by 48% (95% CI: 4%, 111%), independent of age, race and sex (P = 0.03).--NEW SECTION--GlycA is a novel inflammatory marker that may be useful for assessment of disease activity and is associated with coronary artery atherosclerosis in patients with RA.",eng,Arthritis research & therapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

A ""three delays"" model has been developed to describe factors influencing perinatal mortality in developing nations. This model has been validated across different World Health Organization regions and has provided the framework for policymakers to plan targeted interventions. Here, we propose a three delays model for severe sepsis in RLCs.--NEW SECTION--A literature review was performed using the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Ovid databases. Additional sources were found after review of the reference lists from retrieved articles.--NEW SECTION--We propose a three delays model for severe sepsis in adults in RLCs. The model highlights limitations in the 3 basic pillars of sepsis management: (1) sepsis recognition and diagnosis at the time of triage, (2) initial focused resuscitation, and (3) postresuscitation clinical monitoring and reassessment.--NEW SECTION--Characterizing the major barriers to effective treatment of severe sepsis in RLCs frames the problem in a language common to global health circles, which may stimulate further research, streamline treatment, and reduce sepsis-related mortality in the developing world.",eng,Journal of critical care,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Influenced by ideas of time-space compression, the global health literature argues that the world is characterised by a convergence of disease patterns and biomedical knowledge. While not denying the influence of these temporalities and spatialities of globalisation within the global health and chronic disease field, the article argues that they sit alongside other, often-conflicting notions of time and space. To do so, it explores the spatio-temporal logics that underpin a highly influential epidemiological model of the smoking epidemic. Unlike the temporalities and spatialities of sameness described in much of the global health literature, the article shows that this model is articulated around temporalities and spatialities of difference. This is not the difference celebrated by postmoderns, but the difference of modernisation theorists built around nations, sequential stages and progress. Indeed, the model, in stark contrast to the 'one world, one time, one health' globalisation mantra, divides the world into nation-states and orders them along epidemiological, geographical and development lines.",eng,Health & place,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

It has multiple social consequences which are especially profound for thyroid hormones in infertility with the aim of determining the degree of association of thyroid hormones with hyperprolactinemia in our population.--NEW SECTION--The serum levels of prolactin, T3, T4 and TSH were determined in 90 hyperprolactinemic infertile women, 90 normoprolactinemic infertile women and 50 fertile women. The hormones were assayed using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay kits.--NEW SECTION--Analysis of variance and Pearson's correlation were used to analyze the data, with the significant p-level set at 0.05.--NEW SECTION--A significantly higher mean serum prolactin and TSH were observed among the infertile groups compared to the fertile controls (p<0.05). The mean serum T3 and T4 were significantly lower in the hyperprolactinemic infertile women compared to the fertile controls (p<0.05). The mean TSH and T3 of normoprolactinemic infertile women and controls were comparable (p>0.05). However, the mean T4 was significantly lower in normoprolactinemic infertile women compared to the fertile controls (p<0.05). In all the groups, TSH correlated inversely with T3 and T4, while T3 correlated positively with T4. It was only in the control group that prolactin correlated positively and significantly with TSH.--NEW SECTION--It is therefore concluded that hyperprolactinemia with thyroid dysfunction may be a major contributory hormonal factor in infertility among infertile women and as such, estimation of prolactin, T3, T4 and TSH should be included in the workup for infertile women especially those with hyperprolactinaemia.",eng,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The objective of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence and awareness of hypertension among the inhabitants of Tibet and its association with altitude, using the data from published observational studies.--NEW SECTION--We conducted electronic searches in Medline, Embase, ISI Web of Science and Global Health. No gender or language restrictions were imposed. We assessed the methodological characteristics of included studies using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria. Two reviewers independently determined the eligibility of studies, assessed the methodology of included studies and extracted the data. We used meta-regression to estimate the degree of change in hypertension prevalence with increasing altitude.--NEW SECTION--We identified 22 eligible articles of which eight cross-sectional studies with a total of 16 913 participants were included. The prevalence of hypertension ranged between 23% and 56%. A scatter plot of altitude against overall prevalence revealed a statistically significant correlation (r=0.68; p=0.04). Meta-regression analysis revealed a 2% increase in the prevalence of hypertension with every 100 m increase in altitude (p=0.06). The locations and socioeconomic status of subjects affected the awareness and subsequent treatment and control of hypertension.--NEW SECTION--The results from cross-sectional studies suggest that there is a significant correlation between altitude and the prevalence of hypertension among inhabitants of Tibet. The socioeconomic status of the inhabitants can influence awareness and management of hypertension. Very little research into hypertension has been conducted in other prefectures of Tibet where the altitude is much higher.

Team-based learning is an educational method that relies on in-depth student preparation prior to class, individual and team knowledge assessment, and use of small-group learning to apply knowledge to complex scenarios. Although team-based learning has been studied as an approach to health care education, its application to midwifery education is not well described.--NEW SECTION--A master's-level, nurse-midwifery, didactic antepartum course was revised to a team-based learning format. Student grades, course evaluations, and aggregate American Midwifery Certification Board examination pass rates for 3 student cohorts participating in the team-based course were compared with 3 student cohorts receiving traditional, lecture-based instruction.--NEW SECTION--Students had mixed responses to the team-based learning format. Student evaluations improved when faculty added recorded lectures as part of student preclass preparation. Statistical comparisons were limited by variations across cohorts; however, student grades and certification examination pass rates did not change substantially after the course revision. Although initial course revision was time-consuming for faculty, subsequent iterations of the course required less effort.--NEW SECTION--Team-based learning provides students with more opportunity to interact during on-site classes and may spur application of knowledge into practice. However, it is difficult to assess the effect of the team-based learning approach with current measures. Further research is needed to determine the effects of team-based learning on communication and collaboration skills, as well as long-term performance in clinical practice.

There is increased demand for primary care providers, including women's health specialists such as certified nurse-midwives/certified midwives, women's health nurse practitioners, and obstetrician-gynecologists, yet shortages in numbers of these providers are expected. This deficit in the number of women's health care providers could have adverse consequences for women and their newborns when women have to travel long distances to access maternity health care. Online education using innovative technologies and evidence-based teaching and learning strategies have the potential to increase the number of health care providers in several disciplines, including midwifery. This article reviews 3 innovative uses of online platforms for midwifery education: virtual classrooms, unfolding case studies, and online return demonstrations of clinical skills. These examples of innovative teaching strategies can promote critical and creative thinking and enhance competence in skills. Their use in online education can help enhance the student experience. More students, including those who live in rural and underserved regions and who otherwise might be unable to attend a traditional onsite campus, are provided the opportunity to complete quality midwifery education through online programs, which in turn may help expand the women's health care provider workforce.

Effect sizes were computed from data extracted from study reports and were combined using random effects meta-analytic procedures.--NEW SECTION--Pictorial warnings were more effective than text-only warnings for 12 of 17 effectiveness outcomes (all p<0.05). Relative to text-only warnings, pictorial warnings (1) attracted and held attention better; (2) garnered stronger cognitive and emotional reactions; (3) elicited more negative pack attitudes and negative smoking attitudes and (4) more effectively increased intentions to not start smoking and to quit smoking. Participants also perceived pictorial warnings as being more effective than text-only warnings across all 8 perceived effectiveness outcomes.--NEW SECTION--The evidence from this international body of literature supports pictorial cigarette pack warnings as more effective than text-only warnings.

Increasing evidence suggests that obesity can also cause neuronal damage, long-term memory loss, and cognitive impairment. The leaves and the fruits of Morus alba L., containing active phytochemicals, have been shown to possess antiobesity and hypolipidemic properties. Thus, in the present study, we assessed their effects on cognitive functioning in mice fed a high-fat diet by performing immunohistochemistry, using antibodies against c-Fos, synaptophysin, and postsynaptic density protein 95 and a behavioral test. C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet for 21 weeks exhibited increased body weight, but mice coadministered an optimized Mori Folium and Mori Fructus extract mixture (2 : 1; MFE) for the final 12 weeks exhibited significant body weight loss. Additionally, obese mice exhibited not only reduced neural activity, but also decreased presynaptic and postsynaptic activities, while MFE-treated mice exhibited recovery of these activities. Finally, cognitive deficits induced by the high-fat diet were recovered by cotreatment with MFE in the novel object recognition test. Our findings suggest that the antiobesity effects of MFE resulted in recovery of the cognitive deficits induced by the high-fat diet by regulation of neural and synaptic activities.",eng,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Given its wide reach, improving the quality, completeness, and accessibility of medical information on Wikipedia could have a positive impact on global health.--NEW SECTION--We created a prototypical implementation of an automated system for keeping drug-drug interaction (DDI) information in Wikipedia up to date with current evidence about clinically significant drug interactions. Our work is based on Wikidata, a novel, graph-based database backend of Wikipedia currently in development.--NEW SECTION--We set up an automated process for integrating data from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) high priority DDI list into Wikidata. We set up exemplary implementations demonstrating how the DDI data we introduced into Wikidata could be displayed in Wikipedia articles in diverse languages. Finally, we conducted a pilot analysis to explore if adding the ONC high priority data would substantially enhance the information currently available on Wikipedia.--NEW SECTION--We derived 1150 unique interactions from the ONC high priority list. Integration of the potential DDI data from Wikidata into Wikipedia articles proved to be straightforward and yielded useful results. We found that even though the majority of current English Wikipedia articles about pharmaceuticals contained sections detailing contraindications, only a small fraction of articles explicitly mentioned interaction partners from the ONC high priority list. For 91.30% (1050/1150) of the interaction pairs we tested, none of the 2 articles corresponding to the interacting substances explicitly mentioned the interaction partner. For 7.21% (83/1150) of the pairs, only 1 of the 2 associated Wikipedia articles mentioned the interaction partner; for only 1.48% (17/1150) of the pairs, both articles contained explicit mentions of the interaction partner.--NEW SECTION--Our prototype demonstrated that automated updating of medical content in Wikipedia through Wikidata is a viable option, albeit further refinements and community-wide consensus building are required before integration into public Wikipedia is possible.

The capacity of memory T cells to ""remember"" previous cellular responses to specific antigens ultimately resides in their unique patterns of gene expression. Following re-exposure to an antigen, previously activated genes are transcribed more rapidly and robustly in memory T cells compared to their naïve counterparts. The ability for cells to remember past transcriptional responses is termed ""adaptive transcriptional memory"".--NEW SECTION--Recent global epigenome studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are central to establishing and maintaining transcriptional memory, with elegant studies in model organisms providing tantalizing insights into the epigenetic programs that contribute to adaptive immunity. These epigenetic mechanisms are diverse, and include not only classical acetylation and methylation events, but also exciting and less well-known mechanisms involving histone structure, upstream signalling pathways, and nuclear localisation of genomic regions.--NEW SECTION--Current global health challenges in areas such as tuberculosis and influenza demand not only more effective and safer vaccines, but also vaccines for a wider range of health priorities, including HIV, cancer, and emerging pathogens such as Ebola.

Treatment using interferon-based therapy in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis has been problematic due to toxicity and poor tolerability. Furthermore, interferon therapy is contraindicated in those with advanced cirrhosis or clinical decompensation, who are arguably the group most in need of viral eradication. The arrival of the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) era has resulted in the development of well-tolerated and highly effective interferon-free drug regimens that promise to dramatically change the therapeutic landscape for those with advanced HCV-related liver disease, including patients with clinical decompensation or pre-liver transplantation. Many successful DAA combinations have emerged; however, a number of challenges remain including the establishment of the optimal treatment duration, the ideal combination of drug classes and determining the role of ribavirin. Moreover, the identification of treatment-experienced patients with genotype 3 HCV cirrhosis as a difficult-to-treat subgroup is a significant impediment to overcome, as are those who have failed prior DAA therapy.

Responses were categorized using the Shiffman framework on determinants of political priority for global initiatives by two independent investigators, and the number of responses for each of the 11 factors was calculated.--NEW SECTION--Seventy-five Surgeons OverSeas members replied (75 of 176; 42.6% response rate). A total of 248 individual reasons were collected. The most common responses were related to external frame, defined as public portrayals of the issue (60 of 248; 24.2%), and lack of effective interventions (48 of 248; 19.4%). Least cited reasons related to global governance structure (4 of 248; 2.4%) and policy window (4 of 248; 1.6%).--NEW SECTION--This survey of a global surgery community identified a number of barriers to the recognition of surgical care on the global health agenda. Recommendations include improving the public portrayal of the problem; developing effective interventions and seeking strong and charismatic leadership.",eng,The Journal of surgical research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This study seeks to gain an understanding of the effects of income status on oral health in a global population of people with intellectual disabilities.--NEW SECTION--Eighty-two thousand five hundred and seventy Special Olympics athletes were screened and eligible for inclusion in this study. The main exposure (income status) and selected oral health signs and symptoms (missing teeth, untreated decay, injury, gingivitis, and mouth pain) were used to conduct a cross-sectional analysis. Prevalence odds ratios were obtained through logistic regression.--NEW SECTION--Study participants from low-income countries experienced adverse health outcomes at a lower rate than expected. Study participants from upper middle, lower middle, and low-income countries had higher odds of mouth pain and untreated decay, yet lower odds of missing teeth, injury, and gingivitis, than participants from high-income countries. Overall, a great number of individuals from every income group required maintenance or urgent care.--NEW SECTION--Oral health problems are not exclusive to low-income study participants. Unexpectedly high odds of missing teeth, injury, and gingivitis in high-income countries may be attributed to the high proportion of participants from the United States, which is considered a high-income country but has large income disparities. Health-determining circumstances in low-income countries provide some protection from the hypothesized gradient of oral health for all measured outcomes.",eng,"Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, there has been variable uptake of MC in countries with significant HIV epidemics. Kenya, for example, has embraced MC and has been dubbed a 'leader' by the global health community, while Malawi has been branded a 'laggard' in its slow adoption of a national programme, with a strong political discourse of resistance forming around MC. Regardless of any epidemiological or technical evidence, the uptake of international recommendations will be shaped by how a policy, and the specific artefacts that constitute that policy, intersect with local concerns. MC holds particular significance within many ethnic and religious groups, serving as an important rite of passage, but also designating otherness or enabling the identification of the social and political self. Understanding how the artefact of MC intersects with local social, economic, and political contexts, is therefore essential to understand the acceptance or resistance of global policy recommendations. In this paper we present an in-depth analysis of Malawi's political resistance to MC, finding that ethnic and religious divisions dominating recent political movements aligned well with differing circumcision practices. Political resistance was further found to manifest through two key narratives: a 'narrative of defiance' around the need to resist donor manipulation, and a 'narrative of doubt' which seized on a piece of epidemiological evidence to refute global claims of efficacy. Further, we found that discussions over MC served as an additional arena through which ethnic identities and claims to power could themselves be negotiated, and therefore used to support claims of political legitimacy.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The aim of this study was to identify novel candidate genes associated with TB susceptibility. We performed a population-based case-control study to genotype 13 tag SNPs spanning Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3), colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF2), IL-4, interferon beta 1 (IFNB1), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (CXCL14) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88) genes in 435 pulmonary TB patients and 375 health donors from China. We observed that EBI3 gene rs4740 polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and the allele G was associated with a protective effect against PTB. Furthermore, EBI3 deficiency led to reduced bacterial burden and histopathological impairment in the lung of mice infected with Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Meanwhile, higher abundance of EBI3 was observed in the granuloma of PTB patients and in the lung tissue of BCG-infected mice. Of note, the expression of EBI3 in macrophages was remarkably induced by mycobacteria infection at both mRNA and protein level. In conclusion, EBI3 gene rs4740 polymorphism is closely associated with susceptibility to PTB and the elevation and enrichment of EBI3 in the lung which at least partially derived from macrophages may contribute to the exacerbation of mycobacterial infection.",eng,"Tuberculosis (Edinburgh, Scotland)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25934651,10.1177/1363461515581543,For lack of wanting: Discourses of desire in Ukrainian opiate substitution therapy programs.,"Available treatments for addiction and substance abuse in Ukraine have been shaped by the economic, political, and social shifts that have followed the country's independence. The introduction of methadone-based opiate substitution therapy (OST) for opiate addicts is especially representative of this. Biomedical paradigms of addiction, its etiology, and its treatment, promoted and paid for by international donors and elite global health entities, are being met by Ukrainian notions of personhood and psychology in both public discourse and clinical settings. Ukrainian physicians who work in OST programs frequently reference desire (желание) as the most significant factor in determining the success or failure of treatment. They refer to a desire to be treated, desire to get better, desire to live. The moralized imperative to possess this desire to get better is, in many ways, a reflection of how addiction and the addicted psyche is constructed and understood in the Ukrainian context. By exploring discourses of desire in narratives of addiction and treatment, I examine how notions of psychology, will, and self-control intersect, shaping the subjectivity, agency, and daily experiences of this vulnerable population.",eng,Transcultural psychiatry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A growing body of evidence indicates that surgery can also be highly cost effective in low-income settings, but our current knowledge of the actual cost of surgery in such settings is limited. This study was carried out to obtain data on the costs of commonly performed operative procedures in a rural/semiurban setting in eastern Uganda.--NEW SECTION--A prospective, facility-based study carried out at a general district hospital (public) and a mission hospital (private, not-for-profit) in the Iganga and Mayuge districts in eastern Uganda. Items included in the cost calculations were staff time, materials and medicines, overhead costs, and capital costs.--NEW SECTION--The cost of surgery was higher at the mission hospital, with higher expenditure and lower productivity than the public hospital. The most commonly performed major procedures were caesarean section, uterine evacuation, and herniorrhaphy for groin hernia. The costs for these interventions varied between $68.4 and $74.4, $25.0 and $32.6, and $58.6 and $66.0, respectively. The most commonly performed minor procedures were circumcision, suture of cuts and lacerations, and incision and drainage of abscess. The costs for these interventions varied between $16.2 and $24.6, $15.8 and $24.3, and $10.1 and $18.6, respectively.--NEW SECTION--The cost of surgery in the study setting compares favorably with other prioritized health care interventions, such as treatment for tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS, and childhood immunization.

This article provides detailed assessments of patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a LUX-Lung 6 secondary end point, and explores the relationship between PFS and health-related quality of life (QoL) in these patients.--NEW SECTION--Patients (n = 364) were randomized (2:1) to oral afatinib (40 mg/day) or up to six cycles of cisplatin/gemcitabine (21-day cycle; cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) [d1]; gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) [d1,8]). QoL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire and its lung cancer-specific module. The relationship between PFS (investigator assessment and independent review) and QoL was evaluated using analysis of covariance and a longitudinal model.--NEW SECTION--More patients treated with afatinib versus cisplatin/gemcitabine showed improvements in global health status/QoL (p < 0.0001) and physical (p < 0.0001), role (p = 0.013), and social (p < 0.001) functioning scales. Delayed symptom deterioration and better QoL over time was also observed with afatinib. QoL measured before tumor assessment was considerably poorer for patients with progression than those without progression, with significant differences in mean scores at multiple assessment time points. Results from the longitudinal analysis consistently demonstrated a significant negative impact of progression on QoL (p < 0.0001).--NEW SECTION--Afatinib improved PFS and PROs versus chemotherapy in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC patients. Progression was associated with statistically significant worsening in QoL measured before tumor assessment, underscoring the value of PFS as a clinically relevant end point.",eng,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,"Clinical Trial, Phase III",2025-04-23,2015

Today, septic abortion is an uncommon event in the United States. The most critical treatment of septic abortion remains the prompt removal of infected tissue. Antibiotic administration and fluid resuscitation provide necessary secondary levels of treatment. Most young physicians have never treated septic abortion. Many obstetrician-gynecologists experience, or plan to experience, global health activities and will likely care for women with septic abortion. Thus, updated knowledge of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, microbes, and proper treatment is needed to optimally treat this emergency condition when it exists. The pathophysiology of septic abortion involves infection of the placenta, especially the maternal villous space that leads to a high frequency of bacteremia. Symptoms and signs range from mild to severe. The microbes involved are usually common vaginal bacteria, including anaerobes, but occasionally potentially very serious and lethal infection is caused by bacteria that produce toxins. The primary treatment is early curettage to remove infected and devitalized tissue even in the face of continued fetal heart tones. Important secondary treatments are the administration of fluids and antibiotics. Updated references of sepsis and septic shock are reviewed.",eng,Obstetrics and gynecology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The HCV treatment landscape has been transformed recently by the introduction of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents that target viral proteins, including the NS3 protease, the NS5B polymerase, and the NS5A protein. Treatment with multiple DAAs in combination has been shown to result in high rates of sustained virologic response, without the need for pegylated interferon, and a shorter duration of therapy compared with interferon-based regimens; however, the optimal combination of DAAs has yet to be determined. The class of NS5A inhibitors has picomolar potency with pangenotypic activity, and recent clinical studies have shown these inhibitors to be an important component of DAA combination regimens. This review discusses the rational design of an optimal anti-HCV DAA cocktail, with a focus on the role of NS5A in the HCV life cycle, the attributes of the NS5A class of inhibitors, and the potential for NS5A inhibitors to act as a scaffold for DAA-only treatment regimens.",eng,Hepatic medicine : evidence and research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Given the multifactorial nature of DM, the mechanisms that underlie reproductive dysfunction remain unclear. Considering that hyperglycemia has been described as a major effector of the disease pathophysiology, we used an in vitro approach to address the isolated effect of high glucose conditions on human sperm function, thus avoiding other in vivo confounding players. We performed a complete and integrated analysis by measuring a variety of important indicators of spermatozoa functionality (such as motility, viability, capacitation status, acrosomal integrity, mitochondrial superoxide production and membrane potential) in human sperm samples after incubation with d- and l-glucose (5, 25, or 50 mM) for 24 and 48 h. No direct effects promoted by 25 or 50 mM d-glucose were found for any of the parameters assessed (P>0.05), except for the acrosome reaction, which was potentiated after 48 h of exposure to 50 mM d-glucose (P<0.05). Interestingly, non-metabolizable l-glucose drastically increased superoxide production (P<0.05) and suppressed sperm motility (P<0.05) and capacitation (P<0.05) after 24 h of treatment, whereas mitochondrial membrane potential (P<0.05), acrosomal integrity (P<0.01) and viability (P<0.05) were later decreased. The overall results suggest that high glucose levels per se do not influence human sperm function in vitro, which stresses the importance of other factors involved in DM pathology. Nevertheless, the absence of metabolizable glucose contributes to a severe impairment of sperm function and thus compromises male fertility.",eng,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We estimate the global macroeconomic impact of the surgical burden of disease due to injury, neoplasm, digestive diseases, and maternal and neonatal disorders from two distinct economic perspectives.--NEW SECTION--We obtained mortality rate estimates for each disease for the years 2000 and 2010 from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation Global Burden of Disease 2010 study, and estimates of the proportion of the burden of the selected diseases that is surgical from a paper by Shrime and colleagues. We first used the value of lost output (VLO) approach, based on the WHO's Projecting the Economic Cost of Ill-Health (EPIC) model, to project annual market economy losses due to these surgical diseases during 2015-30. EPIC attempts to model how disease affects a country's projected labour force and capital stock, which in turn are related to losses in economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP). We then used the value of lost welfare (VLW) approach, which is conceptually based on the value of a statistical life and is inclusive of non-market losses, to estimate the present value of long-run welfare losses resulting from mortality and short-run welfare losses resulting from morbidity incurred during 2010. Sensitivity analyses were performed for both approaches.--NEW SECTION--During 2015-30, the VLO approach projected that surgical conditions would result in losses of 1·25% of potential GDP, or $20·7 trillion (2010 US$, purchasing power parity) in the 128 countries with data available. When expressed as a proportion of potential GDP, annual GDP losses were greatest in low-income and middle-income countries, with up to a 2·5% loss in output by 2030. When total welfare losses are assessed (VLW), the present value of economic losses is estimated to be equivalent to 17% of 2010 GDP, or $14·5 trillion in the 175 countries assessed with this approach. Neoplasm and injury account for greater than 95% of total economic losses with each approach, but maternal, digestive, and neonatal disorders, which represent only 4% of losses in high-income countries with the VLW approach, contribute to 26% of losses in low-income countries.--NEW SECTION--The macroeconomic impact of surgical disease is substantial and inequitably distributed. When paired with the growing number of favourable cost-effectiveness analyses of surgical interventions in low-income and middle-income countries, our results suggest that building surgical capacity should be a global health priority.--NEW SECTION--US National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute.",eng,The Lancet.

However, previous efforts to integrate surgical services into global health initiatives do not reflect the scope of surgical need and many health systems do not provide essential interventions. We estimate the minimum global volume of surgical need to address prevalent diseases in 21 epidemiological regions from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD).--NEW SECTION--Prevalence data were obtained from GBD 2010 and organised into 119 disease states according to the WHO's Global Health Estimate (GHE). These data, representing 187 countries, were then apportioned into the 21 GBD epidemiological regions. Using previously defined values for the incident need for surgery for each of the 119 GHE disease states, we calculate minimum global need for surgery based on the prevalence of each condition in each region.--NEW SECTION--We estimate that at least 321·5 million surgical procedures would be needed to address the burden of disease for a global population of 6·9 billion in 2010. Minimum rates of surgical need vary across regions, ranging from 3383 operations per 100 000 in central Latin America to 6495 operations per 100 000 in western sub-Saharan Africa. Global surgical need also varied across subcategories of disease, ranging from 131 412 procedures for nutritional deficiencies to 45·8 million procedures for unintentional injuries.--NEW SECTION--The estimated need for surgical procedures worldwide is large and addresses a broad spectrum of disease states. Surgical need varies between regions of the world according to disease prevalence and many countries do not meet the basic needs of their populations.

We built a chance tree for each country to model the probability of surgical access with respect to each dimension, and from this we constructed a statistical model to estimate the proportion of the population in each country that does not have access to surgical services. We accounted for uncertainty with one-way sensitivity analyses, multiple imputation for missing data, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.--NEW SECTION--At least 4·8 billion people (95% posterior credible interval 4·6-5·0 [67%, 64-70]) of the world's population do not have access to surgery.

The number of diabetic people in world is expected to rise to 366 million in 2030. The available drugs for diabetes, insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents have one or more side effects and search for new antidiabetic drugs with minimal or no side effects from medicinal plants is a challenging for us. The present study was undertaken to investigate the antidiabetic and antioxidant activity of Semecarpus anacardium (Linn.) (abbreviated as SF).--NEW SECTION--The antidiabetic activity was determined by using alloxan-induced diabetic rats. After 15 days of treatment, serum biochemical parameters such as TC, TG, LDL, HDL, SGOT and SGPT were estimated. The survival rate, body weight, organ weight, liver glycogen and blood parameters (RBC and Hb) were also measured. The antioxidant activity was measured by DPPH free radical scavenging assay. Phytochemical screening, total phenolic and total flavonoid content were determined by using standard methods.--NEW SECTION--The results showed that the survival rate was 100% in rats of Group SA 400. The effect of extract on blood glucose level in Groups SA 100, SA 200 and SA 400 were dose-dependent throughout the treatment period. No significant changes in organ weight to body weight ratio were observed, liver weights significantly improved in Groups SA 200 and SA 400. The bark extract exhibited significant (p < 0.05) anti-diabetic activity with lowering TC, TG, LDL level dose-dependently and protected liver which may be partially explained by attenuation of SGOT and SGPT levels and increases liver glycogen. The percentage of Hb and RBC counts were negatively correlated with the doses of extracts.

This trend is likely contributed to by multiple factors, chief among which is the increase in trade and human movement in and out of China from the Southeast Asian region where dengue is firmly endemic. However, a holistic picture of dengue in China and how the public health authorities are responding to this global health challenge has been missing. In a research article published in BMC Medicine, Lai et al. have now filled this gap in knowledge by analysing statutorily mandated national dengue surveillance data from 1990 till 2014. They also conducted time series analyses to identify key drivers of dengue transmission in south China as well as from south China to the other parts of this vast and populous country. Their findings, as well as the description of surveillance and disease control activities in China, highlight urgent steps that need to be taken if China wishes to prevent itself from becoming another country that experiences large and frequent cycles of epidemic dengue.",eng,BMC medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

A TB vaccine should be safe and immunogenic as well as efficacious in all affected populations, including HIV-infected individuals. We investigated the induction and maintenance of vaccine-induced memory CD4(+) T cells following vaccination with the subunit vaccine H1/IC31. H1/IC31 was inoculated twice on study days 0 and 56 among HIV-infected adults with CD4(+) lymphocyte counts of >350 cells/mm(3). Whole venous blood stimulation was conducted with the H1 protein, and memory CD4(+) T cells were analyzed using intracellular cytokine staining and polychromatic flow cytometry. We identified high responders, intermediate responders, and nonresponders based on detection of interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) expressing central (TCM) and effector memory CD4(+) T cells (TEM) 182 days after the first immunization. Amplicon-based transcript quantification using next-generation sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes that correlated with vaccine-induced immune responses. Genes implicated in resolution of inflammation discriminated the responders from the nonresponders 3 days after the first inoculation. The volunteers with higher expression levels of genes involved in antiviral innate immunity at baseline showed impaired H1-specific TCM and TEM maintenance 6 months after vaccination. Our study showed that in HIV-infected volunteers, expression levels of genes involved in the antiviral innate immune response affected long-term maintenance of H1/IC31 vaccine-induced cellular immunity.

In 2012, there were 94,000 HIV-positive pregnant women in Mozambique. Approximately 15% of these women transmitted HIV to their newborn infants, resulting in nearly 14,000 new pediatric HIV infections that year. To address this issue, in 2013, the Mozambican Ministry of Health implemented the World Health Organization-recommended ""Option B+"" strategy in which all newly diagnosed HIV-positive pregnant women are counseled to initiate combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART) immediately upon diagnosis regardless of CD4 count and to continue treatment for life. Given the limited experience with Option B+ in sub-Saharan Africa, few rigorous pragmatic trials have studied this new treatment strategy.--NEW SECTION--This study utilizes an initial formative research process involving patient and health care provider interviews and focus groups, workforce assessments, value stream mapping, and commodity utilization assessments to understand the strengths and weaknesses in the current Option B+ care cascade. The formative research is intended to guide identification and prioritization of key workflow modifications and the development of an enhanced adherence and retention package. These two components are bundled into a defined intervention implemented and evaluated across six health facilities utilizing a stepped wedge randomized controlled trial study design. The overall objective of this trial is to develop and test a pilot intervention in central Mozambique to implement the new Option B+ guidelines with high fidelity and increase the proportion of HIV-positive pregnant women in target antenatal clinics (ANC) who start ART prior to delivery and are retained in care.--NEW SECTION--This pragmatic study utilizes research strategies that have the potential to meaningfully improve the Option B+ care cascade in central Mozambique and to decrease the MTCT of HIV. This trial is designed to identify critical low-cost improvement strategies that can be bundled into a defined intervention. If this intervention has a measurable impact, it can be rapidly scaled up to other ANC in Mozambique and sub-Saharan Africa.--NEW SECTION--ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02371265.",eng,Implementation science : IS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25921605,10.14348/molcells.2015.0005,Increased methylation of interleukin 6 gene is associated with obesity in Korean women.,"Obesity is the fifth leading risk for death globally, and a significant challenge to global health. It is a common, complex, non-malignant disease and develops due to interactions between the genes and the environment. DNA methylation can act as a downstream effector of environmental signals; analysis of this process therefore holds substantial promise for identifying mechanisms through which genetic and environmental factors jointly contribute to disease risk. To assess the effects of excessive weight and obesity on gene-specific methylation levels of promoter regions, we determined the methylation status of four genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress [interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and glucose transport 4 (GLUT4)] in blood cell-derived DNA from healthy women volunteers with a range of body mass indices (BMIs) by methylation-specific PCR. Interestingly, the samples from obese individuals (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) showed significantly increased hypermethylation for IL6 gene compared to normal weight (BMI < 23 kg/m(2)) and overweight samples (23 kg/m(2) ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m(2)) (P = 0.034 and P = 0.026). However, there was no statistically significant difference in promoter methylation of the other 3 genes between each group. These findings suggest that aberrant DNA methylation of IL6 gene promoter may play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of obesity and IL6 methylation could be used as molecular biomarker for obesity risk assessment. Further studies are required to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship.",eng,Molecules and cells,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Although most of these major infectious diseases are treatable, the early identification of individuals requiring treatment remains a major issue. The incidence of these diseases would be reduced if rapid diagnostic tests were widely available at the community and primary care level in low-resource settings. Strong research efforts are thus being focused on replacing standard clinical diagnostic methods, such as the invasive detection techniques (biopsy or endoscopy) or expensive diagnostic and monitoring methods, by affordable and sensitive tests based on novel biomarkers. The development of new methods that are needed includes solid-phase separation techniques. In this context, the integration of magnetic particles within bioassays and biosensing devices is very promising since they greatly improve the performance of a biological reaction. The diagnosis of clinical samples with magnetic particles can be easily achieved without pre-enrichment, purification or pretreatment steps often required for standard methods, simplifying the analytical procedures. The biomarkers can be specifically isolated and preconcentrated from complex biological matrixes by magnetic actuation, increasing specificity and the sensitivity of the assay. This review addresses these promising features of the magnetic particles for the detection of biomarkers in emerging technologies related with infectious diseases affecting global health, such as malaria, influenza, dengue, tuberculosis or HIV.",eng,New biotechnology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The final sequalae of cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma are often the result of inflammation driven by intrahepatic lymphocytes. Accurate assessment of organ-specific diseases ideally employs tissue sampling though this is rarely performed. Here we report our experiences of utilising repeated fine needle aspirations (FNAs) to assess liver-derived leukocytes. In 88 patient samples, we obtained a mean of 36,959 lymphocytes from each FNA-derived biopsy (SD 22,319 cells, range 5034-91,242 cells) measured by flow cytometry. This quick technique required minimal analgesia compared to liver biopsy (p = 0.03); was well tolerated and safe, and hence repeated sampling up to 3 times within a week was feasible. We detail the technique to rapidly derive a single cell suspension suitable for multiparameter flow cytometry analysis. Finally we illustrate the importance of organ-derived sampling by showing that natural killer (NK) cells from FNA samples have a markedly altered phenotype compared to those assessed in peripheral blood. In combination these data validate FNA as a powerful and well-tolerated method of sampling intrahepatic lymphocytes to study the immunology of acute and chronic liver diseases.",eng,Journal of immunological methods,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Unfortunately, the emergence of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), which includes multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), has greatly affected the treatment of TB. Anti-TB chemotherapy drugs are classified into five groups to facilitate application of effective guidelines for the treatment regimen. However, chemotherapy has a limited ability to treat DR-TB, and therefore a novel alternative treatment for DR-TB is required. In this review, we focused on photodynamic therapy (PDT) as potential treatment for DR-TB. PDT is a widely used cancer treatment that combines photosensitizers and harmless laser light to produce reactive oxygen species that selectively damage the target cells. Initially, PDT was originally developed to target pathogenic microorganisms but fell into disuse because of adverse reactions. Recently, photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy is attracting attention again as an alternative treatment for bacterial infections. In our previous study, we suggested that PDT could be a novel option to treat MDR- and XDR-TB in vitro. Despite the limited previous studies regarding PDT in TB models, fast-developing bronchoscopic technologies and clinician experience will soon facilitate the clinical application of safe and minimally invasive PDT for TB.",eng,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

High-calorie/high-fat food is a major cause for these global health issues, but molecular mechanisms underlying high-fat, diet-induced obesity are still not well understood. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor that acts as a xenobiotic sensor, mediates environmental toxicant-induced obesity, insulin resistance and development of diabetes. AhR also influences lipid metabolism and diet-induced obesity. The effects of AhR deficiency on diet-induced obesity, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance were examined.--NEW SECTION--Male wild-type (WT), AhR null (AhR(-/-)) and AhR heterozygote (AhR(+/-)) mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD, 10% kcal from fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal from fat) for up to 14 weeks. Adiposity, adipose and liver morphology, insulin signaling, metabolic parameters and gene profiles were assessed.--NEW SECTION--AhR deficiency protected against HFD-induced obesity, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and inflammation. Moreover, AhR deficiency preserved insulin signaling in major metabolic tissues. These protective effects result from a higher energy expenditure in AhR-deficient mice compared with WT. Levels of transcript for both the thermogenic gene, uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), in brown adipose tissue and mitochondrial β-oxidation genes in muscle were significantly higher in AhR(-/-) and AhR(+/-) mice compared with WT.--NEW SECTION--This work documents a physiologically relevant function for AhR in regulation of body weight, hepatic fat deposition, insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure under HFD exposure, suggesting that AhR signaling may be developed as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders.",eng,International journal of obesity (2005),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In doing so, I argue that moving forward with the agenda Shiffman sets out requires social scientists interested in the global politics of health to be reflexive about our own exercise of structural and productive power and the fact that researching global health politics is itself a political undertaking.",eng,International journal of health policy and management,Comment,2025-04-23,2015

The aim of this trial was to determine the effect of probiotic fermented milk (kefir) on glucose and lipid profile control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.--NEW SECTION--This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 diabetic patients aged 35 to 65 years.Patients were randomly and equally (n=30) assigned to consume either probiotic fermented milk (kefir) or conventional fermented milk (dough) for 8 weeks. Probiotic group consumed 600 ml/day probiotic fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria and control group consumed 600 ml/day conventional fermented milk.Blood samples tested for fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C at the baseline and end of the study.--NEW SECTION--The comparison of fasting blood glucose between two groups after intervention was statistically significant (P=0.01). After intervention, reduced HbA1C compared with the baseline value in probiotic fermented milk group was statistically significant (P=0.001), also the HbA1C level significantly decreased in probiotic group in comparison with control group (P=0.02) adjusting for serum levels of glucose, baseline values of HbA1c and energy intake according to ANCOVA model.

Reconstruction, rehabilitation and development initiatives start increasingly earlier after crisis, unleashing tensions between development and humanitarian paradigms. Recently, development aid shows specific interest in contexts affected by conflict and fragility, with increasing expectations for health interventions to demonstrate transformative potential, including towards more resilient health systems as a contribution to state-building agendas.--NEW SECTION--Current drives towards state-building opportunities in health interventions is mainly based on political aspirations, with little conclusive evidence on linking state-building efforts to conflict prevention, neither on transformative effects of health systems support. Moreover, negative consequences are possible in such volatile environments. We explore how to anticipate, discuss and monitor potential negative effects of current state-building approaches on health interventions, including on humanitarian aid. Overriding health systems approaches might increase tension in fragile and conflict affected contexts, because at odds with goals typically associated with immediate emergency response to populations' needs. Especially in protracted crisis, quality and timeliness of humanitarian response can be compromised, with strain on impartiality, targeting the most vulnerable, prioritising direct health benefits and most effective strategies. State-building focus could shift health aid priorities away from sick people and disease. Precedence of state institutions support over immediate, effective health service delivery can reduce population level results. As consequence people might question health workers' intention to privilege health above political, ethnic or other alliances, altering health and humanitarian workers' perception. Particularly in conflict, neither health system nor state are impartial bystanders.--NEW SECTION--In spite of scarce evidence on benefits of health systems support for state-building, current dominant line of thought among donors might influence aid strategies and modalities in settings of crisis, conflict and longer-term health system fragility. Negative consequences may arise from dominance of political agendas over health needs, with risk for effectiveness, nature and perception of health interventions. Potential effects in at least three key health areas merit critical review: quality of humanitarian health interventions, tangible contributions to population level health benefits, perception of health and humanitarian workers. To keep health needs as yardstick to determine effective health and humanitarian priority investments, is challenging.",eng,Conflict and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Current antiviral therapies with nucleoside analogues can inhibit the replication of HBV, but do not disrupt the already existing HBV covalently closed circular DNA. The newly developed CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated 9) system is a powerful tool to target cellular genome DNA for gene editing. In order to investigate the possibility of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt the HBV DNA templates, we designed eight guide RNAs (gRNAs) that targeted the conserved regions of different HBV genotypes, which could significantly inhibit HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the HBV-specific gRNA/Cas9 system could inhibit the replication of HBV of different genotypes in cells, and the viral DNA was significantly reduced by a single gRNA/Cas9 system and cleared by a combination of different gRNA/Cas9 systems.",eng,The Journal of general virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

HRQoL was assessed over time for five preselected scales (global health (GH), physical (PF) and social functioning (SF), motor dysfunction (MD) and communication deficit (CD)). Moreover, mean changes in HRQoL from baseline until progression were determined.--NEW SECTION--138/148 patients with at least a baseline HRQoL assessment were analysed. Over time, HRQoL remained relatively stable in all treatment arms for all five scales, at least during the first three treatment cycles. More than half (54-61%) of the patients showed stable (<10 point change) or improved (⩾10 point change) HRQoL during their progression-free time, except for SF (43%), irrespective of treatment arm. Deterioration of mean HRQoL was most profound at disease progression for all scales except SF, which deteriorated earlier in disease course.

25896063,10.1038/ijo.2015.59,Physiological adaptations to weight loss and factors favouring weight regain.,"Obesity is a major global health problem and predisposes individuals to several comorbidities that can affect life expectancy. Interventions based on lifestyle modification (for example, improved diet and exercise) are integral components in the management of obesity. However, although weight loss can be achieved through dietary restriction and/or increased physical activity, over the long term many individuals regain weight. The aim of this article is to review the research into the processes and mechanisms that underpin weight regain after weight loss and comment on future strategies to address them. Maintenance of body weight is regulated by the interaction of a number of processes, encompassing homoeostatic, environmental and behavioural factors. In homoeostatic regulation, the hypothalamus has a central role in integrating signals regarding food intake, energy balance and body weight, while an 'obesogenic' environment and behavioural patterns exert effects on the amount and type of food intake and physical activity. The roles of other environmental factors are also now being considered, including sleep debt and iatrogenic effects of medications, many of which warrant further investigation. Unfortunately, physiological adaptations to weight loss favour weight regain. These changes include perturbations in the levels of circulating appetite-related hormones and energy homoeostasis, in addition to alterations in nutrient metabolism and subjective appetite. To maintain weight loss, individuals must adhere to behaviours that counteract physiological adaptations and other factors favouring weight regain. It is difficult to overcome physiology with behaviour. Weight loss medications and surgery change the physiology of body weight regulation and are the best chance for long-term success. An increased understanding of the physiology of weight loss and regain will underpin the development of future strategies to support overweight and obese individuals in their efforts to achieve and maintain weight loss.",eng,International journal of obesity (2005),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25893588,10.1007/s10549-015-3383-6,"A review of systematic reviews of the cost-effectiveness of hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy for breast cancer.","Breast cancer is a global health concern. In fact, breast cancer is the primary cause of death among women worldwide and constitutes the most expensive malignancy to treat. As health care resources are finite, decisions regarding the adoption and coverage of breast cancer treatments are increasingly being based on ""value for money,"" i.e., cost-effectiveness. As the evidence about the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer treatments is abundant, therefore difficult to navigate, systematic reviews of published systematic reviews offer the advantage of bringing together the results of separate systematic reviews in a single report. As a consequence, this paper presents an overview of systematic reviews of the cost-effectiveness of hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy for breast cancer to inform policy and reimbursement decision-making. A systematic review was conducted of published systematic reviews documenting cost-effectiveness analyses of breast cancer treatments from 2000 to 2014. Systematic reviews identified through a literature search of health and economic databases were independently assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Systematic reviews of original evaluations were included only if they targeted breast cancer patients and specific breast cancer treatments (hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy only), documented incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and were reported in the English language. The search strategy used a combination of these key words: ""breast cancer,"" ""systematic review/meta-analysis,"" and ""cost-effectiveness/economics."" Data were extracted using predefined extraction forms and qualitatively appraised using the assessment of multiple systematic reviews (AMSTAR) tool. The literature search resulted in 511 bibliographic records, of which ten met our inclusion criteria. Five reviews were conducted in the early-stage breast cancer setting and five reviews in the metastatic setting. In early-stage breast cancer, evidence about trastuzumab value differed by age. Trastuzumab was cost-effective only in women with HER2-positive breast cancer younger than 65 years and over a life-time horizon. The cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer yielded conflicting results. The same conclusions were reached in comparisons between vinorelbine and taxanes. In both early stage and advanced/metastatic breast cancer, newer aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have proved cost-effective compared to older treatments. This overview of systematic reviews shows that there is heterogeneity in the evidence concerning the cost-effectiveness of hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy for breast cancer. The cost-effectiveness of these treatments depends not only on the comparators but the context, i.e., adjuvant or metastatic setting, subtype of patient population, and perspective adopted. Decisions involving the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer treatments could be made easier and more transparent by better harmonizing the reporting of economic evaluations assessing the value of these treatments.",eng,Breast cancer research and treatment,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

For example, surveys show that more than half of residency programs now offer international electives. Residency programs are increasingly recognizing that global health training improves communication skills, fosters awareness of health disparities, and inspires careers in primary care and public health. Although research has focused on global health education in other specialties, there is a paucity of research on global health training in public health and general preventive medicine (GPM). We sought to describe the extent of global health training across GPM residencies, capture the perspectives of program directors regarding competencies residents need for careers in global health, and identify program directors' perceived barriers to providing global health training. The survey was sent electronically to 42 U.S. GPM residency program directors from September to October 2013. Twenty-three completed surveys were returned. Information from residencies that did not complete the study survey was collected through a predefined search protocol. Data analysis was performed from February through July 2014.

The international community is presently developing a set of Sustainable Development Goals as the successor framework to the MDGs. This review examines the evidence base for the current health-related proposals in relation to disease burden and the technical and political feasibility of interventions to achieve the targets. In contrast to the MDGs, the proposed health agenda aspires to be universally applicable to all countries and is appropriately broad in encompassing both communicable and non-communicable diseases as well as emerging burdens from, among other things, road traffic accidents and pollution.We argue that success in realizing the agenda requires a paradigm shift in the way we address global health to surmount five challenges: 1) ensuring leadership for intersectoral coherence and coordination on the structural (including social, economic, political and legal) drivers of health; 2) shifting the focus from treatment to prevention through locally-led, politically-smart approaches to a far broader agenda; 3) identifying effective means to tackle the commercial determinants of ill-health; 4) further integrating rights-based approaches; and 5) enhancing civic engagement and ensuring accountability.

The Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) movement needs to focus on developing the capacity of local organizations and the institutions that influence how such organizations interact with local and international stakeholders.--NEW SECTION--While institutions can enable organizations, they too often apply requirements to follow paths that can stifle learning and development. Global health actors have recognized the importance of supporting local organizations in HSS activities. However, this recognition has yet to translate adequately into actual policies to influence funding and practice. While there is not a single approach to HSS that can be uniformly applied to all contexts, several messages emerge from the experience of successful health systems presented in this paper using case studies through a complex adaptive systems lens. Two key messages deserve special attention: the need for donors and recipient organizations to work as equal partners, and the need for strong and diffuse leadership in low-income countries. An increasingly dynamic and interdependent post-Millennium Development Goals (post-MDG) world requires new ways of working to improve global health, underpinned by a complex adaptive systems lens and approaches that build local organizational capacity.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

As targeting individuals alone does not seem to be an effective strategy to reduce maternal mortality (Millennium Development Goal 5), the present study sought to reveal the role of many distant macrostructural factors affecting maternal mortality at the global level.--NEW SECTION--After preparing a global dataset, 439 indicators were selected from nearly 1800 indicators based on their relevance and the application of proper inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to assess the relationship between these indicators and maternal mortality. Only indicators with statistically significant correlation more than 0.2, and missing values less than 20% were maintained. Due to the high multicollinearity among the remaining indicators, after missing values analysis and imputation, factor analysis was performed with principal component analysis as the method of extraction. Ten factors were finally extracted and entered into a multiple regression analysis.--NEW SECTION--The findings of this study not only consolidated the results of earlier studies about maternal mortality, but also added new evidence. Education (std. B = -0.442), private sector and trade (std. B = -0.316), and governance (std. B = -0.280) were found to be the most important macrostructural factors associated with maternal mortality. Employment and labor structure, economic policy and debt, agriculture and food production, private sector infrastructure investment, and health finance were also some other critical factors. These distal factors explained about 65% of the variability in maternal mortality between different countries.--NEW SECTION--Decreasing maternal mortality requires dealing with various factors other than individual determinants including political will, reallocation of national resources (especially health resources) in the governmental sector, education, attention to the expansion of the private sector trade and improving spectrums of governance. In other words, sustainable reduction in maternal mortality (as a development indicator) will depend on long-term planning for multi-faceted development. Moreover, trade, debt, political stability, and strength of legal rights can be affected by elements outside the borders of countries and global determinants. These findings are believed to be beneficial for sustainable development in Post-2015 Development Agenda.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Studies show that girls in many countries experience menarche with insufficient information and support. Girls from around the world report feeling ashamed and afraid. The potential health effects of such experiences include a weakening of girls' sense of self-confidence and competence, which in turn may comprise girls' abilities to assert themselves in different situations, including in relation to their sexuality and sexual and reproductive health. There is an important need for the public health community to assure that girls receive the education and support they need about menstruation, so they are able to feel more confident about their bodies, and navigate preventable health problems - now and in the future. For too long, the global health community has overlooked the window of opportunity presented by menarche. Family planning programs have generally focused their efforts on married couples and HIV programs have focused safer sex promotion on older adolescent girls and boys. Starting the conversation at menarche with girls in early adolescence would fully use this window of opportunity. It would engage young adolescent girls and be a natural first step for later, more comprehensive conversations about sexuality, reproduction and reproductive health. There are a number of initiatives beginning to tackle the provision of puberty information to girls and boys, but the global health community is overdue to set a global standard for the provision of such guidance.",eng,Reproductive health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

While it is established that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are facing shortages in human resources for health (HRH), there has been little systematic attention focussed on non-clinical competencies. In response, we developed a framework that defines the minimum health information competencies required by health workers at various levels of a health system.--NEW SECTION--Using the Delphi method, we consulted with leading global health information system (HIS) experts. An initial list of competencies and draft framework were developed based on results of a systematic literature review. During the second half of 2012, we sampled 38 experts with broad-based HIS knowledge and extensive development experience. Two rounds of consultation were carried out with the same group to establish validity of the framework and gain feedback on the draft competencies. Responses from consultations were analysed using Qualtrics® software and content analysis.--NEW SECTION--In round one, 17 experts agreed to participate in the consultation and 11 (65%) completed the survey. In the second round, 11 experts agreed to participate and eight (73%) completed the survey. Overall, respondents agreed that there is a need for all health workers to have basic HIS competencies and that the concept of a minimum HIS competency framework is valid. Consensus was reached around the inclusion of 68 competencies across four levels of a health system.--NEW SECTION--This consultation is one of the first to identify the HIS competencies required among general health workers, as opposed to specialist HIS roles.

Time-of-addition experiments and inactivation of enzymatic activities of the venoms were carried out to determine the characteristics of the anti-HCV activities.--NEW SECTION--S. maurus palmatus and A. australis venoms showed anti-HCV activities, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC₅₀) being 6.3 ± 1.6 and 88.3 ± 5.8 μg/ml, respectively. S. maurus palmatus venom (30 μg/ml) impaired HCV infectivity in culture medium, but not inside the cells, through virocidal effect. The anti-HCV activity of this venom was not inhibited by a metalloprotease inhibitor or heating at 60°C. The antiviral activity was directed preferentially against HCV.--NEW SECTION--S. maurus palmatus venom is considered as a good natural source for characterization and development of novel anti-HCV agents targeting the entry step. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing antiviral activities of Egyptian scorpion venoms against HCV, and may open a new approach towards discovering antiviral compounds derived from scorpion venoms.",eng,Virology journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The potential effects of inorganic nitrate/nitrite on global health are a much debated issue. In addition to possible methemoglobinemia and carcinogenic properties, anti-thyroid effects of nitrate/nitrite have been suggested. Considering the growing significance of nitrate/nitrite and since there is no comprehensive review in data available, clarifying the effect of nitrate/nitrite on thyroid disorder outcomes is essential. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review of experimental and clinical studies, and a meta-analysis of relevant cohort and cross-sectional studies investigating the association of nitrate/nitrite exposure and thyroid function. Most animal studies show that high exposure (~10-600 times of acceptable daily intake) to nitrate/nitrite induces anti-thyroid effects, including decreased serum level of thyroid hormones and histomorphological changes in thyroid gland; however no similar observations have been documented in humans. Based on our meta-analysis, no significant association was observed between nitrate exposure and the risk of thyroid cancer, hyper- and hypothyroidism; findings from three cohort studies however showed a significant association between higher exposure to nitrite and the risk of thyroid cancer (risk = 1.48, 95% confidence interval = 1.09-2.02, P = 0.012). Additional research is needed to clarify the association between nitrate/nitrite exposures and both thyroid function and cancer.",eng,Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25888485,10.1186/s12875-015-0241-x,Geriatric screening tools are of limited value to predict decline in functional status and quality of life: results of a cohort study.,"Geriatric screening tools are increasingly implemented in daily practice, especially in the oncology setting, but also in primary care in some countries such as the Netherlands. Nonetheless, validation of these tools regarding their ability to predict relevant outcomes is lacking. In this study we evaluate if geriatric screening tools predict decline in functional status and quality of life after one year, in a population of older cancer patients and an older primary care population without cancer with a life expectancy of at least six months.--NEW SECTION--Older cancer patients and a general older primary care population without a history of cancer (≥ 70 years) were included in an on-going prospective cohort study. Data were collected at baseline and after one-year follow-up. Functional decline was based on the Katz Index and Lawton IADL-scale and was defined as deterioration on one or more domains. Decline in quality of life was measured using the global health related subscale of the EORTC QLQ-C30, and was defined as a decline ≥ 10 points. The selected geriatric screening tools were the abbreviated Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, Groningen Frailty Indicator, Vulnerable Elders Survey-13, and G8. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and odds ratios to assess if normal versus abnormal scores predict functional decline and decline in quality of life.--NEW SECTION--One-year follow-up data were available for 134 older cancer patients and 220 persons without cancer. Abnormal scores of all screening tools were significantly associated with functional decline. However, this was only true for older persons without cancer, and only in univariate analyses. For functional decline, sensitivity ranged from 54% to 71% and specificity from 33% to 66%. For decline in quality of life, sensitivity ranged from 40% to 67% and specificity from 37% to 54%.--NEW SECTION--In older persons with a relatively good prognosis, geriatric screening tools are of limited use in identifying persons at risk for decline in functional status or quality of life after one year. Hence, a geriatric screening tool cannot be relied on in isolation, but they do provide very valuable information and may prompt physicians to also consider different aspects of functioning.",eng,BMC family practice,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Inequities between low-, middle-, and high-income countries affect disease burden and the infrastructure needs in response to cancer. We surveyed early-career oncologists attending workshops in clinical research in three countries with emerging economies about their perception of the evolving cancer burden.--NEW SECTION--A cross-sectional survey questionnaire was distributed at clinical trial concept development workshops held in Beijing, Lahore, Karachi, and Mumbai at major hospitals to acquire information regarding home-country health conditions and needs.--NEW SECTION--A total of 100 respondents participated in the workshops held at major hospitals in the region (India = 29, China = 25, Pakistan = 42, and other = 4). Expected consensus on many issues (e.g., emergence of cancer as a significant health issue) was balanced with significant variation in priorities, opportunities, and challenges. Chinese respondents prioritized improvements in cancer-specific care and palliative care, Indian respondents favored improved cancer detection and advancing research in cancer care, and Pakistani respondents prioritized awareness of cancer and improvements in disease detection and cancer care research. For all, the most frequently cited opportunity was help in improving professional cancer education and training.--NEW SECTION--Predominantly early-career oncologists attending clinical research workshops (in China, India, and Pakistan) identified needs for increasing clinical cancer research, professional education, and public awareness of cancer.

Low health literacy is linked with chronic diseases prevalence and poor HRQoL. However, the interaction of health literacy with chronic disease on HRQoL remains unknown. Therefore, we examined how health literacy might modify the association between chronic disease and their HRQoL impacts.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a health survey of 913 poor rural women aged 23-57 years in Northwestern China. We assessed health literacy and HRQol using the revised Chinese Adult Health Literacy Questionnaire (R-CAHLQ) and Euroqol-5D (EQ-5D), respectively. Low health literacy was indicated by a cut-off of less than the mean of the factor score. Self-reported preexisting physician-diagnosed chronic disease and socio-demographic characteristics were also included. We fitted log-binomial regression models for each dimension of EQ-5D to examine its association with health literacy and chronic disease. We also ran linear regression models for EQ VAS scores and utility scores.--NEW SECTION--The low health literacy group was 1.33 times more likely to have a chronic disease than the high health literacy group. Pain/discomfort was the most prevalent impairment, and was more common in the low health literacy group (PR [prevalence ratio] = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.50). Chronic disease strongly predicted impairments in all the EQ-5D dimensions, with PRs ranging from 2.14 to 4.07. The association between chronic disease and pain/discomfort varied by health literacy level (health literacy × chronic disease: P = 0.033), and was less pronounced in the low health literacy group (PR = 2.15; 95% CI = 1.76, 2.64) than in the high health literacy group (PR = 3.19; 95% CI = 2.52, 4.05). The low health literacy group had lower VAS scores and utility scores, and slightly less decrement of VAS scores and utility scores associated with chronic disease.--NEW SECTION--Health literacy modified the impacts of chronic disease on HRQoL, and low health literacy group reported less HRQoL impacts related to chronic disease.

It is important to understand their existing level of awareness and support for national anti-tobacco policies. We thus aim to explore Pakistani HP students' existing attitudes towards national anti-tobacco policy and examine factors associated with lack of awareness, and support amongst them.--NEW SECTION--Secondary data analysis of the Global Health Professional Students Survey, Pakistan, 2011 was performed. Study population included 4,235 health professional students enrolled in third year of graduate level HP programs. The policy support metrics were developed using six questions from the survey. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to analyze association between HP students' awareness, and support for anti-tobacco policy (outcome variables), and various socio-demographic, attitudinal, and knowledge related factors. Descriptive statistics are reported as proportions, and results of logistic regression analysis were reported as odds ratios with 95% confidence interval.--NEW SECTION--Overall, among HP students, 10.8% (n=391) were current smokers, and 26.7% (n=965) of them were cigarette experimenters. Almost half, (46.1%, n=1666) of the HP students did not have an awareness of the official policy banning tobacco use in their school buildings and clinics; and only one in ten (9.4%, n=338) of them did not support anti-tobacco policies. Students were less likely to be aware if they had second hand exposure at home/work (OR=0.73, 95% CI (0.57-0.92), p-value <0.01). Furthermore, students who were current smokers (OR=0.21, 95% CI (0.08-0.56), or cigarette experimenters (OR=0.42, 95% CI (0.26-0.70), p-value <0.01), were least likely to support anti-tobacco policies.--NEW SECTION--We found that HP students lack awareness of anti-tobacco policies; and were less likely to support such efforts if they were current smokers. These findings may help in understanding existing perceptions of the future care givers in Pakistan. Future anti-tobacco efforts and HP training programs may target the smoking HPs to enhance their full support in this regard.",eng,"Substance abuse treatment, prevention, and policy",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We sought to understand how multinational pharmaceutical companies currently engage in CSR activities in the developing world aimed at global health impact, their motivations for doing so and how their CSR strategies are evolving.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a small-scale, exploratory study combining (i) an in-depth review of publicly available data on pharmaceutical firms' CSR with (ii) interviews of representatives from 6 firms, purposively selected, from the highest earning pharmaceutical firms worldwide.--NEW SECTION--Corporate social responsibility differed for each firm particularly with respect to how CSR is defined, organizational structures for managing CSR, current CSR activities, and motivations for CSR. Across the firms studied, the common CSR activities were: differential pharmaceutical pricing, strengthening developing country drug distribution infrastructure, mHealth initiatives, and targeted research and development. Primary factors that motivated CSR engagement were: reputational benefits, recruitment and employee satisfaction, better rankings in sustainability indices, entrance into new markets, long-term economic returns, and improved population health. In terms of CSR strategy, firms were at different points on a spectrum ranging from philanthropic donations to integrated systemic shared value business models.--NEW SECTION--CSR is of increasing importance for multinational pharmaceutical firms yet understanding of the array of CSR strategies employed and their effects is nascent. Our study points to the need to (i) develop clearer and more standardized definitions of CSR in global health (2) strengthen indices to track CSR strategies and their public health effects in developing countries and (iii) undertake more country level studies that investigate how CSR engages with national health systems.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Tuberculosis can occur in various organ systems and may present with diverse manifestations in the same system. Primary muscular tuberculosis is a very rare condition in both adults and children, and tuberculosis of various muscle groups presenting as intramuscular nodules is an even more uncommon presentation.--NEW SECTION--A 9-year-old Asian girl presented with multiple painless, gradually progressive swellings over different parts of her body for 3 months with no history of contact with tuberculosis. A physical examination was normal except for multiple swellings in her right forearm, a single swelling in her interscapular region and multiple swellings in her right calf. Ultrasonography of swellings revealed multiple nodules in the intramuscular layer. Excisional biopsies performed from two different sites revealed swellings in muscular layers and histopathology showed granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis consistent with tuberculosis. The child was started on antitubercular therapy after which the swellings resolved; she was kept on regular follow up.--NEW SECTION--Intramuscular nodules in multiple muscular sites may be the presenting symptoms of tuberculosis of the muscles.

Most of these injuries occur at home, and many are preventable. The main aim of this study was to identify key facilitators and barriers for parents in keeping their children safe from unintentional injury within their homes. A further aim was to develop an understanding of parents' perceptions of what might help them to implement injury prevention activities.--NEW SECTION--Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixty-four parents with a child aged less than five years at parent's homes. Interview data was transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis was undertaken. This was a Multi-centre qualitative study conducted in four study centres in England (Nottingham, Bristol, Norwich and Newcastle).--NEW SECTION--Barriers to injury prevention included parents' not anticipating injury risks nor the consequences of some risk-taking behaviours, a perception that some injuries were an inevitable part of child development, interrupted supervision due to distractions, maternal fatigue and the presence of older siblings, difficulties in adapting homes, unreliability and cost of safety equipment and provision of safety information later than needed in relation to child age and development. Facilitators for injury prevention included parental supervision and teaching children about injury risks. This included parents' allowing children to learn about injury risks through controlled risk taking, using ""safety rules"" and supervising children to ensure that safety rules were adhered to. Adapting the home by installing safety equipment or removing hazards were also key facilitators. Some parents felt that learning about injury events through other parents' experiences may help parents anticipate injury risks.--NEW SECTION--There are a range of barriers to, and facilitators for parents undertaking injury prevention that would be addressable during the design of home safety interventions. Addressing these in future studies may increase the effectiveness of interventions.",eng,BMC public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

While much has been written about the ethics and curricular guidelines related to such endeavors, scant attention has been paid to the attitudes with which trainees and clinicians enter into or return from them. In this essay the authors explore how attitudes contribute to the success or failure of international service-learning trips.--NEW SECTION--The authors submit that the attitudes with which visiting health professionals approach international service-learning trips are much more critical to the success of these experiences than their demonstrated knowledge base or specialized skill sets. They list five attitudes that can aid those participating in international service-learning trips. They list five troubling attitudes that, while common, those participating in international service-learning trips can learn to recognize and avoid. They suggest five strategies key to learning respectful attitudes that can foster success in such cross-cultural activities. Lastly, the authors review several concepts related to attitude development in short or long-term global health work.--NEW SECTION--The attitudes with which visiting health professionals approach international service-learning activities can be important components of the success or failure of the experiences. Through thoughtful consideration of attitudes and approaches, participants on such trips can build a framework for rich and rewarding experiences in global medicine and global health.",eng,BMC medical education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Categories were applied to HIV-positive respondents with controlled (CI; n=672) and uncontrolled infection (UI; n=596), HIV-negative (n=4,734) and untested respondents (n=663). Consistent condom use was reported by 22% (n=148) of HIV-positive-CI respondents, 13% (n=79) of HIV-positives UI, 55% (2,603) of HIV-negatives, and 50% (n=329) of untested (p<0.001).

Although it may seem intuitive that participation in GHEs develops CanMEDS competencies, this has not been studied in depth in surgery. The purpose of this study is (1) to explore if and how otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS) resident participation in GHEs facilitates the development of CanMEDS competencies and (2) to develop an OHNS GHE tool to facilitate the integration of CanMEDS into GHE participation and evaluation.--NEW SECTION--An online survey explored the GHEs of current and past OHNS residents in Canada. Based on the data collected and a literature review, a foundational tool was then created to (1) enable OHNS residents to structure their GHEs into CanMEDS-related learning objectives and (2) enable OHNS program directors to more effectively evaluate residents' GHEs with respect to CanMEDS competencies.--NEW SECTION--Participants' GHEs varied widely. These experiences often contributed informally to the development of several CanMEDS competencies. However, few residents had concrete objectives, rarely were CanMEDS roles clearly incorporated, and most residents were not formally evaluated during their experience. Residents felt they achieved greater learning when predeparture objectives and postexperience reflections were integrated into their GHEs.--NEW SECTION--Although GHEs vary widely, they can serve as valuable forums for developing CanMEDS competencies among participating residents. Without clear objectives that adhere to the CanMEDS framework or formal assessment methods however, residents in GHEs risk becoming medical tourists. The use of an objective and evaluation tool may facilitate the creation of predeparture learning objectives, encourage self-reflection on their GHE, and better enable program directors to evaluate residents participating in GHEs.",eng,Journal of surgical education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Shanghai has the highest GDP and largest metropolitan population in China. To understand the impact of influenza B in Shanghai in terms of age-related incidence and relative prevalence compared with other subtypes, we conducted this retrospective epidemiological study of influenza B in the 2009-2014 seasons. A total of 71 354 outpatients with influenza-like illness were included, and both lineages of influenza B and subtypes of influenza A were identified using real-time RT-PCR. The antigenic characteristics of influenza B isolates were analysed by sequencing and reciprocal haemagglutinin inhibition assay. On average, 33.45% of influenza strains were influenza B, and 40.20% of strains isolated from children were influenza B. The incidence of influenza B was highest (12.52 per 100 people with influenza-like illness) in children ages 6-17 years and usually peaked in this age group at the early stage of an influenza B epidemic. Overall, both matched and mismatched influenza B strains co-circulated in Shanghai annually, and 44.57% of the circulating influenza B belonged to the opposite lineage of the vaccine strains. We concluded that influenza B has caused a substantial impact in Shanghai and that school-aged children play a key role in the transmission of influenza B. Hence, it may be beneficial to prioritize influenza vaccination for school-aged children to mitigate the outbreaks of influenza B.",eng,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Data were extracted and synthesised across three themes as follows: feasibility of use of mobile tools by FHWs, training required for adoption of mobile tools and effectiveness of such interventions.--NEW SECTION--Forty-two studies were included in this review. With adequate training, FHWs were able to use mobile phones to enhance various aspects of their work activities. Training of FHWs to use mobile phones for healthcare delivery ranged from a few hours to about 1 week. Five key thematic areas for the use of mobile phones by FHWs were identified as follows: data collection and reporting, training and decision support, emergency referrals, work planning through alerts and reminders, and improved supervision of and communication between healthcare workers. Findings suggest that mobile based data collection improves promptness of data collection, reduces error rates and improves data completeness. Two methodologically robust studies suggest that regular access to health information via SMS or mobile-based decision-support systems may improve the adherence of the FHWs to treatment algorithms. The evidence on the effectiveness of the other approaches was largely descriptive and inconclusive.--NEW SECTION--Use of mHealth strategies by FHWs might offer some promising approaches to improving healthcare delivery; however, the evidence on the effectiveness of such strategies on healthcare outcomes is insufficient.",eng,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2015

The number of studies on gender differences in response to this surgery has increased, and the connection between gender and symptoms and patient outcomes has generated increasing interest. Nevertheless, little is known about the gender differences in quality of life and cancer-related symptoms. We examined gender differences and quality of life changes over a 1-year period among patients with lower rectal cancer who were treated with sphincter-saving surgery.--NEW SECTION--Patients (men = 42; women = 33) completed a self-administered questionnaire on their quality of life and related factors before surgery and 1, 6, and 12 months afterwards.

25880569,10.1186/s12992-015-0093-0,The ecosystem approach to health is a promising strategy in international development: lessons from Japan and Laos.,"An ecological perspective was prominently present in the health promotion movement in the 1980s, but this seems to have faded. The burden of disease the developing world is facing cannot be addressed solely by reductionist approaches. Holistic approaches are called for that recognize the fundamentally interdependent nature of health and other societal, developmental, and ecosystem related factors in human communities. An ecosystem approach to human health (ecohealth) provides a good starting point to explore these interdependencies.--NEW SECTION--Development assistance is often based on the assumption that developed countries can serve as models for developing ones. Japan has provided lavish assistance to Laos for example, much of it going to the development of transport networks. However, there is little sign that there is an awareness of the potentially negative environmental and health impacts of this assistance. We argue that the health consequences of environmental degradation are not always understood, and that developing countries need to consider these issues. The ecohealth approach is useful when exploring this issue. We highlight three implications of the ecohealth approach: (1) The WHO definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being emphasized that health is more than the absence of disease. However, because this approach may involve an unattainable goal, we suggest that health should be defined in the ecosystem context, and the goal should be to attain acceptable and sustainable levels of health through enabling people to realize decent livelihoods, and to pursue their life purpose; (2) The increasing interconnectedness of ecosystems in a globalizing world requires an ethical approach that considers human responsibility for the global biosphere. Here, ecohealth could be a countervailing force to our excessive concentration on economy and technology; and (3) If ecohealth is to become a positive agent of change in the global health promotion movement, it will have to find a secure place in the educational curriculum.

25880158,10.1002/biot.201400392,Next generation vaccines and vectors: Designing downstream processes for recombinant protein-based virus-like particles.,"In recent years, the development of novel recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) has been generating new perspectives for the prevention of untreated and arising infectious diseases. However, cost-reduction and acceleration of manufacturing processes for VLP-based vaccines or vectors are key challenges for the global health system. In particular, the design of rapid and cost-efficient purification processes is a critical bottleneck. In this review, we describe and evaluate new concepts, development strategies and unit operations for the downstream processing of VLPs. A special focus is placed on purity requirements and current trends, as well as chances and limitations of novel technologies. The discussed methods and case studies demonstrate the advances and remaining challenges in both rational process development and purification tools for large biomolecules. The potential of a new era of VLP-based products is highlighted by the progress of various VLPs in clinical phases.",eng,Biotechnology journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25878109,10.1128/JVI.00636-15,Dynasore disrupts trafficking of herpes simplex virus proteins.,"Dynasore, a small-molecule inhibitor of the GTPase activity of dynamin, inhibits the entry of several viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), but its impact on other steps in the viral life cycle has not been delineated. The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that dynamin is required for viral protein trafficking and thus has pleiotropic inhibitory effects on HSV infection. Dynasore inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection of human epithelial and neuronal cells, including primary genital tract cells and human fetal neurons and astrocytes. Similar results were obtained when cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing dominant negative dynamin. Kinetic studies demonstrated that dynasore reduced the number of viral capsids reaching the nuclear pore if added at the time of viral entry and that, when added as late as 8 h postentry, dynasore blocked the transport of newly synthesized viral proteins from the nucleus to the cytosol. Proximity ligation assays demonstrated that treatment with dynasore prevented the colocalization of VP5 and dynamin. This resulted in a reduction in the number of viral capsids isolated from sucrose gradients. Fewer capsids were observed by electron microscopy in dynasore-treated cells than in control-treated cells. There were also reductions in infectious progeny released into culture supernatants and in cell-to-cell spread. Together, these findings suggest that targeting dynamin-HSV interactions may provide a new strategy for HSV treatment and prevention.--NEW SECTION--HSV infections remain a global health problem associated with significant morbidity, particularly in neonates and immunocompromised hosts, highlighting the need for novel approaches to treatment and prevention. The current studies indicate that dynamin plays a role in multiple steps in the viral life cycle and provides a new target for antiviral therapy. Dynasore, a small-molecule inhibitor of dynamin, has pleiotropic effects on HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection and impedes viral entry, trafficking of viral proteins, and capsid formation.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25878051,10.1177/2211068215581349,Development and Applications of Portable Biosensors.,"The significance of microfluidics-based and microelectromechanical systems-based biosensors has been widely acknowledged, and many reviews have explored their potential applications in clinical diagnostics, personalized medicine, global health, drug discovery, food safety, and forensics. Because health care costs are increasing, there is an increasing need to remotely monitor the health condition of patients by point-of-care-testing. The demand for biosensors for detection of biological warfare agents has increased, and research is focused on ways of producing small portable devices that would allow fast, accurate, and on-site detection. In the past decade, the demand for rapid and accurate on-site detection of plant disease diagnosis has increased due to emerging pathogens with resistance to pesticides, increased human mobility, and regulations limiting the application of toxic chemicals to prevent spread of diseases. The portability of biosensors for on-site diagnosis is limited due to various issues, including sample preparation techniques, fluid-handling techniques, the limited lifetime of biological reagents, device packaging, integrating electronics for data collection/analysis, and the requirement of external accessories and power. Many microfluidic, electronic, and biological design strategies, such as handling liquids in biosensors without pumps/valves, the application of droplet-based microfluidics, paper-based microfluidic devices, and wireless networking capabilities for data transmission, are being explored.",eng,Journal of laboratory automation,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, no suitable quality of life (QoL) measures exist for use in Nepal. We aimed to amend and translate the Glasgow Health Status Inventory (GHSI), assessing QoL at any given time, and the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), assessing change in QoL following intervention, into Nepali and to assess the impact of ear disease and effect of surgery on QoL.--NEW SECTION--The GHSI and GBI were translated into Nepali and independently verified. The GHSI was administered by interview to patients before surgery, and the GBI was administered 6 months after surgery. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for hypothesis testing.--NEW SECTION--The GHSI was administered to 242 patients. In total, 205 had chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) without cholesteatoma and 37 had cholesteatoma. The mean GHSI score was 47.9. There was no significant difference in GHSI scores between patients with CSOM without cholesteatoma and those with cholesteatoma. The GBI was administered to 161 patients, 73 of whom had also been in the GHSI group. In total, 130 had CSOM without cholesteatoma, 31 had cholesteatoma. The mean GBI score was +38.4 with no significant difference between disease groups.--NEW SECTION--Ear disease in Nepal is associated with reduced QoL, and surgical intervention is associated with improved QoL. There is no difference in QoL or benefit following surgery for CSOM between patients with or without cholesteatoma. There are few QoL measures suitable for the developing world. It is essential to invest in these measures to guide health interventions.",eng,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Though the evidence from published literature grows to support a cause-and-effect association of SSBs with obesity and other diseases, little is known on the effectiveness that strategies alone or as part of multi-component programmes have had to influence this particular dietary behaviour across all ages. Therefore, this review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effect that interventions have had to decrease their consumption or increase water intake in children and adults so as to guide the design of future programmes and inform policy making.--NEW SECTION--Included studies in this review will be randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental interventions (with a control group) that have reported baseline and post-intervention intakes of SSBs or water and that have been published from 1990 in any language. A thorough search will be performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane's central register of controlled trials, and the Global Health Library. Two independent reviewers will conduct initial screening of potentially included articles and will later extract data to analyse domains of intervention design and delivery (with emphasis on behaviour change techniques used as rationale), as well as results in changes on consumption patterns and behavioural determinants. Internal and external validity of each study will also be appraised. A meta-analysis will be performed if a sufficient number of studies are available, and if not, a narrative review will be conducted instead.--NEW SECTION--The results from this review aim to strengthen public health initiatives tackling obesity through improvements in non-alcoholic drinking patterns. As a subject of growing attention globally, this review will help determine which strategies available are the most effective in different contexts.

Developing safe and effective respiratory mucosal TB vaccines represents a unique challenge. Over the past decade or so, the human serotype 5 adenovirus (AdHu5)-based TB vaccine has emerged as one of the most promising candidates based on a plethora of preclinical and early clinical studies. However, anti-AdHu5 immunity widely present in the lung of humans poses a serious gap and limitation to its real-world applications. In this study we have developed a novel chimpanzee adenovirus 68 (AdCh68)-vectored TB vaccine amenable to the respiratory route of vaccination. We have evaluated AdCh68-based TB vaccine for its safety, T-cell immunogenicity, and protective efficacy in relevant animal models of human pulmonary TB with or without parenteral BCG priming. We have also compared AdCh68-based TB vaccine with its AdHu5 counterpart in both naive animals and those with preexisting anti-AdHu5 immunity in the lung. We provide compelling evidence that AdCh68-based TB vaccine is not only safe when delivered to the respiratory tract but, importantly, is also superior to its AdHu5 counterpart in induction of T-cell responses and immune protection, and limiting lung immunopathology in the presence of preexisting anti-AdHu5 immunity in the lung. Our findings thus suggest AdCh68-based TB vaccine to be an ideal candidate for respiratory mucosal immunization, endorsing its further clinical development in humans.",eng,Mucosal immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1), a ubiquitously expressed pro-fibrotic cytokine plays a pivotal role in mediating the hypertrophic and fibrotic manifestations of DN. The present study is aimed to study the association of TGF-β1 g.869T>C (rs1800470) and g.-509C>T (rs1800469) polymorphism in T2D and end stage renal disease (ESRD) cases from the two geographically and ethnically different populations from North India. A total of 1313 samples comprising 776 samples from Punjab (204 with ESRD, 257 without ESRD, and 315 healthy controls) and 537 samples from Jammu and Kashmir (150 with ESRD, 187 without ESRD, and 200 controls) were genotyped for TGF-β1 (rs1800470 and rs1800469) using ARMS-PCR. The CC genotype of rs1800470 increased ESRD risk by 3.1-4.5-fold in both populations. However, for rs1800469, the TT genotype provided 5.5-fold risk towards ESRD cases from Jammu and Kashmir and no risk for the cases from Punjab. The haplotype C-T conferred nearly a 2-3-fold risk towards T2D and ESRD and diplotype CC-CT conferred a 4-fold risk towards ESRD. Our results conclude that TGF-β1 (rs1800470) may increase the risk of both ESRD and T2D in both populations, but TGF-β1 (rs1800469) provided risk for only ESRD in the population of Jammu and Kashmir. The present study is one of the large sample sized genetic association studies of T2D and ESRD from Indian population and adds to the scholarship on global health omics.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Molecular diagnostics, however, have been difficult to implement in smartphones. We herein report a diffraction-based approach that enables molecular and cellular diagnostics. The D3 (digital diffraction diagnosis) system uses microbeads to generate unique diffraction patterns which can be acquired by smartphones and processed by a remote server. We applied the D3 platform to screen for precancerous or cancerous cells in cervical specimens and to detect human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA. The D3 assay generated readouts within 45 min and showed excellent agreement with gold-standard pathology or HPV testing, respectively.

Recent observational and randomized studies on vitamin D3 suggested that higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] concentrations and more vitamin D3 intake are associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, which is characterized by postprandial hyperglycemia due to inappropriate glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and its age-dependent increase of onset. However, rapid action of dietary vitamin D3 on the postprandial glucose profile has not been analyzed. When vitamin D3 is orally ingested in mice aged 12-14 weeks during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), the serum glucose profile was not changed. In contrast, when OGTT was performed with old mice aged 30-34 weeks, the glucose profile was dramatically improved with increased insulin secretion, suggesting that orally ingested vitamin D3 potentiated GSIS in aged mice. Interestingly, there was also a significant increase in plasma GLP-1 in these aged mice. Our results suggest that orally ingested dietary vitamin D3 in aged mice improves glucose metabolism as a GLP-1 enhancer.",eng,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Piperine (PIP) has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-histaminic, and immunomodulatory activities; however, its antiallergic profile has not been studied.--NEW SECTION--The objective of the study was to investigate the antiallergic potential of PIP in ova-albumin (OVA)-induced AR, mast cell degranulation (MSD), and OVA-induced paw edema.--NEW SECTION--Mice were sensitized with OVA alternately on 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13th day. They were treated with either vehicle, PIP (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, p.o.), or montelukast (10 mg/kg, p.o.) from the 14th to 20th day. On the 21st day, intranasal (OVA: 5% µl) challenge was done. Animals were evaluated for physiological parameters, biochemical parameters, spleen weight, expression of interleukins (IL-6 and IL-1β), and immunoglobin-E (IgE). Histopathology of nasal mucosa, lungs, and spleen was carried out. MSD and paw edema studies were made to understand the mechanism of action.--NEW SECTION--PIP (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) showed a significant dose-dependent protection with respect to nasal rubbing, redness of nose, and sneezing (p < 0.001) following nasal challenge. PIP dose dependently reduced histamine, NO concentration (p < 0.001), as well as reduced expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and IgE (p < 0.001) as compared with the control group. Histopathology showed inhibition of infiltration of eosinophils and hyperplasia.

25866425,10.1177/0162243914542349,The Pharmaceutical Commons: Sharing and Exclusion in Global Health Drug Development.,"In the last decade, the organization of pharmaceutical research on neglected tropical diseases has undergone transformative change. In a context of perceived ""market failure,"" the development of new medicines is increasingly handled by public-private partnerships. This shift toward hybrid organizational models depends on a particular form of exchange: the sharing of proprietary assets in general and of intellectual property rights in particular. This article explores the paradoxical role of private property in this new configuration of global health research and development. Rather than a tool to block potential competitors, proprietary assets function as a lever to attract others into risky collaborative ventures; instead of demarcating public and private domains, the sharing of property rights is used to increase the porosity of that boundary. This reimagination of the value of property is connected to the peculiar timescape of global health drug development, a promissory orientation to the future that takes its clearest form in the centrality of ""virtual"" business models and the proliferation of strategies of deferral. Drawing on the anthropological literature on inalienable possessions, we reconsider property's traditional exclusionary role and discuss the possibility that the new pharmaceutical ""commons"" proclaimed by contemporary global health partnerships might be the precursor of future enclosures.",eng,"Science, technology & human values",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Current understanding of the roles of platelet activation and thrombin generation/activity in vascular medicine has led to the development of effective antithrombotic treatments. However, in parallel with a sustained coronary and cerebral flow patency, the increasingly intensive treatment with warfarin; direct oral anticoagulant drugs [DOACs], and/or with aspirin ± clopidogrel (or ± prasugrel or ± ticagrelor), has increased the burden of GIBs related to the use of antithrombotic agents. Compelling evidence concerning this issue is accumulating to indicate that: 1) the risk of GIB related to the use of antithrombotic drugs dramatically differs in different clinical settings; and 2) the characteristics of patients (e.g., severity of illness, comorbidities) in whom it is used exert a greater impact on the risk of GIB than the type of antithrombotic agent employed. The latter concept argues for the occurrence of GIB as reflecting the presence of patients at the highest risk for adverse outcomes. The HAS-BLED score identifies subjects at risk of bleeding among those untreated and those treated with warfarin, DOACs and/or low-dose aspirin. Its use within the frame of a severity score (e.g., the CHA2DS2-VASc score in patients with atrial fibrillation) helps balance the benefits and the risks of an antithrombotic treatment and identify those patients in whom the absolute gain (vascular events prevented) outweighs the risk of GIB. Potential implications of the latter information in settings other than atrial fibrillation is thoroughly discussed.",eng,Blood reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Physiologically, obesity arises from metabolic changes in the tissues and organs of the human body; these changes result in an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, which in turn results in increased fat accumulation in adipose tissue. Such fat accumulation predisposes individuals to development of several health problems. Two different obesity treatment drugs are currently on the market; Orlistat, which reduces intestinal fat absorption via inhibiting pancreatic lipase, and Sibutramine, an anorectic or appetite suppressant. Both drugs have hazardous side effects, including increased blood pressure, dry mouth, constipation, headache, and insomnia. For this reason, a wide variety of natural materials have been explored for their obesity treatment potential.

It has been reported that a 17-kd protein translated from core-encoding genomic region can contribute to immune-mediated mechanisms associated with the development of the chronic disease. Also, Treg cells can be contributed to an inadequate response against the viruses, leading to chronic infection. Here we evaluated the ability of protein F to modulate the frequency of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+T and IL-10+T cells in patients with chronic HCV infection. F gene was amplified and cloned in the expression vector. The protein was purified and used for stimulation of PBMCs in the HCV chronic patients and the control groups. The frequency of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cell-like populations and IL-10-producing CD4+CD25+ T cells was assessed in the HCV-infected patients and in the healthy controls by flow cytometry, which showed an increase of both CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cell-like population and IL-10-producing CD4+CD25+ T cells in the HCV-infected patients positive for anti-F antibody.

Typically, MRSA strains are found associated with institutions like hospitals but recent data suggest that they are becoming more prevalent in community-acquired infections. It is thought that the incidence and prevalence of bacterial infections will continue to increase as (a) more frequent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunosuppressive medications; (b) increased number of invasive medical procedures; and (c) higher incidence of neutropenia and HIV infections. Therefore, more optimal treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), are warranted. PDT requires the interaction of light, a photosensitizing agent, and molecular oxygen to induce cytotoxic effects. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and characterized the mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by photodynamic therapy sensitized by silicon phthalocyanine (Pc) 4 on (a) methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (ATCC 25923); (b) community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) (ATCC 43300); and (c) hospital acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) (PFGE type 300). Our data include confocal image analysis, which confirmed that Pc 4 is taken up by all S. aureus strains, and viable cell recovery assay, which showed that concentrations as low as 1.0 μM Pc 4 incubated for 3 h at 37 °C followed by light at 2.0 J/cm2 can reduce cell survival by 2-5 logs. These results are encouraging, but before PDT can be utilized as an alternative treatment for eradicating resistant strains, we must first characterize the mechanism of cell death that Pc 4-based PDT employs in eliminating these pathogens.",eng,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report blood pressure (BP) responses in volunteer firefighters.--NEW SECTION--Thirty-six male, nonsmoking volunteer firefighters (27.8±9.7 years) underwent two maximal treadmill tests within 2 weeks, one in regular gym clothes and one in PPE. We found that while wearing PPE, which weighs 54.2±3.5 lbs, BP responses are exaggerated during work and in recovery. Systolic BP and heart rate were significantly (P<0.05) higher at each submaximal stage and during active recovery of the PPE test compared with the regular clothing test (15-23 mmHg and 20-34 bpm higher, respectively). Test time and VO2 max were lower in the PPE test (P<0.05).--NEW SECTION--BP responses are exaggerated while wearing full fire protective gear and remain elevated during recovery. Awareness of how firefighting activities affect BP is important; so future studies should examine how the BP increase relates to resting BP levels, to PPE weight, and to the thermal effects of the PPE.",eng,Blood pressure monitoring,Clinical Trial,2025-04-23,2015
25856222,10.3390/nu7042518,The key role of government in addressing the pandemic of micronutrient deficiency conditions in Southeast Asia.,"Micronutrient deficiency conditions are a major global public health problem. While the private sector has an important role in addressing this problem, the main responsibility lies with national governments, in cooperation with international agencies and donors. Mandatory fortification of basic foods provides a basic necessary intake for the majority and needs to be supported by provision of essential vitamin and mineral supplements for mothers and children and other high risk groups. Fortification by government mandate and regulation is essential with cooperation by private sector food manufacturers, and in the context of broader policies for poverty reduction, education and agricultural reform. Iron, iodine, vitamin A, vitamin B complex, folic acid, zinc, vitamin D and vitamin B12 are prime examples of international fortification experience achieved by proactive governmental nutrition policies. These are essential to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and their follow-up sustainable global health targets. National governmental policies for nutritional security and initiatives are essential to implement both food fortification and targeted supplementation policies to reduce the huge burden of micronutrient deficiency conditions in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world.",eng,Nutrients,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25855784,10.1093/heapro/dav022,Addressing the social determinants of inequities in physical activity and sedentary behaviours.,"Participation in both physical activity and sedentary behaviours follow a social gradient, such that those who are more advantaged are more likely to be regularly physically active, less likely to be sedentary, and less likely to experience the adverse health outcomes associated with inactive lifestyles than their less advantaged peers. The aim of this paper is to provide, in a format that will support policymakers and practitioners, an overview of the current evidence base and highlight promising approaches for promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviours equitably at each level of 'Fair Foundations: The VicHealth framework for health equity'. A rapid review was undertaken in February-April 2014. Electronic databases (Medline, PsychINFO, SportsDISCUS, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Global Health and Embase) were searched using a pre-defined search strategy and grey literature searches of websites of key relevant organizations were undertaken. The majority of included studies focussed on approaches targeting behaviour change at the individual level, with fewer focussing on daily living conditions or broader socioeconomic, political and cultural contexts. While many gaps in the evidence base remain, particularly in relation to reducing sedentary behaviour, promising approaches for promoting physical activity equitably across the three levels of the Fair Foundations framework include: community-wide approaches; support for local and state governments to develop policies and practices; neighbourhood designs (including parks) that are conducive to physical activity; investment in early childhood interventions; school programmes; peer- or group-based programmes; and targeted motivational, cognitive-behavioural, and/or mediated individual-level approaches.",eng,Health promotion international,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The iron-deficiency anaemia attributed to this disease contributes to at least 3.2 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) according to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. The current WHO-recommended control strategies rely primarily on mass drug administration or preventive chemotherapy. However, evidence is starting to accumulate confirming that preventive chemotherapy alone will not be sufficient to reduce the reinfection rates of hookworm, especially in areas of heavy transmission. The global health and research community is currently building a consensus stressing the need for the advancement of research and innovation to bridge the gaps and identify new public health interventions for diseases such as hookworm and other NTDs. This paper presents the strategies used by the Sabin Vaccine Institute Product Development Partnership (Sabin PDP) in their ongoing endeavour for the development of a human hookworm vaccine. Recent updates and the current prospects for success of an effective human hookworm vaccine, as a new technology to be linked to or combined with drug interventions, are presented.",eng,Journal of helminthology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25848734,10.17061/phrp2521516,Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in Australia--the future is prevention.,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are increasingly recognised throughout Australia as important, but preventable, disorders that result in lifelong problems with health and learning, mental health, behaviour and substance misuse. The role of this article is to highlight current efforts, which are in their infancy, to recognise and prevent FASD in Australia. A federal parliamentary inquiry into FASD (2011), development of an Australian Government 'action plan' to prevent FASD (2013) and the announcement in June 2014 of government funding to progress the plan and appoint a National FASD Technical Network have focused attention on the need for FASD prevention in Australia. Other welcome developments include the formation of Parliamentarians for the Prevention of FASD (2011), revision of guidelines regarding alcohol use in pregnancy by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC; 2009) and provision of targeted funding for FASD research by the NHMRC (2013). Initiatives by Indigenous communities to restrict access to alcohol and diagnose and prevent FASD have had a significant impact in high-risk communities. The National Organisation for FASD has an important ongoing advocacy and educational remit. Nongovernment organisations such as the Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education have contributed to prevention by developing resources to assist health professionals to advise women about the harms of alcohol use in pregnancy; encouraging men to abstain from alcohol during the pregnancy; drafting a national plan; and advocating for pregnancy warning labels on alcohol. Internationally, in 2014, a charter on prevention of FASD was published in The Lancet Global Health, and the World Health Organization released guidelines for identification and management of substance use in pregnancy. Early recognition and support for individuals with FASD is crucial to prevent adverse secondary outcomes; however, primary prevention of alcohol use in pregnancy, and hence FASD, should be our future goal. The causal pathway to drinking in pregnancy is complex and requires a broad social ecological approach. Prevention will take time, must involve all government sectors and should incorporate primary, secondary and tertiary strategies to target both the broader community and populations at high risk of alcohol use during pregnancy.",eng,Public health research & practice,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25847726,10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.014,Advances in experimental systems to study hepatitis C virus in vitro and in vivo.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a global health concern affecting over 185 million people worldwide. Chronic HCV infection causes liver fibrosis and cirrhosis and is the leading indication for liver transplantation. Recent advances in the field of direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) promise a cure for HCV in over 90% of cases that will get access to these expensive treatments. Nevertheless, the lack of a protective vaccine and likely emergence of drug-resistant viral variants call for further studies of HCV biology. With chimpanzees being for a long time the only non-human in vivo model of HCV infection, strong efforts were put into establishing in vitro experimental systems. The initial models only enabled to study specific aspects of the HCV life cycle, such as viral replication with the subgenomic replicon and entry using HCV pseudotyped particles (HCVpp). Subsequent development of protocols to grow infectious HCV particles in cell-culture (HCVcc) ignited investigations on the full cycle of HCV infection and the virus-host interactions required for virus propagation. More recently, small animal models permissive to HCV were generated that allowed in vivo testing of novel antiviral therapies as well as vaccine candidates. This review provides an overview of the currently available in vitro and in vivo experimental systems to study HCV biology. Particular emphasis is given to how these model systems furthered our understanding of virus-host interactions, viral pathogenesis and immunological responses to HCV infection, as well as drug and vaccine development.",eng,Virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This inevitably raises questions as to whether continuing growth in spending is justified, especially relative to the rising cost of cancer care. We compared cancer care across sixteen countries over time, examining changes in cancer spending and two measures of cancer mortality (amenable and excess mortality). We found that compared to low-spending health systems, high-spending systems had consistently lower cancer mortality in the period 1995-2007. Similarly, we found that the countries that increased spending the most had a 17 percent decrease in amenable mortality, compared to 8 percent in the countries with the lowest growth in cancer spending. For excess mortality, the corresponding decreases were 13 percent and 9 percent. Additionally, the rate of decrease for the countries with the highest spending growth was faster than the all-country trend. These findings are consistent with the existence of a link between higher cancer spending and lower cancer mortality.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of age and comorbidities on the quality-of-life (QoL) course before and after radical retropubic prostatectomy.--NEW SECTION--Overall, 374 patients with localized prostate cancer scheduled for radical prostatectomy were prospectively included. The QoL questionnaire QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) was completed 1 day before surgery and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after radical prostatectomy. Sexual and urinary functions were not assessed in this analysis. Subgroups according to age at diagnosis (≤60,>60 to≤70, and>70y) and comorbidities (Charlson scores≤2 and ≥3) were defined. Subgroups were compared using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, whereas changes in a group over time were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed rank test.--NEW SECTION--In all patient groups, no change was found 12 months after surgery compared with preoperative values in global health as well as functioning (role, physical, cognitive, and social). Emotional functioning improved significantly after surgery compared with preoperative functioning. Older patients (>70y) had better emotional and social functioning compared with younger patients (≤60y). The other scores were comparable between older and younger patients. Global health and physical, role, cognitive, and social functioning were independent of the number of comorbidities, although patients with a Charlson score≥3 did worse regarding fatigue and dyspnoe.--NEW SECTION--The QoL of older patients or patients with multiple comorbidities is not negatively influenced by radical prostatectomy.

We employed a four-step process in Nepal: (1) Item generation: We extracted 1081 items (grouped into 104 domains) from 56 existing tools; role-plays with Nepali therapists generated 11 additional domains. (2) Item relevance: From the 115 domains, Nepali therapists selected 49 domains of therapeutic importance and high comprehensibility. (3) Item utility: We piloted the ENACT scale through rating role-play videotapes, patient session transcripts, and live observations of primary care workers in trainings for psychological treatments and the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP).

However, seafood can be contaminated with foodborne pathogens, resulting in disease outbreaks. Because people consume large amounts of seafood, such disease outbreaks are increasing worldwide. Seafood contamination is largely due to the naturally occurring phenomenon of biofilm formation. The common seafood bacterial pathogens that form biofilms are Vibrio spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes. As these organisms pose a global health threat, recent research has focused on elucidating methods to eliminate these biofilm-forming bacteria from seafood, thereby improving food hygiene. Therefore, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation, the factors that regulate biofilm development and the role of quorum sensing and biofilm formation in the virulence of foodborne pathogens. Currently, several novel methods have been successfully developed for controlling biofilms present in seafood.

25838005,NA,A competency matrix for global oral health.,"The Lancet Commission on Education of Health Professionals for the 21(st) Century calls for enhancing health education for the needs and challenges of the 21st century to improve health status globally. To complement the Lancet report, this article makes recommendations for including core global health competencies in the education of health care professionals and specific groups of the public who are relevant to oral health in a global context in order to tackle the burden of oral diseases. Experts from various professional backgrounds developed global oral health competencies for four target groups: Group 1 was defined as dental students, residents/trainee specialists (or equivalent), and dentists; Group 2 was community health workers, dental hygienists, and dental therapists (or the equivalent); Group 3 was health professionals such as physicians, physician assistants, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists; and Group 4 was non-health professionals in the public arena such as parents, teachers, decision makers, key opinion leaders, and health and consumer advocates. Key competencies for members of each of the four target groups are presented in a matrix. The suggested competency matrix shows that many other health professions and groups in society have potentially crucial roles in the prevention, control, and management of oral diseases globally. Workforce models including a wider range of professionals working together as a team will be needed to tackle the burden of oral diseases in an integrated way in the broader context of non-communicable diseases. Further discussion and research should be conducted to validate or improve the competencies proposed here with regard to their relevance, appropriateness, and completeness.",eng,Journal of dental education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Magnetic field therapy and physical activity have been proven as beneficial interventions for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The purpose of this study was to compare the response of bone mineral content and bone mineral density (BMD) in elderly women to either low-frequency low-intensity pulsed magnetic field (LFLIPMF) or circuit weight training (CWT) on short-run basis (after 12 weeks).--NEW SECTION--Thirty elderly women, aged 60-70 years, were randomly assigned into two groups (magnetic field and CWT) (n=15 each group). The session was performed three times per week for magnetic field and CWT groups, for 12 weeks. BMD and bone mineral content of lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck, trochanter, and Ward's triangle were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of treatment.--NEW SECTION--Both magnetic field and CWT for 12 weeks in elderly women seem to yield beneficial and statistically significant increasing effect on BMD and bone mineral content (P<0.05). But magnetic field seems to have more beneficially and statistically significant effect than does CWT.--NEW SECTION--It is possible to conclude that LFLIPMF and CWT programs are effective modalities in increasing BMD but LFLIPMF is more effective in elderly women.",eng,Clinical interventions in aging,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Reliability of the questionnaire was considered acceptable if Cronbach's alpha was ≥0.70. Item convergent-discriminant validity was tested through multitrait scaling analysis. Construct validity was tested under the hypotheses that QLQ-C30 interscale correlations would have an acceptable value of ≥0.40 and as well as by known group comparisons assessing differences of patient subgroups with reference to disease stage and education level.--NEW SECTION--The mean age of the patients was 50 years (standard deviation: 10.9 years). Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.54 for the cognitive functioning scale to 0.96 for the global health quality of life (GH/QoL) scale. In multitrait scaling analysis, the strength of Spearman's correlations between an item and its own subscale was ≥0.40, with the exception of item 5 (ρ=0.22); results for item discriminant validity were satisfactory, with the exception of item 5, which showed higher correlation with other subscales than with its own physical functioning. The Spearman's interscale coefficients generally were correlated with each other. Results of known group comparisons did not show significant differences in terms of disease stage. Regarding education level, patients with high school/university education had better functional scales scores only in certain subscales compared to other subgroups; furthermore, patients with secondary school education had better GH/QoL compared to other subgroups of patients.--NEW SECTION--The EORTC QLQ-C30 (v3.0) in Albanian was found to be valid and reliable for women with breast cancer and could be considered as a starting point for further evaluation study.",eng,Patient preference and adherence,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Of particular practical concern are both 1) the need for a better understanding of the bidirectional relations between nutritional status and the development and function of the immune and inflammatory response and 2) the specific impact of the inflammatory response on the selection, use, and interpretation of nutrient biomarkers. The goal of the Inflammation and Nutritional Science for Programs/Policies and Interpretation of Research Evidence (INSPIRE) is to provide guidance for those users represented by the global food and nutrition enterprise. These include researchers (bench and clinical), clinicians providing care/treatment, those developing and evaluating programs/interventions at scale, and those responsible for generating evidence-based policy. The INSPIRE process included convening 5 thematic working groups (WGs) charged with developing summary reports around the following issues: 1) basic overview of the interactions between nutrition, immune function, and the inflammatory response; 2) examination of the evidence regarding the impact of nutrition on immune function and inflammation; 3) evaluation of the impact of inflammation and clinical conditions (acute and chronic) on nutrition; 4) examination of existing and potential new approaches to account for the impact of inflammation on biomarker interpretation and use; and 5) the presentation of new approaches to the study of these relations. Each WG was tasked with synthesizing a summary of the evidence for each of these topics and delineating the remaining gaps in our knowledge.

Great interest has been placed in recent years on vitamin D's extraskeletal actions. However, while recent data suggest a possible role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of several pathological conditions, including infectious and autoimmune diseases, the actual impact of vitamin D status on the global health of children and adolescents, other than bone, remains a subject of debate. In the meantime, pediatricians still need to evaluate the determinants of vitamin D status and consider vitamin D supplementation in children and adolescents at risk of deficiency. This review is the result of an expert meeting that was held during the congress ""Update on vitamin D and bone disease in childhood"" convened in Pisa, Italy, in May 2013.--NEW SECTION--The collaboration of the international group of experts produced this ""state of the art"" review on vitamin D in childhood and adolescence. After dealing with vitamin D status and its determinants, the review outlines the current debate on vitamin D's health benefits, concluding with a practical approach to vitamin D supplementation during childhood and adolescence.--NEW SECTION--• Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem. • Vitamin D deficiency affects not only musculoskeletal health but also a potentially wide range of acute and chronic diseases. What is New: • We reviewed the literature focusing on randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation during childhood and adolescence. • This review will help pediatricians to appreciate the clinical relevance of an adequate vitamin D status and it will provide a practical approach to vitamin D supplementation.",eng,European journal of pediatrics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We explored agency as a practical and theoretical construct through qualitative research among 20 nurses with direct or indirect experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Johannesburg. Interviews conducted from August 2013 to March 2014 generated rich descriptions from respondents in five health facilities. Nurses' self-reported IPV matched national prevalence of 24-31%. Findings revealed the way in which agency is enacted by nurses, allowing them the economic means to leave abusive partnerships, yet disabling them from agency and health promotion in their workplace. At the same time, nurses expanded agentic possibilities for patients by enabling a national response to IPV within South African health clinics - one that is largely undocumented. We posit that nurses can serve as important agentic actors in public health systems in low- and middle-income country settings by assisting patients to address IPV, even in the absence of targeted training and guidelines. To ensure the health and well-being of women experiencing IPV, nurses should be supported by the health sector to respond skilfully to patients and to safely process their own experiences of violence.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This is one of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) global health items. Four other items are used for scoring on the PROMIS global physical health scale. Because the single item is used on the majority of large national health surveys in the U.S., it is useful to construct scores that can be compared to U.S. general population norms.--NEW SECTION--To estimate the PROMIS global physical health scale score from the responses to the single excellent to poor self-rated health question for use in public health surveillance, research, and clinical assessment.--NEW SECTION--A cross-sectional survey of 21,133 individuals, weighted to be representative of the U.S. general population.--NEW SECTION--The PROMIS items were administered via a Web-based survey to 19,601 persons in a national panel and 1,532 subjects from PROMIS research sites.

A wide range of institutions are addressing the challenges, but there is limited reflection and evaluation on the various approaches, how they compare with each other, and conclusions regarding the most effective approach for particular settings. This article presents a framework for global mental health capacity building that could potentially serve as a promising or best practice in the field. The framework is the outcome of a decade of collaborative global health work at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) (Ontario, Canada). The framework is grounded in scientific evidence, relevant learning and behavioural theories and the underlying principles of health equity and human rights.--NEW SECTION--Grounded in CAMH's research, programme evaluation and practical experience in developing and implementing mental health capacity building interventions, this article presents the iterative learning process and impetus that formed the basis of the framework. A developmental evaluation (Patton M.2010. Developmental Evaluation: Applying Complexity Concepts to Enhance Innovation and Use. New York: Guilford Press.) approach was used to build the framework, as global mental health collaboration occurs in complex or uncertain environments and evolving learning systems.--NEW SECTION--A multilevel framework consists of five central components: (1) holistic health, (2) cultural and socioeconomic relevance, (3) partnerships, (4) collaborative action-based education and learning and (5) sustainability. The framework's practical application is illustrated through the presentation of three international case studies and four policy implications.

25831062,10.1089/omi.2015.0010,PTPRD is homozygously deleted and epigenetically downregulated in human hepatocellular carcinomas.,"PTPRD (protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, D) is a tumor suppressor gene, frequently inactivated through deletions or epigenetic mechanisms in several cancers with importance for global health. In this study, we provide new and functionally integrated evidence on genetic and epigenetic alterations of PTPRD gene in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Importantly, HCC is the sixth most common malignancy and the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. We used a high throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray assay (Affymetrix, 10K2.0 Assay) covering the whole genome to screen an extensive panel of HCC cell lines (N=14 in total) to detect DNA copy number changes. PTPRD expression was determined in human HCCs by Q-RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Promoter hypermethylation was assessed by combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA). DNA methyl transferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC) and/or histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostain A (TSA) were used to restore the expression. We identified homozygous deletions in Mahlavu and SNU475 cells, in the 5'UTR and coding regions, respectively. PTPRD mRNA expression was downregulated in 78.5% of cell lines and 82.6% of primary HCCs. PTPRD protein expression was also found to be lost or reduced in HCC tumor tissues. We found promoter hypermethylation in 22.2% of the paired HCC samples and restored PTPRD expression by 5-AzaC and/or TSA treatments. In conclusion, PTPRD is homozygously deleted and epigenetically downregulated in HCCs. We hypothesize PTPRD as a tumor suppressor candidate and potential cancer biomarker in human HCCs. This hypothesis is consistent with compelling evidences in other organ systems, as discussed in this article. Further functional assays in larger samples may ascertain the contribution of PTPRD to hepatocarcinogenesis in greater detail, not to forget its broader importance for diagnostic medicine and the emerging field of personalized medicine in oncology.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Future demand for critical care may outstrip supply and force clinicians to triage patients for admission. We evaluated the Simple Triage Scoring System (STSS), Ontario Health Plan for an Influenza Epidemic (OHPIP) and PaO2 /FiO2  (P/F) ratio to determine utility in predicting need for mechanical ventilation.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a retrospective case note review of patients admitted to two centres, Royal Liverpool University Hospital and Countess of Chester Hospital, during the UK influenza pandemic of 2010-11. Demand for critical care during this period forced hospitals in Cheshire and Merseyside to implement escalation policies and increase capacity. Inclusion criteria were polymerase chain reaction-confirmed H1N1 influenza and age >18 years. Exclusion criteria were no evidence of treatment for influenza, patient not admitted to hospital or the inability to locate case notes.--NEW SECTION--One hundred and one patients were included, 29 were admitted to critical care and 23 required mechanical ventilation. The P/F ratio predicted the need for mechanical ventilation with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) of 0.885 (CI 0.817-0.952). Predictive ability was not reduced when the P/F ratio had to be estimated using the Pandharipande tool. The STSS score predicted the need for mechanical ventilation [ROC AUC 0.798 (CI 0.704-0.891)]. The reverse triage component of the OHPIP tool was a poor predictor of patient outcome.--NEW SECTION--The P/F ratio was a better predictor of need for mechanical ventilation than STSS. The P/F ratio is a simple and accepted determinant of hypoxaemia and should be used if secondary triaging becomes necessary during future influenza pandemics.",eng,British journal of anaesthesia,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We here report continuous irrigation and drainage of the pancreatic remnant to be a feasible and safe alternative to total pancreatectomy.--NEW SECTION--Between 2005 and 2011, patients were analyzed, in which pancreaticojejunal anastomosis was disconnected because of grade C fistula, and catheters for continuous irrigation and drainage were placed close to the pancreatic remnant. Clinical data were monitored and quality of life was evaluated.--NEW SECTION--A total of 13 of 202 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy required reoperation due to symptomatic pancreatic fistula. Ninety-day mortality of these patients was 15.3%. Median length of stay on the intensive care unit and total length of stay was 18 d (range 3-45) and 46 d (range 33-96), respectively. Patients with early reoperation (<10 d) had significantly decreased length of stay on the intensive care unit and operation time (P < 0.05). Global health status after a median time of 22 mo (range 6-66) was nearly identical, when compared with that of a healthy control group. Mean follow-up was 44.4 mo (±27.2). Four patients (36.6 %) died during the follow-up period; two patients from tumor recurrence, one patient from pneumonia, and one patient for unknown reasons.--NEW SECTION--Treatment of pancreatic fistula by continuous irrigation and drainage of the preserved pancreatic remnant is a simple and feasible alternative to total pancreatectomy.

Extended pleurectomy and decortication results in equivalent survival yet better health-related quality of life (HRQoL).--NEW SECTION--Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma were studied for the effects of EPD on HRQoL and pulmonary function. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionaire-C30 was used to evaluate HRQoL before operation, and at 4 to 5 and 7 to 8 months postoperatively. Pulmonary function tests were measured immediately before and 5 to 7 months after the operation. Patients were compared according to World Health Organization baseline performance status (PS).--NEW SECTION--Of the 36 patients enrolled, 17 were PS 0 and 19 were PS 1 or PS 2 at baseline. Patients in groups PS 1 and PS 2 had significantly worse global health, functional, and symptoms scores. After EPD, PS 0 patients had no change in global health or function and symptoms scores except for emotional function, whereas PS 1 or PS 2 patients showed improvements at 4 to 5 months with further improvements at 7 to 8 months. The PS 0 patients demonstrated a significant decrease in forced vital capacity (p = 0.001), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (p = 0.002), total lung capacity (p = 0.0006) and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (p = 0.003) after EPD, whereas no change was observed in PS 1 and PS 2 patients.--NEW SECTION--Extended pleurectomy and decortication did not improve overall HRQoL and had a negative impact in pulmonary function in minimally symptomatic patients. In symptomatic patients, a significant improvement in HRQoL was observed after EPD, which continued at late follow-up, although the pulmonary function was not affected. As changes in HRQoL are multidimensional, the preservation of the pulmonary function may have contributed to the net benefit observed in PS 1 and PS 2 patients.",eng,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Leukocytes that are present in the blood convey valuable information about the status of the immune system. Blood transcriptomics, which consists in profiling blood transcript abundance on genome-wide scales, has gained in popularity over the past several years. Indeed, practicality and simplicity largely makes up for what this approach may lack in terms of cell population-level resolution. An extensive survey of the literature reveals increasingly widespread use across virtually all fields of medicine as well as across a number of different animal species, including model organisms but also animals of economical importance. Dissemination across such a wide range of disciplines holds the promise of adding a new perspective, breadth or context, to the considerable depth afforded by whole genome profiling of blood transcript abundance. Indeed, it is only through such contextualization that a truly global perspective will be gained from the use of systems approaches. Also discussed are opportunities that may arise for the fields of immunology and medicine from using blood transcriptomics as a common denominator for developing interactions and cooperation across fields of research that have traditionally been and largely remain compartmentalized. Finally, an argument is made for building immunology research capacity using blood transcriptomics platforms in low-resource and high-disease burden settings.",eng,Seminars in immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Among infectious diseases, tuberculosis claims approximately 2 million deaths per year worldwide. Also, agents that reduce the duration and complexity of the current therapy would have a major impact on the overall cure rate. Due to the development of resistance to conventional antibiotics there is a need for new therapeutic strategies to combat Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Subsequently, there is an urgent need for the development of new drug candidates with newer targets and alternative mechanism of action. In this perspective, pyrazole, one of the most important classes of heterocycles, has been the topic of research for thousands of researchers all over the world because of its wide spectrum of biological activities. To pave the way for future research, there is a need to collect the latest information in this promising area. In the present review, we have collated published reports on the pyrazole core to provide an insight so that its full therapeutic potential can be utilized for the treatment of tuberculosis. In this article, the possible structure-activity relationship of pyrazole analogs for designing better antituberculosis (anti-TB) agents has been discussed and is also helpful for new thoughts in the quest for rational designs of more active and less toxic pyrazole-based anti-TB drugs.",eng,Archiv der Pharmazie,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The prevalence of myopia continues to increase, particularly among highly educated groups, now exceeding 80% in some groups. In parallel with the increased prevalence of myopia, are increases in associated blinding ocular conditions including glaucoma, retinal detachment and macular degeneration, making myopia a significant global health concern. The elongation of the eye is closely related to the biomechanical properties of the sclera, which in turn are largely dependent on the composition of the scleral extracellular matrix. Therefore an understanding of the cellular and extracellular events involved in the regulation of scleral growth and remodeling during childhood and young adulthood will provide future avenues for the treatment of myopia and its associated ocular complications.",eng,Experimental eye research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

It is believed that an exaggerated inflammatory response to cigarette smoke causes progressive airflow limitation. This inflammation, where macrophages, neutrophils and T lymphocytes are prominent, leads to oxidative stress, emphysema, small airway fibrosis and mucus hypersecretion. Much of the disease burden and health care utilisation in COPD is associated with the management of its comorbidities and infectious (viral and bacterial) exacerbations (AECOPD). Comorbidities, defined as other chronic medical conditions, in particular skeletal muscle wasting and cardiovascular disease markedly impact on disease morbidity, progression and mortality. The mechanisms and mediators underlying COPD and its comorbidities are poorly understood and current COPD therapy is relatively ineffective. Thus, there is an obvious need for new therapies that can prevent the induction and progression of COPD and effectively treat AECOPD and comorbidities of COPD. Given that access to COPD patients can be difficult and that clinical samples often represent a ""snapshot"" at a particular time in the disease process, many researchers have used animal modelling systems to explore the mechanisms underlying COPD, AECOPD and comorbidities of COPD with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets. This review highlights the mouse models used to define the cellular, molecular and pathological consequences of cigarette smoke exposure and the recent advances in modelling infectious exacerbations and comorbidities of COPD.",eng,European journal of pharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25816792,10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.03.027,The changing donor landscape of health sector aid to Vietnam: a qualitative case study.,"The study objective was to identify how donors and government agencies in Vietnam responded to donor proliferation in health sector aid between 1995 and 2012. Interviews were conducted with key informants from donor agencies, central government, and civil society in Hanoi in 2012 (n = 34 interviews), identified through OECD Creditor Reporting System data, internet research, and snowball sampling. Interview transcripts were coded for key themes using the constant comparative method. Documentary materials were used in triangulation and validation of key informant accounts. The study identified a timeline of key events and key themes. The number of donors providing health sector aid to Vietnam increased sharply during the late 1990s and early 2000s, then leveled off and declined between 2008 and 2012. Reasons for donor entry included Vietnam's health needs, perceptions of health as less politically sensitive, and donor interests in facilitating market access. Reasons for donor withdrawal included Vietnam's achievement of middle-income status, the global financial crisis, and donors' shifting global priorities. Key themes included high competition among donors, strategic actions by government to increase its control over aid, and the multiplicity of government units involved with health sector aid. The study concludes that central government and donor agencies in Vietnam responded to donor proliferation in health sector aid by endorsing aid effectiveness policies but implementing these policies inconsistently in practice. Whereas previous literature has emphasized donor proliferation's transaction costs, this study finds that the benefits of a large number of less coordinated donors may outweigh the increased administrative costs under certain conditions. In Vietnam, these conditions included relatively high capacity within government, low government dependence on aid, and government interest in receiving diverse donor recommendations. Vietnam's experience of donor proliferation followed by donor withdrawal illustrates a trajectory that other countries may experience as they transition from low-to middle-income status.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Evidence is accumulating that this immaturity is causally related to the pathogenesis of undernutrition and its lingering sequelae. Preclinical models in which human gut communities are replicated in gnotobiotic mice have provided an opportunity to identify and predict the effects of different dietary ingredients on microbiota structure, expressed functions, and host biology. This capacity sets the stage for proof-of-concept tests designed to deliberately shape the developmental trajectory and configurations of microbiota in children representing different geographies, cultural traditions, and states of health.

To reduce side effects associated with systemic drug distribution and improve drug concentration at the target site, stable therapeutic nanocarriers (NCs) were prepared and evaluated for efficacy in vitro in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages. Rifampicin (RIF), a current, broad-spectrum antibiotic used in TB therapy, was conjugated by degradable ester bonds to form hydrophobic prodrugs. NCs encapsulating various ratios of nonconjugated RIF and the prodrugs showed the potential ability to rapidly deliver and knockdown intracellular M. tuberculosis by nonconjugated RIF and to obtain sustained release of RIF by hydrolysis of the RIF prodrug. NCs of the novel antibiotic SQ641 and a combination NC with cyclosporine A were formed by flash nanoprecipitation. Delivery of SQ641 in NC form resulted in significantly improved activity compared to that of the free drug against intracellular M. tuberculosis. A NC formulation with a three-compound combination of SQ641, cyclosporine A, and vitamin E inhibited intracellular replication of M. tuberculosis significantly better than SQ641 alone or isoniazid, a current first-line anti-TB drug.",eng,Molecular pharmaceutics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The bacterium responsible for this disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), has successfully survived within hostile host environments, adapting to immune defence mechanisms, for centuries. This has resulted in a disease that is challenging to treat, requiring lengthy chemotherapy with multi-drug regimens. One explanation for this difficulty in eliminating M.tb bacilli in vivo is the disparate action of antimicrobials on heterogeneous populations of M.tb, where mycobacterial physiological state may influence drug efficacy. In order to develop improved drug combinations that effectively target diverse mycobacterial phenotypes, it is important to understand how such subpopulations of M.tb are formed during human infection.

The alarming rise of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent of TB, has made it exceedingly difficult to control the disease with the existing portfolio of anti-TB chemotherapy. The development of effective drugs with novel mechanism(s) of action is thus of paramount importance to tackle drug resistance. The development of novel chemical entities requires more than 10 years of research, requiring high-risk investment to become commercially available. Repurposing pre-existing drugs offers a solution to circumvent this mammoth investment in time and funds. In this context, several drugs with known safety and toxicity profiles have been evaluated against the TB pathogen and found to be efficacious against its different physiological states. As the endogenous targets of these drugs in the TB bacillus are most likely to be novel, there is minimal chance of cross-resistance with front-line anti-TB drugs. Also, reports that some of these drugs may potentially have multiple targets means that the possibility of the development of resistance against them is minimal. Thus repurposing existing molecules offers immense promise to tackle extensively drug-resistant TB infections.",eng,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The availability of effective antimicrobial treatment for both HIV-1 (in the form of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)) and TB (with antimycobacterial agents) has the potential to mitigate the associated morbidity and mortality. However, the use of both HAART and antimycobacterial therapy is associated with the development of inflammatory paradoxical syndromes after commencement of therapy. These include paradoxical reactions (PR) and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes (IRIS), conditions that complicate mycobacterial disease in HIV seronegative and seropositive individuals. Here, we discuss case definitions for PR and IRIS, and explore how advances in identifying the risk factors and immunopathogenesis of these conditions informs our understanding of their shared underlying pathogenesis. We propose that both PR and IRIS are characterized by the triggering of exaggerated inflammation in a setting of immunocompromise and antigen loading, via the reversal of immunosuppression by HAART and/or antimycobacterials. Further understanding of the molecular basis of this pathogenesis may pave the way for effective immunotherapies for the treatment of PR and IRIS.",eng,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The Shade Tree Clinic Early Pregnancy Program, jointly operated by university medical and nursing programs, functions as an ongoing access-to-care portal for pregnant women without health insurance. The clinic is run by medical students and nurse-midwifery students and uses a service-based learning model that allows students to work and learn in supervised, interprofessional teams while providing evidence-based prenatal care.--NEW SECTION--All data reported in this paper were obtained from a retrospective chart review of women served by the prenatal clinic. These data are descriptive in nature, and include the patient demographics and services provided by the clinic to 152 women between the years of 2010-2013.--NEW SECTION--During this time period, the clinic served a demographically diverse clientele. Approximately half lacked documentation of legal immigration status. The majority of women seeking care were in their first trimester of pregnancy and had previously given birth. Several women had medical or obstetric complications that required timely referral to specialist care; and many women received treatment for infection and other primary care concerns.--NEW SECTION--Shade Tree Clinic provides the basic components of prenatal care and assists women with other medical needs. Women also receive help when applying for and accessing public maternity insurance, and the clinic facilitates entry to any necessary specialist care while that insurance is processed. In many cases, necessary and time-sensitive care would be delayed if Shade Tree Clinic's prenatal services were not available.

25805727,10.1128/mBio.00235-15,Malaria parasites produce volatile mosquito attractants.,"The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains a nonphotosynthetic plastid organelle that possesses plant-like metabolic pathways. Plants use the plastidial isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway to produce volatile odorants, known as terpenes. In this work, we describe the volatile chemical profile of cultured malaria parasites. Among the identified compounds are several plant-like terpenes and terpene derivatives, including known mosquito attractants. We establish the molecular identity of the odorant receptors of the malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae, which responds to these compounds. The malaria parasite produces volatile signals that are recognized by mosquitoes and may thereby mediate host attraction and facilitate transmission.--NEW SECTION--Malaria is a key global health concern. Mosquitoes that transmit malaria are more attracted to malaria parasite-infected mammalian hosts. These studies aimed to understand the chemical signals produced by malaria parasites; such an understanding may lead to new transmission-blocking strategies or noninvasive malaria diagnostics.",eng,mBio,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Trends in per capita food consumption during 1960-2010 were investigated using data from the Swedish Board of Agriculture. Food items were classified as group 1 (unprocessed/minimally processed), group 2 (processed culinary ingredients) or group 3 (3·1, processed food products; and 3·2, ultra-processed products). Obesity prevalence data were pooled from the peer-reviewed literature, Statistics Sweden and the WHO Global Health Observatory.--NEW SECTION--Nationwide analysis in Sweden, 1960-2010.--NEW SECTION--Swedish nationals aged 18 years and older.--NEW SECTION--During the study period consumption of group 1 foods (minimal processing) decreased by 2 %, while consumption of group 2 foods (processed ingredients) decreased by 34 %. Consumption of group 3·1 foods (processed food products) increased by 116 % and group 3·2 foods (ultra-processed products) increased by 142 %. Among ultra-processed products, there were particularly large increases in soda (315 %; 22 v. 92 litres/capita per annum) and snack foods such as crisps and candies (367 %; 7 v. 34 kg/capita per annum). In parallel to these changes in ultra-processed products, rates of adult obesity increased from 5 % in 1980 to over 11 % in 2010.--NEW SECTION--The consumption of ultra-processed products (i.e. foods with low nutritional value but high energy density) has increased dramatically in Sweden since 1960, which mirrors the increased prevalence of obesity. Future research should clarify the potential causal role of ultra-processed products in weight gain and obesity.",eng,Public health nutrition,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We also review an intraocular implanted diagnostic system for glaucoma that relies on imaging the location of a fluid meniscus in a microchannel to readout pressure within the eye. Developments in low-cost and highly functional consumer electronic systems (e.g. smartphones in both highlighted works) has led to a continuing trend to incorporate such technologies with microfluidic fluid handling capabilities to achieve complete diagnostic solutions. We conclude with another implanted microdevice that delivers drug locally to tumors through electroosmotic flow and electromigration of charged drug species, which allows high drug concentrations near a tumor or resected tumor site while preventing high systemic levels associated with significant side-effects. The maturity of microsystem components are now allowing integration into fully functional systems that are poised to reach the clinic in a variety of forms - diagnostic to therapeutic.",eng,Lab on a chip,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Considering context and the interplay of individual, organizational, and societal influences on the experience of volunteers, this paper addresses three questions: What do grassroots volunteers contribute? What organizational processes promote volunteer engagement? What are the positive and negative consequences of volunteering? Eighteen members and staff of the Tanzanian HIV and AIDS NGO, KIWAKKUKI, were selected from 6000+ women volunteers to be interviewed. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes. Within KIWAKKUKI, volunteers contributed time and local knowledge, leading to an indigenous educational approach building on local norms and customs. Volunteers' engagement was motivated by the desire to support family members, reverse stigma, and work/socialize with other women. Benefits to volunteers included skills acquisition and community recognition; yet some volunteers also reported negative experiences including burnout, conferred stigma, and domestic violence. Positive organizational processes built on cultural practices such as collective decision-making and singing. The findings point to important considerations about context, including the synergistic effect training can have on local traditions of caring, complications of gender inequity, and how community health planning processes may need to be modified in extremely poor settings. This research also suggests good utility of the research framework (the Bergen Model of Collaborative Functioning) that was used to analyze volunteer engagement for service delivery in sub-Saharan contexts.",eng,Global health promotion,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Innate first-line-defense mechanisms such as production of mucus and antimicrobial peptides by intestinal epithelial cells are of utmost importance for host control of gastrointestinal infections. For the first time, we directly demonstrate a critical role for Stat3 activation in intestinal epithelial cells upon infection of mice with Citrobacter rodentium - a murine pathogen that mimics human infections with attaching and effacing Escherichia coli. C. rodentium induced transcription of IL-6 and IL-22 in gut samples of mice and was associated with activation of the transcription factor Stat3 in intestinal epithelial cells. C. rodentium infection induced expression of several antimicrobial peptides such as RegIIIγ and Pla2g2a in the intestine which was critically dependent on Stat3 activation. Consequently, mice with specific deletion of Stat3 in intestinal epithelial cells showed increased susceptibility to C. rodentium infection as indicated by high bacterial load, severe gut inflammation, pronounced intestinal epithelial cell death and dissemination of bacteria to distant organs. Together, our data implicate an essential role for Stat3 activation in intestinal epithelial cells during C. rodentium infection. Stat3 concerts the host response to bacterial infection by controlling bacterial growth and suppression of apoptosis to maintain intestinal epithelial barrier function.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Little is known regarding the barriers to and drivers of orthopaedic surgery research in such resource-poor settings, the knowledge of which would help direct specific interventions for increasing research capacity and help surgeons from high-income countries support the efforts of our colleagues in low- and middle-income countries.--NEW SECTION--We sought to identify through surveying academic orthopaedic surgeons in East Africa: (1) barriers impeding research, (2) factors that support or drive research, and (3) factors that were identified by some surgeons as barriers and others as drivers (what we term barrier-driver overlap) as they considered the production of clinical research in resource-poor environments.--NEW SECTION--Semistructured interviews were conducted with 21 orthopaedic surgeon faculty members at four academic medical centers in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Qualitative content analysis of the interviews was conducted using methods based in grounded theory. Grounded theory begins with qualitative data, such as interview transcripts, and analyzes the data for repeated ideas or concepts which then are coded and grouped into categories which allow for identification of subjects or problems that may not have been apparent previously to the interviewer.--NEW SECTION--We identified and quantified 19 barriers to and 21 drivers of orthopaedic surgery research (mentioned n = 1688 and n = 1729, respectively). Resource, research process, and institutional domains were identified to categorize the barriers (n = 7, n = 5, n = 7, respectively) and drivers (n = 7, n = 8, n = 6, respectively). Resource barriers (46%) were discussed more often by interview subjects compared with the research process (26%) and institutional barriers (28%). Drivers of research discussed at least once were proportionally similar across the three domains. Some themes such as research ethics boards, technology, and literature access occurred with similar frequency as barriers to and drivers of orthopaedic surgery research.--NEW SECTION--The barriers we identified most often among East African academic orthopaedic faculty members focused on resources to accomplish research, followed by institutional barriers, and method or process barriers. Drivers to be fostered included a desire to effect change, collaboration with colleagues, and mentorship opportunities.

In this work, a simple deterministic two-patch model is introduced to assess the impact of dengue transmission dynamics in heterogeneous environments. The two-patch system models the movement (e.g. urban versus rural areas residence times) of individuals between and within patches/environments using residence-time matrices with entries that budget within and between host patch relative residence times, under the assumption that only the human budgets their residence time across regions. Three scenarios are considered: (i) resident hosts in Patch i visit patch j, where i≠j but not the other way around, a scenario referred to as unidirectional motion; (ii) symmetric bi-directional motion; and (iii) asymmetric bi-directional motion. Optimal control theory is used to identify and evaluate patch-specific control measures aimed at reducing dengue prevalence in humans and vectors at a minimal cost. Optimal policies are computed under different residence-matrix configurations mentioned above as well as transmissibility scenarios characterized by the magnitude of the basic reproduction number. Optimal patch-specific polices can ameliorate the impact of epidemic outbreaks substantially when the basic reproduction number is moderate. The final patch-specific epidemic size variation increases as the residence time matrix moves away from the symmetric case (asymmetry). As expected, the patch where individuals spend most of their time or in the patch where transmissibility is higher tend to support larger patch-specific final epidemic sizes. Hence, focusing on intervention that target areas where individuals spend ""most"" time or where transmissibility is higher turn out to be optimal. Therefore, reducing traffic is likely to take a host-vector system into the world of manageable outbreaks.",eng,Journal of theoretical biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25788710,10.1124/jpet.115.223289,"Arsenic, reactive oxygen, and endothelial dysfunction.","Human exposure to drinking water contaminated with arsenic is a serious global health concern and predisposes to cardiovascular disease states, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and microvascular disease. The most sensitive target of arsenic toxicity in the vasculature is the endothelium, and incubation of these cells with low concentrations of arsenite, a naturally occurring and highly toxic inorganic form of arsenic, rapidly induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation via activation of a specific NADPH oxidase (Nox2). Arsenite also induces ROS accumulation in vascular smooth muscle cells, but this is relatively delayed because, depending on the vessel from which they originate, these cells often lack Nox2 and/or its essential regulatory cytosolic subunits. The net effect of such activity is attenuation of endothelium-dependent conduit artery dilation via superoxide anion-mediated scavenging of nitric oxide (NO) and inhibition and downregulation of endothelial NO synthase, events that are temporally matched to the accumulation of oxidants across the vessel wall. By contrast, ROS induced by the more toxic organic trivalent arsenic metabolites (monomethylarsonous and dimethylarsinous acids) may originate from sources other than Nox2. As such, the mechanisms through which vascular oxidative stress develops in vivo under continuous exposure to all three of these potent arsenicals are unknown. This review is a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms that mediate arsenic effects associated with Nox2 activation, ROS activity, and endothelial dysfunction, and also considers future avenues of research into what is a relatively poorly understood topic with major implications for human health.",eng,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25788374,10.1007/s12072-014-9571-3,How to achieve immune control in chronic hepatitis B?,"Chronic hepatitis B infection remains a major global health problem despite the existence of an effective vaccine. The current treatment options are either nucleos(t)ide analog therapy, which inhibits viral replication, or peginterferon-α, which has mainly immunomodulatory effects. However, treatment-induced HBeAg seroconversion with suppressed viral replication is mostly not sustainable, and loss of HBsAg is a rarely achieved endpoint. In addition, the hepatitis B virus persists in hepatocytes even after HBsAg clearance as covalently closed circular DNA is not eliminated from the hepatocytes. Because the course of chronic hepatitis B is determined by an ongoing interaction between the virus and the host immune system, immunomodulation may be the most logical approach in attempting to accomplish control or even cure of chronic hepatitis B. In the last years, methods for measuring the degree of immune control have been a major area of interest, with an important role for monitoring of HBsAg levels. In addition, new immunomodulatory agents are being developed and tested, providing promising options for future treatment.",eng,Hepatology international,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Approximately one in ten road injuries involves a femoral shaft fracture that is most effectively treated with surgery. Current femoral shaft fracture incidence according to country and age group is unknown and difficult to measure directly but is critical to designing and evaluating interventions.--NEW SECTION--We modeled femoral shaft fracture incidence from road traffic collisions with use of World Bank, World Health Organization, and Global Burden of Disease Study data for 176 countries and five age groups. We used road traffic death rates, ratios of road traffic deaths to injuries, and proportions of road traffic injuries that were femoral shaft fractures to calculate the fracture incidence.--NEW SECTION--The worldwide annual femoral shaft fracture incidence from road traffic collisions was between 1.0 and 2.9 million. Incidence rates were significantly higher in low and middle income countries compared with high income countries. Overall, low and middle income countries had a mean femoral shaft fracture incidence between 15.7 and 45.5 per 100,000 people per year, with a rate ratio of 2.08 (95% confidence interval, 2.02 to 2.13; p < 0.001) relative to high income countries.--NEW SECTION--Our results demonstrate a substantial worldwide burden and disparities in femoral shaft fracture incidence between low to middle income and high income countries, and the young are disproportionately affected, underscoring the potential impact of improved access to treatment. We believe that the methodology of this study can be applied to estimate the burden of other diseases, allowing for better direction of global health efforts.",eng,The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

However, largely overlooked in the context of other foreign policy and diplomatic priorities are the serious public health consequences for the region following the annexation of Crimea and the subsequent decision to ban opioid substitution therapy in the disputed territory.--NEW SECTION--On 1 May 2014, the Republic of Crimea officially announced it would end access to opioid substitution therapy, an essential harm reduction tool recognized by international organizations and virtually all other European countries. The policy development marks a critical reversal in the region's fight against its growing HIV epidemic and also threatens years of public health gains aimed at providing evidence-based and integrated treatment approaches to combat drug dependence and HIV. Beyond these risks, the Ukrainian conflict could also negatively impact control of other infectious diseases that are converging with HIV and injection drug use, such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and hepatitis C virus. The continuing conflict is also likely to have a significant negative impact on Ukraine's fragile public health system leading to even worse population health outcomes than currently experienced by the country.--NEW SECTION--In response to this crisis, the application of global health diplomacy principles represents a possible route of advocacy to ensure that HIV prevention, humane treatment of substance using populations, and improving public health outcomes in the region are pursued among concerned international stakeholders. In order to be effective, global health diplomacy efforts must be coordinated and advocated in all forms of diplomatic engagement, including at the core, multistakeholder and informal levels and through existing channels such as the different human rights bodies of the United Nations as well as amongst other actors. Hence, the Ukraine crisis represents a critical moment for the practice and advancement of global health diplomacy in order to ensure global public health priorities are given their rightful place in foreign policy making to hopefully help in bringing resolution to the current conflict.",eng,Journal of the International AIDS Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Debridement is an important process to decrease risk of infection and promote healing. Enzymatic debridement with, for example, clostridial collagenase ointment (CCO) has been shown to assist with the achievement and maintenance of a clean wound bed in preparation for closure. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has also been used successfully for the treatment of wounds. Although conclusive research has demonstrated positive independent effects of both CCO and NPWT as treatments for chronic pressure ulcers, there are no known published studies that have investigated the 2 as a conjunctive treatment.--NEW SECTION--A retrospective analysis of 114 adult patients was conducted to assess wound healing of chronic pressure ulcers in a setting with medically complex patients. Two groups were established comparing those who received NPWT alone to those who received NPWT plus CCO. The study sample included 67 patients treated with NPWT + CCO and 47 patients who received only NPWT.--NEW SECTION--Results were similar for both treatment groups with mean values indicating the cohorts were closely aligned with respect to wound size, complexity, length of long-term acute care hospital stay, and duration of NPWT. The patients who received NPWT + CCO demonstrated statistically significant changes in several key areas including initial Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT) score, changes in the overall BWAT score and in the necrotic tissue domain.--NEW SECTION--Data analysis from this retrospective study indicates patients who received both therapies (NPWT + CCO) demonstrated improved outcomes in speed of debridement and rate of wound closure compared to those who received NPWT alone.",eng,Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

Selenium is an essential trace element because of role in major metabolic processes, immune function, thyroid hormone metabolism, male infertility, neoplasms and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to investigate for the first time in the Saudi population the association between vitamin D and selenium status with various dietary products consumption. A total of 259 children and 95 adults were included in this cross-sectional study. We estimated the consumption frequencies of various dietary food products using a qualitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and also measured serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and selenium. Associations between variables of interest were assessed. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were observed in 80% of the boys, 90% of the girls, 64% of men and 50% of women. Modest associations were found between mean serum 25 (OH) D concentration and consumption frequencies of fresh milk in children (r=0.11; P<0.05), more specifically in girls (r=0.12; P<0.05), and to the overall consumption of dairy products in women (r=0.12; P<0.05). Vitamin D status was also inversely associated with selenium in adults (r=-0.43; P<0.05). There was a significant correlation between delta changes of serum selenium, triglycerides and HDL levels (P-values <0.05). Vitamin D and selenium levels are modestly associated with dietary products consumption. Changes in selenium levels were associated with increased serum triglyceride levels, indicating a potential biomarker for cardiovascular risk and dyslipidemia. The widespread vitamin D deficiency observed in the present study highlight the need for adequate fortification of dairy products.",eng,International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The purpose of this study was to review the recent literature and estimate the mortality associated with pediatric surgical conditions in this setting.--NEW SECTION--We completed a comprehensive search for studies that: (1) reported outcomes associated with pediatric surgical conditions; (2) were conducted in LMICs in Africa; and (3) were published between 2007 and 2012. Abstract screening, full-text review, and data abstraction were completed in duplicate. Mortality rates were pooled using a random effects model.--NEW SECTION--Out of 2085 abstracts, 292 were selected for textual review, and 107 underwent complete data abstraction. Only 74 (68%) of these reported mortality explicitly. The highest pooled mortality rates were seen with esophageal atresia (72%), midgut volvulus (36%), and jejunoileal atresia (35%). Pooled mortality was 17% for congenital conditions and 9% for acquired disease. The overall mortality rate for all conditions was 12%.--NEW SECTION--Mortality following pediatric surgical conditions in LMICs in Africa remains high, especially for congenital conditions in neonates.

25783188,10.1002/dev.21294,New era for chimpanzee research: broad implications of chimpanzee research decisions.,"The unprecedented recent decision-making about chimpanzees supported for biomedical science by the US National Institutes of Health attracted international attention and significantly changed many dimensions of chimpanzee research. Many public and media portrayals incorrectly generalized the NIH findings to conclude that chimpanzee research itself was no longer necessary. In fact, the broader question of the necessity and value of the full range of chimpanzee research was never asked, evaluated, or within the NIH's primary charge. The Institute of Medicine evaluative panel found that research with chimpanzees was necessary for some, but not all, purposes. The panel's findings also led the NIH to introduce new standards for the care and management of NIH-supported chimpanzees and a new mechanism for ethical review of grant proposals involving chimpanzees. The NIH evaluation and decisions could not address all captive chimpanzees and all types of research. However, the process did underscore the need for a more expansive framework for continued ethical review and decision-making to responsibly address the future of captive chimpanzee management and research. Among the broader considerations are extension of evidence-informed standards to ensure equitable care and treatment of all chimpanzees; determining the global impact of limited captive populations; and balancing benefit and harm at individual, species, societal, and environmental levels. The breadth and longevity of impact from the current US decisions suggest the need for many voices, disciplines, and stakeholders to address the complex interplay between science, animal welfare, and global health.",eng,Developmental psychobiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The species tropism of these hepatotropic pathogens is restricted to chimpanzees and humans, thus model systems to study their pathological mechanisms are severely limited. Although these pathogens infect hepatocytes, disease pathology is intimately related to the degree and quality of the immune response. As a first step to decipher the immune response to infected hepatocytes, we developed an animal model harboring both a human immune system (HIS) and human hepatocytes (HUHEP) in BALB/c Rag2-/- IL-2Rγc-/- NOD.sirpa uPAtg/tg mice. The extent and kinetics of human hepatocyte engraftment were similar between HUHEP and HIS-HUHEP mice. Transplanted human hepatocytes were polarized and mature in vivo, resulting in 20-50% liver chimerism in these models. Human myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages developed at similar frequencies in HIS and HIS-HUHEP mice, and splenic and hepatic compartments were humanized with mature B cells, NK cells and naïve T cells, as well as monocytes and dendritic cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HIS-HUHEP mice can be stably (> 5 months) and robustly engrafted with a humanized immune system and chimeric human liver. This novel HIS-HUHEP model provides a platform to investigate human immune responses against hepatotropic pathogens and to test novel drug strategies or vaccine candidates.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Traditionally, the high prevalence of dyslipidemia in elderly people is considered a ""natural condition."" Notably, subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is one of the most important risk factors for dyslipidemia. Few studies have assessed whether SCH plays a role in the increase in age-related dyslipidemia. This study aimed to explore the association between SCH and lipid profiles in different age groups.--NEW SECTION--This was a large-scale, population-based, case-control study. The population was derived from the REACTION study conducted across China. A total of 17,046 individuals (8827 cases and 8219 controls) aged 40 years or older were enrolled in the final analyses. The relationships between SCH and serum lipid parameters in each age group were evaluated after adjustment for thyroid hormones and common confounding factors.--NEW SECTION--In the entire population, thyrotropin (TSH), the key indicator of SCH, was positively associated with cholesterol parameters (total cholesterol [TC] and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) through the sixth decade of life. After adjusting for common confounding factors and thyroid hormones, each 1 mIU/L increase in TSH was estimated to elevate the TC level by 0.0147 mmol/L and 0.0551 mmol/L, respectively, in individuals aged 40-49 years and 60-69 years. Similarly, with each 1 mIU/L increase in TSH, the LDL-C level tended to show gradually greater increases as age increased. In moderately old subjects (60-69 years), mild (TSH≤10 mIU/L) and significant (TSH>10 mIU/L) SCH increased the concentration of TC approximately 1.03- and 1.36-fold, and the concentration of LDL-C approximately 1.19- and 1.65-fold, respectively, when compared with younger subjects.--NEW SECTION--TSH exhibited a stronger effect on the TC and LDL-C level in moderately old subjects than in younger subjects.

A major complication of diabetes is cardiovascular disease, which accounts for over two-thirds of mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients. This increased risk has led to the definition of a diabetic cardiomyopathy phenotype characterised by early left ventricular dysfunction with normal ejection fraction. Here we review the aetiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy and explore the involvement of the protein caveolin-3 (Cav3). Cav3 forms part of a complex mechanism regulating insulin signalling and glucose uptake, processes that are impaired in diabetes. Further, Cav3 is key for stabilisation and trafficking of cardiac ion channels to the plasma membrane and so contributes to the cardiac action potential shape and duration. In addition, Cav3 has direct and indirect interactions with proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and so has the potential to influence cardiac contractility. Significantly, both impaired contractility and rhythm disturbances are hallmarks of diabetic cardiomyopathy. We review here how changes to Cav3 expression levels and altered relationships with interacting partners may be contributory factors to several of the pathological features identified in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Finally, the review concludes by considering ways in which levels of Cav3 may be manipulated in order to develop novel therapeutic approaches for treating diabetic cardiomyopathy.",eng,Pharmacology & therapeutics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In the present study, SYFPEITHI algorithm was used to screen the amino acid sequence of Dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) for potential epitopes, and seven putative HLA-A*1101-restricted and five putative HLA-A*2402-restricted epitopes conserved in hundreds of DENV-1 strains were synthesized. The binding affinity of these epitope candidates to corresponding HLA molecules was evaluated using competitive peptide-binding assay. The immunogenicity and specificity of peptides were further tested in HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice, HLA-A*2402 transgenic mice and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients infected with DENV-1. Percentage inhibition (PI) values calculated in competitive peptide-binding assay showed that six peptides (E39-47 PTLDIELLK, NS5(505-513) GVEGEGLHK, NS2b(15-23) SILLSSLLK, NS5(561-569) ALLATSIFK, NS3(99-107) AVEPGKNPK, and NS4b(159-167) VVYDAKFEK) could bind to HLA-A*1101 molecule with high affinity and five peptides (NS3472-480 QYIYMGQPL, NS4a40-48 AYRHAMEEL, NS5(880-888) DYMTSMKRF, NS3(548-556) SYKVASEGF, and NS3(22-30) IYRILQRGL) have a high affinity for HLA-A*2402 molecule. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) results indicated that these high-affinity peptides were recognized by splenocytes of DENV-1-infected transgenic mice and high-affinity peptide-immunized transgenic mice displayed high levels of peptide-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells. In addition, both peptide-pulsed splenocytes and DENV-1-infected splenic monocytes were efficiently killed by these peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Finally, except NS2b(15-23), 10 high-affinity peptides were recognized by PBMCs of patients infected with DENV-1.

Mixed logit models were used to analyze the data.--NEW SECTION--Among medical and nursing students a rural retention bonus of 75% of base salary (aOR= 8.27, 95% CI: 5.28-12.96, P< 0.001) and improved health facility infrastructure (aOR= 3.54, 95% CI: 2.73-4.58) respectively were the attributes with the largest effect sizes. Among medical doctors and nurse aides, a rural retention bonus of 75% of base salary was the attribute with the largest effect size (medical doctors aOR= 5.60, 95% CI: 4.12-7.61, P< 0.001; nurse aides aOR= 4.29, 95% CI: 3.11-5.93, P< 0.001). On the other hand, improved health facility infrastructure (aOR= 3.56, 95% CI: 2.75-4.60, P< 0.001), was the attribute with the largest effect size among the state registered nurses surveyed. Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) estimates were generated for each health worker cadre for all the attributes. Preference impact measurements were also estimated to identify combination of incentives that health workers would find most attractive.--NEW SECTION--Based on these findings, the study recommends the introduction of a system of substantial monetary bonuses for rural service along with ensuring adequate and functional equipment and uninterrupted supplies. By focusing on the analysis of locally relevant, actionable incentives, generated through the involvement of policy-makers at the design stage, this study provides an example of research directly linked to policy action to address a vitally important issue in global health.",eng,International journal of health policy and management,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Twenty-four elderly advanced NSCLC patients with a mean age of 73.0 ± 5.3 (65-83) years were categorized into three stratifications according to CGA results, namely function independent, mildly function impaired, and function dependent. They received standardized therapy, individualized therapy, and best supportive care, respectively. The patients receiving standardized therapy and individualized therapy were randomized into two groups, with or without traditional Chinese medicine for symptom control, while for all the patients receiving best supportive care, traditional Chinese medicine was administered. Nine non-elderly NSCLC patients (<65 years old) were enrolled as control and treated in accordance with NCCN NSCLC treatment guidelines. EORTC QLQ-C30 core scale, LC13 scale, and MDASI-TCM scale were used to assess relevant symptoms before and after treatment. After treatment for 3 weeks, it was shown by QLQ-C30+LC13 scales, for function-dependent patients, that the physical and role performances and the global health status were improved and the symptoms of fatigue and cough were alleviated; by MDASI-TCM scale, the symptoms of fatigue, cough, and expectoration were improved. In function-independent and mildly function-impaired elderly patients, there were no significant changes in functional status and symptoms. But in non-elderly patients, the physical and social performances were lowered, and the symptoms of fatigue, constipation, and poor appetite were aggravated. The elderly patients with advanced NSCLC were categorized on the basis of CGA findings, and traditional Chinese medicine may be beneficial to symptom control of function-dependent patients.",eng,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25771109,10.1016/j.ejmech.2015.03.015,Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of a novel series of synthetic phenylthiazole compounds against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections are a significant global health challenge in part due to the emergence of strains exhibiting resistance to nearly all classes of antibiotics. This underscores the urgent need for the rapid development of novel antimicrobials to circumvent this burgeoning problem. Previously, whole-cell screening of a library of 2,5-disubstituted thiazole compounds revealed a lead compound exhibiting potent antimicrobial activity against MRSA. The present study, conducting a more rigorous analysis of the structure-activity relationship of this compound, reveals a nonpolar, hydrophobic functional group is favored at thiazole-C2 and an ethylidenehydrazine-1-carboximidamide moiety is necessary at C5 for the compound to possess activity against MRSA. Furthermore, the MTS assay confirmed analogs 5, 22d, and 25 exhibited an improved toxicity profile (not toxic up to 40 μg/mL to mammalian cells) over the lead 1. Analysis with human liver microsomes revealed compound 5 was more metabolically stable compared to the lead compound (greater than eight-fold improvement in the half-life in human liver microsomes). Collectively the results presented demonstrate the novel thiazole derivatives synthesized warrant further exploration for potential use as future antimicrobial agents for the treatment of multidrug-resistant S. aureus infections.",eng,European journal of medicinal chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative studies were used to assess study quality.--NEW SECTION--39 studies met inclusion criteria and descriptive analysis was used. Findings were equivocal on the effect of conflict on tobacco use. Evidence was clearer on associations between post-traumatic stress and other mental disorders with nicotine dependence. However, there were too few studies for definitive conclusions. No study examined the effectiveness of tobacco-related interventions.

25770090,10.3402/gha.v8.27214,The role of 'hidden' community volunteers in community-based health service delivery platforms: examples from sub-Saharan Africa.,"Community-based research on child survival in sub-Saharan Africa has focussed on the increased provision of curative health services by a formalised cadre of lay community health workers (CHWs), but we have identified a particular configuration, that deserves closer scrutiny. We identified a two-tiered CHW system, with the first tier being the lessor known or 'hidden' community/village level volunteers and the second tier being formal, paid CHWs, in Ethiopia, Mali, and Niger. Whilst the disease-focussed tasks of the formal CHW tier may be more amenable to classic epidemiological surveillance, we postulate that understanding the relationship between formalised CHWs and volunteer cadres, in terms of scope, location of practice and ratio to population, would be important for a comprehensive evaluation of child survival in these countries. We report on the findings from our joint qualitative and quantitative investigations, highlighting the need to recognise the 'hidden' contribution of volunteers. We need to better characterize the volunteers' interaction with community-based and primary care services and to better understand ways to improve the volunteer systems with the right type of investments. This is particularly important for considering the models for scale-up of CHWs in sub-Saharan Africa.",eng,Global health action,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We examined if domain-specific transition questions had higher construct validity than global health transition questions as anchors for measures in a given domain.--NEW SECTION--In a prospective study of 249 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, we examined changes in pain, physical function, joint swelling, stiffness, fatigue, and depression with treatment. We related these changes to a domain-specific transition question, global arthritis transition question, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health transition item.--NEW SECTION--Changes in all six clinical measures were more highly correlated with the domain-specific transition questions than with the global arthritis question and SF-36 transition question. Discrimination between patients who improved or not was also better using domain-specific questions. Estimates of minimal clinically important improvement (MCII) differed with the anchor when these were based on mean changes.

In the health sector, however, there has been relatively little progress in data analysis and application despite a rapid rise in data production. Given adequate governance, improvements in the quality, quantity, storage and analysis of health data could lead to substantial improvements in many health outcomes. In low- and middle-income countries in particular, the creation of an information feedback mechanism can move health-care delivery towards results-based practice and improve the effective use of scarce resources. We review the evolving definition of big data and the possible advantages of - and problems in - using such data to improve health-care delivery in low- and middle-income countries. The collection of big data as mobile-phone based services improve may mean that development phases required elsewhere can be skipped. However, poor infrastructure may prevent interoperability and the safe use of patient data.

For the surveillance and control of dengue, there is a need for robust diagnostic tools that are relatively easy to use and reliable in various clinical settings. We investigated the applicability of NS1 antigen detection in urine samples for the diagnosis of DENV. About 118 urine samples, obtained from 96 dengue patients at various phases of disease, were used for this study. NS1 antigen was detected by ELISA in the urine samples obtained from patients after 2-17 days of disease onset. Positive detection rates of NS1 antigen ranged between 13-43%. Based on real-time RT-PCR, positive detection rates of viral genome in the urine samples ranged between 20-33% on days 0 to ≥15. On days 11 to ≥15 after the disease onset, NS1 antigen was detected at similar rates in serum and urine samples. Additionally, NS1 antigen was detected in 2 urine samples, but not in the serum samples, on days 7 and 16 after the onset of the disease. The results confirm the applicability of NS1 antigen detection in urine samples using ELISA to diagnose acute DENV infection and suggests that the assay is potentially useful when only limited amounts of serum samples are available and in limited resource settings.",eng,Japanese journal of infectious diseases,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2015

The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of infections play out on a wide range of interconnected temporal, organizational, and spatial scales, which span hours to months, cells to ecosystems, and local to global spread. Moreover, some pathogens are directly transmitted between individuals of a single species, whereas others circulate among multiple hosts, need arthropod vectors, or can survive in environmental reservoirs. Many factors, including increasing antimicrobial resistance, increased human connectivity and changeable human behavior, elevate prevention and control from matters of national policy to international challenge.

In advanced NSCLC, gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) and docetaxel plus cisplatin (DC) exhibit comparable efficacy, with possibly superior QoL compared to VC. This trial investigated these regimens in the adjuvant setting.--NEW SECTION--Patients with Stage IB to III NSCLC were eligible following standardized surgery. Overall, 136 patients were included, with 67 and 69 assigned to the GC and DC arms, respectively. Cisplatin (75 mg/m(2), Day [D] 1) plus gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2), D1 and D8) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) D1) were administered for three cycles. Primary end-point was QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30), with the study designed to detect a 10-point difference between arms. Overall survival, safety and cost were secondary end-points.--NEW SECTION--No between-group imbalance was observed in terms of patient characteristics. At inclusion, global health status (GHS) scores (/100) were 63.5 and 62.7 in GC and DC, respectively (P = 0.8), improving to 64.5 and 65.4 after 3 months (P = 0.8). No significant difference in functional or symptoms scores was observed between the arms except for alopecia.

RNA interference (RNAi) plays an important role in antiviral immunity, gene regulation and protection from transposable elements. Double-stranded RNA binding proteins (dsRBPs) are important for efficient RNAi; in Drosophila functional specialization of the miRNA, endo-siRNA and exo-siRNA pathway is aided by the dsRBPs Loquacious (Loqs-PB, Loqs-PD) and R2D2, respectively. However, this functional specialization has not been investigated in other dipterans. We were unable to detect Loqs-PD in Ae. aegypti; analysis of other dipteran genomes demonstrated that this isoform is not conserved outside of Drosophila. Overexpression experiments and small RNA sequencing following depletion of each dsRBP revealed that R2D2 and Loqs-PA cooperate non-redundantly in siRNA production, and that these proteins exhibit an inhibitory effect on miRNA levels. Conversely, Loqs-PB alone interacted with mosquito dicer-1 and was essential for full miRNA production. Mosquito Loqs interacted with both argonaute 1 and 2 in a manner independent of its interactions with dicer. We conclude that the functional specialization of Loqs-PD in Drosophila is a recently derived trait, and that in other dipterans, including the medically important mosquitoes, Loqs-PA participates in both the miRNA and endo-siRNA based pathways.",eng,Nucleic acids research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Studies published in English between 1990 and 2013 which describe Bangladeshi adolescent women's healthcare-seeking behaviour during pregnancy, delivery and post-partum were included.--NEW SECTION--Twelve studies were included in this review. 11 used quantitative methods and one used a mixed-methods approach. All studies included married adolescent women only. Women with lower educational levels are less likely to seek skilled maternal health services than those with higher levels of education. Use of maternal health services is also less common among rural married adolescent women than women in urban areas. Being part of the richest bands of wealth, having had previous experiences of childbirth and higher women's autonomy positively influence the use of skilled maternal health services among married adolescent women in Bangladesh. Antenatal care is a key predictor of the use of skilled birth attendants for delivery and post-natal care.--NEW SECTION--Maternal health-related programmes should be designed targeting rural and uneducated married adolescent women in Bangladesh. More qualitative investigations are required to broaden our understanding on maternal health-seeking behaviour of both married and unmarried adolescent women.",eng,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25757613,10.1007/978-1-4939-2432-5_1,Gene therapies for hepatitis C virus.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis and infects approximately three to four million people per year, about 170 million infected people in total, making it one of the major global health problems. In a minority of cases HCV is cleared spontaneously, but in most of the infected individuals infection progresses to a chronic state associated with high risk to develop liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, or liver failure. The treatment of HCV infection has evolved over the years. Interferon (IFN)-α in combination with ribavirin has been used for decades as standard therapy. More recently, a new standard-of-care treatment has been approved based on a triple combination with either HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir or boceprevir. In addition, various options for all-oral, IFN-free regimens are currently being evaluated. Despite substantial improvement of sustained virological response rates, some intrinsic limitations of these new direct-acting antivirals, including serious side effects, the risk of resistance development and high cost, urge the development of alternative or additional therapeutic strategies. Gene therapy represents a feasible alternative treatment. Small RNA technology, including RNA interference (RNAi) techniques and antisense approaches, is one of the potentially promising ways to investigate viral and host cell factors that are involved in HCV infection and replication. With this, newly developed gene therapy regimens will be provided to treat HCV. In this chapter, a comprehensive overview guides you through the current developments and applications of RNAi and microRNA-based gene therapy strategies in HCV treatment.",eng,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The cause of iron deficiency and anemia is usually a combination of increased loss and decreased intestinal absorption and delivery from iron stores due to inflammation. Oral iron is first line treatment, but often hampered by intolerance. Intravenous iron is safe, and the preferred treatment in patients with chronic inflammation and bowel diseases. The goal of treatment is normalisation of hemoglobin concentration and recovery of iron stores.

25755710,NA,Boswellic acid attenuates asthma phenotypes by downregulation of GATA3 via pSTAT6 inhibition in a murine model of asthma.,"Asthma is a serious global health problem characterised by airway inflammation, airway epithelial wall shedding, enhanced mucus production, increased IgE levels and airway hyperresponsiveness. The pathophysiology of asthma is mediated by Th2 cells which produce Th2 cytokines like interleukin-4, interleukin-5, interleukin-13 and interleukin-9. The differentiation of Th2 cells is induced by the transcription factor GATA3 which is activated by pSTAT6 via IL-4 signalling. To investigate the anti-asthmatic potential of Boswellic acid, as well as the underlying mechanism involved, we studied its anti-asthmatic potential in a murine model of asthma. In this study, BALB/c mice were systemically sensitized by ovalbumin (OVA) followed by aerosol allergen challenges. We investigated the effect of Boswellic acid on airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammatory cell infiltration, Th2 cytokine and OVA-specific IgE production in a mouse model of asthma. We found that Boswellic acid treated groups suppressed allergic airway inflammation, AHR, OVA-specific IgE and Th2 cytokines secretion. It also suppressed the expression of pSTAT6 and GATA3 in a dose dependent manner. Our data suggest that the mechanism by which Boswellic acid effectively treats asthma is based on reductions of Th2 cytokines via inhibition of pSTAT6 and GATA-3 expression.",eng,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This study evaluates the impact of docetaxel toxicities on patient's health-related quality of life (QoL).--NEW SECTION--We conducted a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional trial, in which the QoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires at baseline and every 4 weeks up to 40 weeks in patients receiving a docetaxel-based chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Treatment-related adverse events were correlated with the corresponding QoL scores. Uni- and multivariate analyses were applied.--NEW SECTION--From January 2008 to June 2011, a total of 2659 patients were included. The majority of patients (48.1%) had prostate cancer, followed by breast (17.1%) and non-small-cell-lung cancer (15.8%). Patients received a median of 5 docetaxel cycles with the median dose of 75 mg/m(2). The presence of grade 3/4 diarrhea showed the strongest effect on global health status/QoL average scores (50.91 versus 33.06), followed by vomiting (50.91 versus 35.17), dyspnea (50.94 versus 35.81), mucositis/stomatitis (50.88 versus 36.41), nausea (50.91 versus 36.68), infection (50.90 versus 37.14), fatigue (50.90 versus 43.82) and anemia (50.91 versus 41.03), P < 0.05 for all comparisons. Grade 3/4 leukopenia/neutropenia, alopecia, constipation, neurotoxicity and nail disorders had no significant impact on the global health status/QoL or other items.--NEW SECTION--In this large non-interventional trial, docetaxel-associated grade 3 or 4 toxicities were shown to have a strong detrimental effect on patient's QoL. Notably, diarrhea and vomiting had the strongest negative impact on QoL measures.

We sought to determine if daily biomass fuel use was associated with elevated blood pressure in high altitude Peru and if this relationship was affected by lung function. We analyzed baseline information from a population-based cohort study of adults aged ≥ 35 years in Puno, Peru. Daily biomass fuel use was self-reported. We used multivariable regression models to examine the relationship between daily exposure to biomass fuel smoke and blood pressure outcomes. Interactions with sex and quartiles of forced vital capacity were conducted to evaluate for effect modification. Data from 1004 individuals (mean age, 55.3 years; 51.7% women) were included. We found an association between biomass fuel use with both prehypertension (adjusted relative risk ratio, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-9.9) and hypertension (adjusted relative risk ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-7.0). Biomass fuel users had a higher systolic blood pressure (7.0 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, 4.4-9.6) and a higher diastolic blood pressure (5.9 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, 4.2-7.6) when compared with nonusers. We did not find interaction effects between daily biomass fuel use and sex or percent predicted forced vital capacity for either systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure.

25753287,10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.02.041,"The stories we tell: qualitative research interviews, talking technologies and the 'normalisation' of life with HIV.","Since the earliest days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, talking about the virus has been a key way affected communities have challenged the fear and discrimination directed against them and pressed for urgent medical and political attention. Today, HIV/AIDS is one of the most prolifically and intimately documented of all health conditions, with entrenched infrastructures, practices and technologies--what Vinh-Kim Nguyen has dubbed 'confessional technologies'--aimed at encouraging those affected to share their experiences. Among these technologies, we argue, is the semi-structured interview: the principal methodology used in qualitative social science research focused on patient experiences. Taking the performative nature of the research interview as a talking technology seriously has epistemological implications not merely for how we interpret interview data, but also for how we understand the role of research interviews in the enactment of 'life with HIV'. This paper focuses on one crucial aspect of this enactment: the contemporary 'normalisation' of HIV as 'just another' chronic condition--a process taking place at the level of individual subjectivities, social identities, clinical practices and global health policy, and of which social science research is a vital part. Through an analysis of 76 interviews conducted in London (2009-10), we examine tensions in the experiential narratives of individuals living with HIV in which life with the virus is framed as 'normal', yet where this 'normality' is beset with contradictions and ambiguities. Rather than viewing these as a reflection of resistances to or failures of the enactment of HIV as 'normal', we argue that, insofar as these contradictions are generated by the research interview as a distinct 'talking technology', they emerge as crucial to the normative (re)production of what counts as 'living with HIV' (in the UK) and are an inherent part of the broader performative 'normalisation' of the virus.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Patients with COPD are more susceptible to infection, which exacerbates their condition and increases morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms of increased susceptibility remain poorly understood, and current preventions and treatments have substantial limitations.--NEW SECTION--To characterize the mechanisms of increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection in COPD and the potential for therapeutic targeting.--NEW SECTION--We used a combination of primary bronchial epithelial cells (pBECs) from COPD and healthy control subjects, a mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced experimental COPD, and influenza infection. The role of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway was characterized using molecular methods, and its potential for targeting assessed using inhibitors.--NEW SECTION--COPD pBECs were susceptible to increased viral entry and replication. Infected mice with experimental COPD also had more severe infection (increased viral titer and pulmonary inflammation, and compromised lung function). These processes were associated with impaired antiviral immunity, reduced retinoic acid-inducible gene-I, and IFN/cytokine and chemokine responses. Increased PI3K-p110α levels and activity in COPD pBECs and/or mice were responsible for increased infection and reduced antiviral responses. Global PI3K, specific therapeutic p110α inhibitors, or exogenous IFN-β restored protective antiviral responses, suppressed infection, and improved lung function.--NEW SECTION--The increased susceptibility of individuals with COPD to influenza likely results from impaired antiviral responses, which are mediated by increased PI3K-p110α activity. This pathway may be targeted therapeutically in COPD, or in healthy individuals, during seasonal or pandemic outbreaks to prevent and/or treat influenza.",eng,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

It examines both the curriculum provided and profile of the student currently studying global health in the UK.--NEW SECTION--Descriptive, case study design.--NEW SECTION--A systematic review of the literature identified a set of global health 'core competencies' that students could acquire through their chosen programme of study. Those competencies were synthesized and then compared to core and elective courses currently offered by global health degree programmes at UK universities. A questionnaire was designed and sent electronically to all global health Programme Directors requesting generic information regarding the profile of their global health students.--NEW SECTION--Fifteen universities in the UK, based in England and Scotland, offered twenty-five postgraduate and six undergraduate global health degree programmes in 2012-13. Two Universities were developing a full, three-year, undergraduate degree programme in global health. Sixteen core competencies for a medical and non-medical student constituency were identified. Of these, just three 'core competencies' - epidemiology of tropical diseases, health systems (including health system management), and health care services - corresponded directly to core and elective courses offered by >50% of UK universities. The five most frequently offered subjects were: health systems (including health system management), research methods, public health (including specialisations in prevention, treatment and care), epidemiology, and health economics.--NEW SECTION--GHE in UK universities has seen comparable growth to North American institutions, becoming Europe's regional hub for undergraduate and postgraduate courses and programmes. As with the US and Canadian experience, GHE at the undergraduate level is offered primarily to medical students through intercalated degree programmes. At the postgraduate level, there is more innovation in content and mode of delivery, with a small number of UK universities providing students from a diversity of backgrounds the opportunity to study global health from multidisciplinary perspectives. Distance learning is also seeking to make the delivery of GHE truly global, with a growing number of universities recognizing its potential to further innovate in global health pedagogy.

However, only 3.5% of the 234.2 million cases per year of major surgery are performed in countries where the world's poorest third reside, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).--NEW SECTION--Data on the availability of anesthesia and surgical services were gathered from 12 DRC district hospitals using the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Emergency and Essential Surgical Care Situation Analysis Tool. We complemented these data with an analysis of the costs of surgical services in a Congolese norms-based district hospital as well as in 2 of the 12 hospitals in which we conducted the situational analysis (Demba and Kabare District Hospitals). For the cost analysis, we used WHO's integrated Healthcare Technology Package tool.--NEW SECTION--Of the 32 surgical interventions surveyed, only 2 of the 12 hospitals provided all essential services. The deficits in procedures varied from no deficits to 17 services that could not be provided, with an average of 7 essential procedures unavailable. Many of the hospitals did not have basic infrastructure such as running water and electricity; 9 of 12 had no or interrupted water and 7 of 12 had no or interrupted electricity. On average, 21% of lifesaving surgical interventions were absent from the facilities, compared with the model normative hospital. According to the normative hospital, all surgical services would cost US$2.17 per inhabitant per year, representing 33.3% of the total patient caseload but only 18.3% of the total district hospital operating budget. At Demba Hospital, the operating budget required for surgical interventions was US$0.08 per inhabitant per year, and at Kabare Hospital, US$0.69 per inhabitant per year.--NEW SECTION--A significant portion of the health problems addressed at Congolese district hospitals is surgical in nature, but there is a current inability to meet this surgical need. The deficient services and substandard capacity in the surveyed district hospitals are systemic in nature, representing infrastructure, supply, equipment, and human resource constraints. Yet surgical services are affordable and represent a minor portion of the total operating budget.

25744620,10.1177/0269881115573542,Antidepressants and the adolescent brain.,"Major unipolar depression is a significant global health problem, with the highest incident risk being during adolescence. A depressive illness during this period is associated with negative long-term consequences including suicide, additional psychiatric comorbidity, interpersonal relationship problems, poor educational performance and poor employment attainment well into adult life. Despite previous safety concerns, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remain a key component of the treatment of moderate to severe depression episodes in adolescents. The impact of SSRIs on the developing adolescent brain, however, remains unclear. In this review we first consider what is currently known about the developing brain during adolescence and how these development processes may be affected by a depressive illness. We then review our understanding of the action of SSRIs, their effects on the brain and how these may differ between adults and adolescents. We conclude that there is currently little evidence to indicate that the human adolescent brain is at developmental risk from SSRIs. Furthermore, there is no clear-cut evidence to support the concerns of marked suicidal adverse side effects accruing in depressed adolescents being treated with SSRIs. Neither, however, is there irrefutable evidence to dismiss all such concerns. This makes SSRI prescribing a matter of medical judgement, ensuring the benefits outweigh the risks for the individual patients, as with so much in therapeutics. Overall, SSRIs show clinical benefits that we judge to outweigh the risks to neurodevelopment and are an important therapeutic choice in the treatment of moderate to severe adolescent depression.",eng,"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25744368,10.1139/cjpp-2014-0386,Vitamin D: Immuno-modulation and tuberculosis treatment.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem and often coincides with vitamin D deficiency. High doses of vitamin D were widely used to treat TB during the pre-antibiotic era. Vitamin D exerts its action through vitamin D receptor (VDR), and VDR gene polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility or resistance to tuberculosis as well as sputum smear and culture conversion during anti-TB treatment. In-vitro studies have revealed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 enhances innate immunity by increased expression of various antimicrobial peptides, including cathelicidin, and induction of autophagy of the infected cells thus restricts the intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages. On the other hand, vitamin D has been shown to suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokine response and enhance the anti-inflammatory response. Supplementation with vitamin D in concert with treatment for TB may be beneficial with respect to minimizing the excessive tissue damage that occurs during the active stage of tuberculosis disease. Several clinical trials have evaluated vitamin D supplementation as an adjunct therapy in the treatment for tuberculosis. However, results are conflicting, owing to variations in dose regimens and outcomes. Further investigations are needed to find the optimal concentration of vitamin D for supplementation with standard anti-TB drugs to optimize treatment, which could help to effectively manage both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis.",eng,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25744336,10.1016/j.parint.2015.02.005,Chronic Chagas disease with advanced cardiac complications in Japan: Case report and literature review.,"Due to the unprecedented recent increases in global migration, Chagas disease has become a global health threat and its epidemiology has drastically changed. Here we describe the first case in Japan of benznidazole treatment for chronic Chagas disease characterized by advanced cardiac complications. A 55-year-old Japanese-Brazilian woman who had previously presented with chronic heart failure was diagnosed as having Chagas disease and treated with benznidazole to prevent aggravation of her cardiac complications. However, benznidazole administration was stopped on day 56 due to severe drug-induced peripheral neuritis. Sixteen months later, her serologic test for Trypanosoma cruzi is still positive and she is being followed regularly by cardiology. Despite an estimated prevalence of over 4000 cases in Japan, only a few cases of Chagas disease have been reported. A Medline search revealed only 7 cases identified between 1995 and 2014 in Japan: in 6 cases, complications of chronic Chagas disease were apparent at the time of presentation, and sudden death occurred in 2 of these cases due to cardiac complications. This clinical case and literature review re-emphasize the urgent need to establish a surveillance network and improve the diagnostic methods and treatment framework for Chagas disease in Japan.",eng,Parasitology international,Case Reports,2025-04-23,2015

The k-nearest-neighbor algorithm (kNN) estimates individual risks using an intuitive tool. This study compares the performances of this approach with the Cox and the Gail models for the 5-year breast cancer risk prediction. The study included 64,995 women from the French E3N prospective cohort. The sample was divided into a learning (N = 51,821) series to learn the models using fivefold cross-validation and a validation (N = 13,174) series to evaluate them. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the expected over observed number of cases (E/O) ratio were estimated. In the two series, 393 and 78 premenopausal and 537 and 98 postmenopausal breast cancers were diagnosed. The discrimination values of the best combinations of predictors obtained from cross-validation ranged from 0.59 to 0.60. In the validation series, the AUC values in premenopausal and postmenopausal women were 0.583 [0.520; 0.646] and 0.621 [0.563; 0.679] using the kNN and 0.565 [0.500; 0.631] and 0.617 [0.561; 0.673] using the Cox model. The E/O ratios were 1.26 and 1.28 in premenopausal women and 1.44 and 1.40 in postmenopausal women. The applied Gail model provided AUC values of 0.614 [0.554; 0.675] and 0.549 [0.495; 0.604] and E/O ratios of 0.78 and 1.12. This study shows that the prediction performances differed according to menopausal status when using parametric statistical tools. The k-nearest-neighbor approach performed well, and discrimination was improved in postmenopausal women compared with the Gail model.",eng,Breast cancer research and treatment,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

Despite the relevance of this global health issue, the knowledge level on CLP is alarmingly low. Therefore, it was our aim to construct a realistic haptic anatomic CLP model that can be used for 3-dimensional visualizing CLP and practicing the first steps of CLP treatment.--NEW SECTION--Models of newborns with CLP are not commercially available so far. Therefore, construction was based on a purchased baby doll of a healthy newborn. After fabrication of the model, we used it in a hands-on course for medical students. A total of 138 students were asked to perform practical tasks such as like taking intraoral impressions and fixating drinking and nasoalveolar plates on the CLP model. To evaluate the didactic benefit, preteaching and postteaching multiple-choice tests were performed.--NEW SECTION--A suitable patient's plaster model from our archive served as a template for shaping a unilateral CLP in the face of a baby doll by means of a scalpel and a handheld rotating milling machine. Hard and soft palate were milled out and replaced by a hard stone cast of a patient with cleft palate. When analyzing the preteaching and postteaching scores of the students' multiple-choice tests, an improvement was achieved in 69.6%, which proved to be statistically significant (P < 0.001).--NEW SECTION--In our opinion, the CLP model is a useful teaching tool with a high potential to improve the level of knowledge and practical expertise in the field of CLP.",eng,Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25741339,10.3389/fimmu.2015.00062,Is there a role for probiotics in the prevention of preterm birth?,"Preterm birth (PTB) continues to be a global health challenge. An over-production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as an altered maternal vaginal microbiome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation/infection-associated PTB. Lactobacillus represents the dominant species in the vagina of most healthy pregnant women. The depletion of Lactobacillus in women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) has been associated with an increased risk of PTB. It remains unknown at what point an aberrant vaginal microbiome composition specifically induces the cascade leading to PTB. The ability of oral or vaginal lactobacilli probiotics to reduce BV occurrence and/or dampen inflammation is being considered as a means to prevent PTB. Certain anti-inflammatory properties of lactobacilli suggest potential mechanisms. To date, clinical studies have not been powered with sufficiently high rates of PTB, but overall, there is merit in examining this promising area of clinical science.",eng,Frontiers in immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25740991,10.1128/JVI.00264-15,Role of hydrogen sulfide in paramyxovirus infections.,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gaseous mediator that has gained increasing recognition as an important player in modulating acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, its role in virus-induced lung inflammation is currently unknown. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children for which no vaccine or effective treatment is available. Using the slow-releasing H2S donor GYY4137 and propargylglycin (PAG), an inhibitor of cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), a key enzyme that produces intracellular H2S, we found that RSV infection led to a reduced ability to generate and maintain intracellular H2S levels in airway epithelial cells (AECs). Inhibition of CSE with PAG resulted in increased viral replication and chemokine secretion. On the other hand, treatment of AECs with the H2S donor GYY4137 reduced proinflammatory mediator production and significantly reduced viral replication, even when administered several hours after viral absorption. GYY4137 also significantly reduced replication and inflammatory chemokine production induced by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and Nipah virus (NiV), suggesting a broad inhibitory effect of H2S on paramyxovirus infections. GYY4137 treatment had no effect on RSV genome replication or viral mRNA and protein synthesis, but it inhibited syncytium formation and virus assembly/release. GYY4137 inhibition of proinflammatory gene expression occurred by modulation of the activation of the key transcription factors nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) at a step subsequent to their nuclear translocation. H2S antiviral and immunoregulatory properties could represent a novel treatment strategy for paramyxovirus infections.--NEW SECTION--RSV is a global health concern, causing significant morbidity and economic losses as well as mortality in developing countries. After decades of intensive research, no vaccine or effective treatment, with the exception of immunoprophylaxis, is available for this infection as well as for other important respiratory mucosal viruses. This study identifies hydrogen sulfide as a novel cellular mediator that can modulate viral replication and proinflammatory gene expression, both important determinants of lung injury in respiratory viral infections, with potential for rapid translation of such findings into novel therapeutic approaches for viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Viral replication is thought to occur in close association with remodelled host cell membranes, with non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) being a key player in this process. NS4B is a poorly characterized integral membrane protein, which has been reported to be palmitoylated at its carboxy-terminal end. In order to extend this observation and to establish a functional role for NS4B palmitoylation, we sought to determine the status of this post-translational modification when the protein was expressed as part of a functional viral replicase. We performed direct metabolic labelling and polyethylene glycol-maleimide palmitoylation reporter assays on NS4B expressed in cells containing subgenomic replicons and infectious viral RNA. In a vaccinia virus-based expression system NS4B palmitoylation was detected in a genotype-dependent manner. However, in spite of the high sensitivity of the methods used, no NS4B palmitoylation was found in physiologically more relevant systems. Thus, NS4B palmitoylation is most likely dispensable for HCV RNA replication.",eng,The Journal of general virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The systematic search of the literature yielded 18,311 unique citations. After screening titles and abstracts, we excluded 10,461 citations as clearly irrelevant to this systematic review, leaving 1,682 for full-text review. Furthermore, 1,373 publications were excluded following the validity assessment. Overall, 192 studies of 1,502,260 children aged 1 to 14 y in 74 countries and 186 studies of 3,265,546 individuals aged 5 y or older in 67 countries were included in separate metaregressions for untreated caries in deciduous and permanent teeth, respectively, using modeling resources from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study. In 2010, untreated caries in permanent teeth was the most prevalent condition worldwide, affecting 2.4 billion people, and untreated caries in deciduous teeth was the 10th-most prevalent condition, affecting 621 million children worldwide. The global age-standardized prevalence and incidence of untreated caries remained static between 1990 and 2010. There is evidence that the burden of untreated caries is shifting from children to adults, with 3 peaks in prevalence at ages 6, 25, and 70 y. Also, there were considerable variations in prevalence and incidence between regions and countries. Policy makers need to be aware of a predictable increasing burden of untreated caries due to population growth and longevity and a significant decrease in the prevalence of total tooth loss throughout the world from 1990 to 2010.",eng,Journal of dental research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This article reviews the major ethical issues arising when social media are used for research, public health, mobile health applications, and global health. It focuses on social media use outside fiduciary relationships between healthcare professionals and patients. Emphasis is given to the potential of social media in these contexts, the ethical issues relatively unique to each, and where possible how existing ethical principles and frameworks could help navigate these issues. In some cases social media create the circumstance for particular ethical issues but also facilitate managing them, such as in informed consent for research. In other cases, disagreement exists about whether social media - despite their potential - should be used for certain purposes, such as in public health surveillance (where confidentiality represents a significant ethical concern). In still others, ethical uncertainty exists about how social media will affect ethical issues, such as inequality in global health. As social media technologies continue to develop, identifying and managing the ethical issues they raise will be critical to their success in improving health while preserving fundamental ethical values.",eng,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Previous studies found that compulsory licensing can reduce procurement prices for drugs, but it is unknown how the resulting prices compare to procurements through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; UNICEF; and other international channels. For this study we systematically constructed a case-study database of compulsory licensing activity for antiretrovirals and compared compulsory license prices to those in the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Global Price Reporting Mechanism and the Global Fund's Price and Quality Reporting Tool. Thirty compulsory license cases were analyzed with 673 comparable procurements from WHO and Global Fund data. Compulsory license prices exceeded the median international procurement prices in nineteen of the thirty case studies, often with a price gap of more than 25 percent. Compulsory licensing often delivered suboptimal value when compared to the alternative of international procurement, especially when used by low-income countries to manufacture medicines locally.

This has raised questions about the additional value of US cancer care derived from this additional spending. We calculated the number of US cancer deaths averted, compared to the situation in Western Europe, between 1982 and 2010 for twelve cancer types. We also assessed the value of US cancer care, compared to that in Western Europe, by estimating the ratio of additional spending on cancer to the number of quality-adjusted life-years saved. Compared to Western Europe, for three of the four costliest US cancers-breast, colorectal, and prostate-there were approximately 67,000, 265,000, and 60,000 averted US deaths, respectively, and for lung cancer there were roughly 1,120,000 excess deaths in the study period. The ratio of incremental cost to quality-adjusted life-years saved equaled $402,000 for breast cancer, $110,000 for colorectal cancer, and $1,979,000 for prostate cancer-amounts that exceed most accepted thresholds for cost-effective medical care. The United States lost quality-adjusted life-years despite additional spending for lung cancer: -$19,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved.

PPPs are now ubiquitous across the development spectrum. Yet while the narrative that the private sector must be engaged if complex health challenges are to be overcome is now dominant in development discourse, it does not yet appear to be shaping government approaches to addressing health inequalities within high-income welfare states such as Canada. This is significant as both the actions and inactions of firms factor heavily into why low-income Canadians face a disproportionate risk of developing diet-associated chronic diseases, such as type II diabetes. In the same ways PPPs have been an effective policy tool for strengthening public health in poor countries, this paper illuminates how the PPP model may have utility for mitigating poverty-associated food insecurity giving rise to diet-associated non-communicable diseases within the context of wealthy states.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The infection can be associated with acute symptomatic or asymptomatic hepatitis which can cause chronic inflammation of the liver and over years this can lead to cirrhosis and the development of hepatocellular carcinomas. Currently available therapeutics for chronically infected individuals aim at reducing viral replication and to slow down or stop the progression of the disease. Therefore, novel treatment options are needed to efficiently combat and eradicate this disease. Here we provide a state of the art overview of gene therapeutic approaches to inhibit HBV replication. We discuss non-viral and viral approaches which were explored to deliver therapeutic nucleic acids aiming at reducing HBV replication. Types of delivered therapeutic nucleic acids which were studied since many years include antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and antisense RNA, ribozymes and DNAzymes, RNA interference, and external guide sequences. More recently designer nucleases gained increased attention and were exploited to destroy the HBV genome. In addition we mention other strategies to reduce HBV replication based on delivery of DNA encoding dominant negative mutants and DNA vaccination. In combination with available cell culture and animal models for HBV infection, in vitro and in vivo studies can be performed to test efficacy of gene therapeutic approaches. Recent progress but also challenges will be specified and future perspectives will be discussed. This is an exciting time to explore such approaches because recent successes of gene therapeutic strategies in the clinic to treat genetic diseases raise hope to find alternative treatment options for patients chronically infected with HBV.",eng,World journal of hepatology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Amantadine and rimantadine are M2 proton channel blockers that inhibit virus uncoating; oseltamivir and zanamivir are neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors that inhibit virus release. However, recent years have witnessed a drastic increase in instances of drug resistance, and flu strains that are resistant to both classes of drugs have been reported. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop the next generation of anti-influenza drugs. Among a handful of anti-influenza drug targets, the viral fusion protein hemagglutinin (HA) is one of the most advanced. This review discusses the biological roles of HA during viral replication and highlights peptide- and small molecule-based HA inhibitors, including recent computationally designed HA binders. The text is organized into four sections based on the maturation stages of HA: inhibitors targeting the glycosylation of HA, the proteolytic activation of HA, the attachment of HA to host cell receptors, and peptide- and small molecule-based inhibitors targeting HA-mediated membrane fusion. Of particular interest are advances in the areas of developing dual inhibitors targeting both HA and NA and broad-spectrum HA inhibitors targeting both groups of HAs.",eng,Current medicinal chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The crucial role of oxidative stress in the initiation and progression of obesity leads to the hypothesis that antioxidants can be used as therapeutic agents for obesity treatment. Among antioxidants, much attention has been paid to polyphenols due to their negligible adverse effects. Among them, quercetin is one of the most common dietary antioxidants widely distributed in different plant materials, such as fruits, vegetables and cereals. Quercetin shows a wide range of biological and health-promoting effects, such as anticancer, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. Furthermore, quercetin has anti-obesity activity through mitogen-activated protein kinase and adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. In this study, we reviewed the available scientific reports concerning the beneficial role of quercetin against obesity with emphasis on its mechanisms of action.",eng,Food chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25721743,10.1016/j.bbr.2015.02.038,Evaluation of gait impairment in mice subjected to craniotomy and traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a significant global health burden and causes long-lasting neuromotor deficits, particularly in individuals who sustain severe TBI. A better understanding of gait impairment after experimental TBI will provide valuable information for the recovery and rehabilitation of TBI survivors. Here we utilised the DigiGait system to perform kinematic gait analysis in mice subjected to brain injury induced by the controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI model. Naïve mice, non-craniotomised and craniotomised mice were included as controls. The temporal and spatial profile of gait was mapped from 3h to 1-week post-TBI. Remarkably, there was a noticeable alteration in some aspects of gait in craniotomised sham mice from their pre-surgery baseline at various time-points over the testing period. This was not observed in naïve mice or non-craniotomised sham controls over the same time period. This finding indicates that the craniotomy procedure alone effects gait. When craniotomised mice were subjected to TBI, additional deleterious effects on gait function were observed, including forelimb stance and swing duration as well as left hindlimb swing and stride duration and frequency. Hence, mice subjected to CCI-induced TBI develop clear alterations in gait but part of this is attributable to the effect of craniotomy alone. This study also highlights the need to include both non-craniotomised and craniotomised sham mice as controls when undertaking the CCI-induced model of TBI, particularly when early time points are being evaluated.",eng,Behavioural brain research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Additional information was extracted from International Agency for Research on Cancer publications. A literature search was conducted to identify studies that reported additional information on data collection methods and provided 27 studies. The websites of the 10 largest funders of development assistance for health were searched for GLOBOCAN citations.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-six sub-Saharan African cancer registration systems submitting data to GLOBOCAN 2008 in relation to 21 countries.--NEW SECTION--Information on 15 quality variables were extracted and compared with the international gold standard for cancer registration systems.--NEW SECTION--Population coverage of the cancer registries ranged from from 2.3% of the population in Kenya to 100% in The Gambia, with a heavy urban bias in all countries. However, 20 countries (300 million people) had no cancer registration systems. Nineteen of the 26 registries failed to meet more than five of the 15 quality criteria and only one country met more than 10.

Results of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP)-14 questionnaire were considered as the dependent variable. A conceptual hierarchical data analysis model from distal to proximal determinants of the median OHIP-14 total score was adopted.--NEW SECTION--Analysis of the OHIP-14 domains and total score revealed several significant protector characteristics: younger age, academic education, no alcohol consumption, regular physical activity, fewer smoking pack years, routine dental attendance, and lower NRS scores. Routine dental attendance was related to lower NRS scores (P < 0.001) which in turn were associated with lower OHIP-14 scores (P = 0.018). Better health-related behaviors (P = 0.039) and routine dental attendance (P = 0.029) also correlated directly with lower OHIP-14 scores.--NEW SECTION--Better health-related behaviors and routine dental attendance have a protective effect on OHRQoL.

Yet, although both organisms cause pulmonary disease, M. tuberculosis is a global health menace, whereas M. kansasii is an opportunistic pathogen. To illuminate the differences between these organisms, we have sequenced the genome of M. kansasii ATCC 12478 and its plasmid (pMK12478) and conducted side-by-side in vitro and in vivo investigations of these two organisms. The M. kansasii genome is 6,432,277 bp, more than 2 Mb longer than that of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and the plasmid contains 144,951 bp. Pairwise comparisons reveal conserved and discordant genes and genomic regions. A notable example of genomic conservation is the virulence locus ESX-1, which is intact and functional in the low-virulence M. kansasii, potentially mediating phagosomal disruption. Differences between these organisms include a decreased predicted metabolic capacity, an increased proportion of toxin-antitoxin genes, and the acquisition of M. tuberculosis-specific genes in the pathogen since their common ancestor. Consistent with their distinct epidemiologic profiles, following infection of C57BL/6 mice, M. kansasii counts increased by less than 10-fold over 6 weeks, whereas M. tuberculosis counts increased by over 10,000-fold in just 3 weeks. Together, these data suggest that M. kansasii can serve as an image of the environmental ancestor of M. tuberculosis before its emergence as a professional pathogen, and can be used as a model organism to study the switch from an environmental opportunistic pathogen to a professional host-restricted pathogen.",eng,Genome biology and evolution,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, data are weak, and little is known about how people in the region perceive their health or their health care. We used data from the Gallup World Poll in 2012 to document sub-Saharan Africans' perceived health status, their satisfaction with health care, their contact with medical professionals, and the priority they attach to health care. In comparison to other regions of the world, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest ratings for well-being and the lowest satisfaction with health care. It also has the second-lowest perception of personal health, after only the former Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites. HIV prevalence is positively correlated with perceived improvements in health care in countries with high prevalence. This is consistent with an improvement in at least some health care services as a result of the largely aid-funded rollout of antiretroviral treatment. Even so, sub-Saharan Africans do not prioritize health care as a matter of policy, although donors are increasingly shifting their aid efforts in the region toward health.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

Although development of protective antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) is a common phenomenon after vaccination as well as natural infection, sometimes it does not appear even after complete vaccination. In the present study, whether the impairment of the development of anti-HBs in naturally infected and/or vaccinated populations is associated with immunomodulating risk factors (i.e., age, gender, smoking, and diabetes) and/or other risk factors (i.e., socioeconomic status, dental, and saloon exposure) was investigated through a cross-sectional study. Among 204 nonvaccinated patients, 132 (64.7%) tested positive for anti-HBc, indicating that they had been exposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) at least once in their lifetime. Exposure to HBV (anti-HBc positive) was significantly higher among low-income people, dental exposed, and saloon users. Among anti-HBc positive patients, only 44 (33.3%) developed natural immunity with anti-HBs. Impairment in anti-HBs formation was found to be significantly high among cigarette smokers. However, no significant association of anti-HBs development was observed with age, gender, socioeconomic status, diabetes, dental exposure, and using saloon. Consistently, the frequency of developing protective anti-HBs (≥10 IU/L) among a vaccinated population was almost nine times less among smokers. These data suggest that anti-HBs development, either naturally or after vaccination, is significantly lower among smokers. It emphasizes the need to check the anti-HBs status in smokers after vaccination, and a booster vaccination should be administered if the anti-HBs antibody titer decreases below the protective level.",eng,Viral immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Despite the enormous relevance of cirrhotic disease, pharmacological strategies for prevention or treatment of hepatic fibrosis are still limited, underlining the need to establish a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of hepatic cirrhosis. Recently, miRNAs have emerged as a new class of RNAs that do not withhold the information to encode for proteins but regulate whole gene expression networks during different physiological and pathological processes. Various authors demonstrated that miRNA species are functionally involved in the regulation of chronic liver damage and development of liver cirrhosis in inflamed livers. Moreover, circulating miRNA patterns were suggested to serve as blood-based biomarkers indicating liver injury and progression to hepatic cirrhosis and cancer. Here we summarize current findings on a potential role of miRNAs in the cascade leading from liver inflammation to liver fibrosis and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. We compare data from animal models with findings on miRNAs dysregulated in human patients and finally highlight a potential use of miRNAs as biomarkers for liver injury, fibrosis and cancer.",eng,Hepatobiliary surgery and nutrition,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Here, we compare prevalence of Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, in rodents across two land-use types-agricultural and conserved-in northern Tanzania. Estimated abundance of seropositive rodents nearly doubled in agricultural sites compared with conserved sites. This relationship between land-use type and abundance of seropositive rodents is likely mediated by changes in rodent and flea community composition, particularly via an increase in the abundance of the commensal species, Mastomys natalensis, in agricultural habitats. There was mixed support for rodent species diversity negatively impacting Y. pestis seroprevalence. Together, these results suggest that land-use change could affect the risk of local transmission of plague, and raise critical questions about transmission dynamics at the interface of conserved and agricultural habitats.

The Social-Cognitive Processing (SCP) model suggests that social constraints (i.e. limited opportunities to disclose thoughts and feelings in a supportive context) impede emotional and cognitive processing of stressful life events, which may lead to maladjustment. This study investigates personal and loss-related correlates of social constraints during bereavement, the links between social constraints and post-loss adjustment, and whether social constraints moderate the relations between loss-related intrusive thoughts and adjustment. A community sample of bereaved individuals (n = 238) provided demographic and loss-related information and reported on their social constraints, loss-related intrusions, and psychological and physical adjustment. Women, younger people, and those with greater financial concerns reported more social constraints. Social constraints were significantly associated with more depressive symptoms, perceived stress, somatic symptoms, and worse global health. Individuals with high social constraints and high loss-related intrusions had the highest depressive symptoms and perceived life stress. Consistent with the SCP model, loss-related social constraints are associated with poorer adjustment, especially psychological adjustment. In particular, experiencing social constraints in conjunction with loss-related intrusions may heighten the risk for poor psychological health.",eng,Applied psychology.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine in a case-control study and to assess the likelihood of bias in that study in a bias-indicator study.--NEW SECTION--Residents of Bocozel or Grand Saline who were eligible for the vaccination campaign (ie, age ≥12 months, not pregnant, and living in the region at the time of the vaccine campaign) were included. In the primary case-control study, cases had acute watery diarrhoea, sought treatment at one of three participating cholera treatment units, and had a stool sample positive for cholera by culture. For each case, four control individuals who did not seek treatment for acute watery diarrhoea were matched by location of residence, enrolment time (within 2 weeks of the case), and age (1-4 years, 5-15 years, and >15 years). Cases in the bias-indicator study were individuals with acute watery diarrhoea with a negative stool sample for cholera. Controls were selected in the same manner as in the primary case-control study. Trained staff used standard laboratory procedures to do rapid tests and stool cultures from study cases. Participants were interviewed to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics, risk factors for cholera, and self-reported vaccination. Data were analysed by conditional logistic regression, adjusting for matching factors.--NEW SECTION--From Oct 24, 2012, to March 9, 2014, 114 eligible individuals presented with acute watery diarrhoea and were enrolled, 25 of whom were subsequently excluded. 47 participants were analysed as cases in the vaccine effectiveness case-control study and 42 as cases in the bias-indicator study. 33 (70%) of 47 cholera cases self-reported vaccination versus 167 (89%) of 188 controls (vaccine effectiveness 63%, 95% CI 8-85). 27 (57%) of 47 cases had certified vaccination versus 147 (78%) of 188 controls (vaccine effectiveness 58%, 13-80). Neither self-reported nor verified vaccination was significantly associated with non-cholera diarrhoea (vaccine effectiveness 18%, 95% CI -208 to 78 by self-report and -21%, -238 to 57 by verified vaccination).--NEW SECTION--Bivalent whole-cell oral cholera vaccine effectively protected against cholera in Haiti from 4 months to 24 months after vaccination. Vaccination is an important component of efforts to control cholera epidemics.--NEW SECTION--National Institutes of Health, Delivering Oral Vaccines Effectively project, and Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School.",eng,The Lancet.

The goal of this study is to assess the surgical and anaesthesia capacity in Guyana. A survey tool adapted from the WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care was used to survey nine regional and district hospitals within the Ministry of Health system in Guyana. In nine hospitals across Guyana, there were an average of 0.7 obstetricians/gynaecologists, 3.5 non-OB surgeons, and 1 anaesthesiologist per hospital. District and regional hospitals performed an annual total of 1520 and 10,340 surgical cases, respectively. All but 2 district hospitals reported the ability to perform surgery. An average hospital has two operating rooms; 6 out of 9 hospitals reported routine medication shortages, and 4 out of 9 hospitals reported routine water or electricity shortages. Amongst the three regional hospitals, 16.1% of pregnancies resulted in Caesarean section.

A cross-cultural analysis among six developing countries.,"Utilizing a World Health Organization (WHO) multi-national dataset, the present study examined the relationships between emotion, affective variability (i.e., the fluctuation of emotional status), and depression across six developing countries, including China (N=15,050); Ghana (N=5,573); India (N=12,198); Mexico (N=5,448); South Africa (N=4,227); and Russia (N=4,947). Using moderated logistic regression and hierarchical multiple regression, the effects of emotion, affective variability, culture, and their interactions on depression and depressive symptoms were examined when statistically controlling for a number of external factors (i.e., age, gender, marital status, education level, income, smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet). The results revealed that negative emotion was a statistically significant predictor of depressive symptoms, but the strength of association was smaller in countries with a lower incidence of depression (i.e., China and Ghana). The association between negative affective variability and the risk of depression was higher in India and lower in Ghana. Findings suggested that culture not only was associated with the incidence of depression, but it could also moderate the effects of emotion and affective variability on depression or the experience of depressive symptoms.",eng,Journal of epidemiology and global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The ability of the parasite to rapidly develop resistance to therapeutics drives an urgent need for the delivery of new drugs. The Medicines for Malaria Venture have compounds known for their antimalarial activity, but not necessarily the molecular targets. In this study, we assess the ability of the ""MMV 400"" compounds to inhibit the activity of three metalloaminopeptidases from Plasmodium falciparum, PfA-M1, PfA-M17 and PfM18 AAP. We have developed a multiplex assay system to allow rapid primary screening of compounds against all three metalloaminopeptidases, followed by detailed analysis of promising compounds. Our results show that there were no PfM18AAP inhibitors, whereas two moderate inhibitors of the neutral aminopeptidases PfA-M1 and PfA-M17 were identified. Further investigation through structure-activity relationship studies and molecular docking suggest that these compounds are competitive inhibitors with novel binding mechanisms, acting through either non-classical zinc coordination or independently of zinc binding altogether. Although it is unlikely that inhibition of PfA-M1 and/or PfA-M17 is the primary mechanism responsible for the antiplasmodial activity reported for these compounds, their detailed characterization, as presented in this work, pave the way for their further optimization as a novel class of dual PfA-M1/PfA-M17 inhibitors utilising non-classical zinc binding groups.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The total global health impact of human infectious diseases associated with pathogenic microorganisms from land-based wastewater pollution was estimated to be approximately three million disability-adjusted life years (DALY), with an estimated economic loss of nearly 12 billion US dollars per year. Although clean water is essential for healthy living, it is not equally granted to all humans. Indeed, people who live in developing countries are challenged every day by an inadequate supply of clean water. Polluted water can lead to health crises that in turn spread waterborne pathogens. Taking measures to assess the water quality can prevent these potential risks. Thus, a pressing need has emerged in developing countries for comprehensive and accurate assessments of water quality.

Depression is a heterogeneous disorder and current methods for assessing its severity in clinical practice rely on symptom count, however this approach is unreliable and inconsistent. The clinical evaluation of depressive symptoms is particularly challenging in primary care, where the majority of patients with depression are managed, due to the presence of co-morbidities. Current methods for risk assessment of depression do not accurately predict treatment response or clinical outcomes. Several biological pathways have been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression; however, accurate and predictive biomarkers remain elusive. We conducted a systematic review of the published evidence supporting the use of peripheral biomarkers to predict outcomes in depression, using Medline and Embase. Peripheral biomarkers in depression were found to be statistically significant predictors of mental health outcomes such as treatment response, poor outcome and symptom remission; and physical health outcomes such as increased incidence of cardiovascular events and deaths, and all-cause mortality. However, the available evidence has multiple methodological limitations which must be overcome to make any real clinical progress. Despite extensive research on the relationship of depression with peripheral biomarkers, its translational application in practice remains uncertain. In future, peripheral biomarkers identified with novel techniques and combining multiple biomarkers may have a potential role in depression risk assessment but further research is needed in this area.",eng,Frontiers in human neuroscience,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The search for new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of lung cancer is important. Here, we reported that the AKT inhibitor perifosine and the MEK\ERK inhibitor MEK-162 synergistically induced lung cancer cell (A549 and H460 lines) growth inhibition and apoptosis. The combined efficiency was significantly higher than either agent alone. For the molecular study, perifosine and MEK-162 worked together to concurrently block AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), and MEK-ERK signalings in lung cancer cells, while either agent alone only affected one or two signalings with lower efficiency. In vivo, MEK-162 and perifosine co-administration dramatically inhibited A549 lung cancer xenograft growth, without inducing apparent toxicities. The synergistic activity in vivo was again superior than either agent alone. Thus, perifosine and MEK-162 combination is biologically plausible by acting through effects on different proliferation and survival-related signaling pathways.

The effectiveness of screening depends on several factors, including pathogen natural history and epidemiology, human behavior, and characteristics of the source epidemic. We developed a mathematical model to understand how these factors combine to influence screening outcomes. We analyzed screening programs for six emerging pathogens in the early and late stages of an epidemic. We show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance. For pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage.

The magnitude of the effect of chronic kidney disease on incident stroke seems to be higher in persons of Asian ethnicity. Since the kidney and brain share unique susceptibilities to vascular injury due to similar anatomical and functional features of small artery diseases, kidney impairment can be predictive of the presence and severity of cerebral small vessel diseases. Chronic kidney disease has been reported to be associated with silent brain infarcts, cerebral white matter lesions, and cerebral microbleeds, independently of vascular risk factors. In addition, chronic kidney disease affects cognitive function, partly via the high prevalence of cerebral small vessel diseases. Retinal artery disease also has an independent relationship with chronic kidney disease and cognitive impairment. Stroke experts are no longer allowed to be ignorant of chronic kidney disease.

25690046,10.1017/dmp.2015.26,Global Health Security Demands a Strong International Health Regulations Treaty and Leadership From a Highly Resourced World Health Organization.,"If the Ebola tragedy of West Africa has taught us anything, it should be that the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR) Treaty, which gave unprecedented authority to the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide global public health security during public health emergencies of international concern, has fallen severely short of its original goal. After encouraging successes with the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic, the intent of the legally binding Treaty to improve the capacity of all countries to detect, assess, notify, and respond to public health threats has shamefully lapsed. Despite the granting of 2-year extensions in 2012 to countries to meet core surveillance and response requirements, less than 20% of countries have complied. Today it is not realistic to expect that these gaps will be solved or narrowed in the foreseeable future by the IHR or the WHO alone under current provisions. The unfortunate failures that culminated in an inadequate response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa are multifactorial, including funding, staffing, and poor leadership decisions, but all are reversible. A rush by the Global Health Security Agenda partners to fill critical gaps in administrative and operational areas has been crucial in the short term, but questions remain as to the real priorities of the G20 as time elapses and critical gaps in public health protections and infrastructure take precedence over the economic and security needs of the developed world. The response from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and foreign medical teams to Ebola proved indispensable to global health security, but both deserve stronger strategic capacity support and institutional status under the WHO leadership granted by the IHR Treaty. Treaties are the most successful means the world has in preventing, preparing for, and controlling epidemics in an increasingly globalized world. Other options are not sustainable. Given the gravity of ongoing failed treaty management, the slow and incomplete process of reform, the magnitude and complexity of infectious disease outbreaks, and the rising severity of public health emergencies, a recommitment must be made to complete and restore the original mandates as a collaborative and coordinated global network responsibility, not one left to the actions of individual countries. The bottom line is that the global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system. As such, this Treaty has the potential to become one of the most effective treaties for crisis response and risk reduction worldwide. Practitioners and health decision-makers worldwide must break their silence and advocate for a stronger Treaty and a return of WHO authority.",eng,Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

H7N9 viruses are able to bind to human sialic acid receptors and are also able to develop resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors without a loss in fitness. It is not clear whether prior exposure to circulating human influenza viruses or influenza vaccination confers immunity to H7N9 strains. Here, we demonstrate that 3 of 83 H3 HA-reactive monoclonal antibodies generated by individuals that had previously undergone influenza A virus vaccination were able to neutralize H7N9 viruses and protect mice against homologous challenge. The H7N9-neutralizing antibodies bound to the HA stalk domain but exhibited a difference in their breadth of reactivity to different H7 influenza subtypes. Mapping viral escape mutations suggested that these antibodies bind at least two different epitopes on the stalk region. Together, these results indicate that these broadly neutralizing antibodies may contribute to the development of therapies against H7N9 strains and may also be effective against pathogenic H7 strains that emerge in the future.",eng,The Journal of clinical investigation,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

T2DM is a global health problem. The rapid rise in its prevalence in the Arab and Bedouin populations in Israel is responsible for their lower life expectancy compared to Israeli Jews. The increased prevalence of T2DM corresponds to increased rates of obesity in these populations. A major risk group is adult Arab women aged 55-64 years. In this group obesity reaches 70%. There are several genetic and nutritional explanations for this increase. We found high hospitalization rates for micro and macrovascular complications among diabetic patients of Arab and Bedouin origin. Despite the high prevalence of diabetes and its negative health implications, there is evidence that care and counseling relating to nutrition, physical activity and self-examination of the feet are unsatisfactory. Economic difficulties are frequently cited as the reason for inadequate medical care. Other proposed reasons include faith in traditional therapy and misconceptions about drugs and their side effects. In Israel, the quality indicators program is based on one of the world's leading information systems and deals with the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. The program's baseline data pointed to health inequality between minority populations and the general population in several areas, including monitoring and control of diabetes. Based on these data, a pilot intervention program was planned, aimed at minority populations. This program led to a decrease in inequality and served as the basis for a broader, more comprehensive intervention that has entered the implementation stage. Interventions that were shown to be effective in other Arabic countries may serve as models for diabetes management in the Arab and Bedouin populations in Israel.",eng,World journal of diabetes,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

29061927,10.3390/vetsci2010023,A Physician's View of One Health: Challenges and Opportunities.,"One Health is one of the most important movements and emerging concepts in health today. The convergence of the fields of human and animal medicine has the potential to generate novel scientific hypotheses, create effective new therapies and potentially transform how physicians, veterinarians and their patients understand health and disease. Despite this potential, One Health has not yet gained significant awareness or traction in human medical communities. From its inception, One Health, sometimes also called One Medicine, has been piloted primarily by leaders from the world of veterinary medicine. Although the specific term was coined perhaps 10 years ago, comparative medicine has been quietly evident on university campuses with veterinary and medical schools for decades longer. Although a few physicians have played major leadership roles in One Health, in the United States, despite over ten years of the movement's robust growth, many have still not heard of it. Furthermore, physicians with some awareness of One Health often believe it to be primarily and exclusively about zoonotic infections and global health. The much broader scope and potential of One Health as also including comparative physiology and medicine is not being communicated effectively. Consequently, the human medical community remains largely disengaged. This is problematic because without significant engagement from physicians, nurses and other human health care professionals, the potential of One Health cannot be realized. To advance One Health it is imperative that we first understand the roots of under-engagement of the human medical community.

Recently, it has been known that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may act as an exogenous factor to enhance cancer progression. Triclosan (TCS) and 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1) were reported to bioaccumulate in human bodies through the skin absorption. However, there has been insufficient evidence on the findings that the intervention of EDCs may promote the cancer progression in PCa. In the present study, to verify the risk of TCS and BP-1 to a PCa progression, cancer cell proliferation and migration were investigated in LNCaP PCa cells. TCS and BP-1 increased LNCaP cell proliferative activity and migration as did dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This phenomenon was reversed by the treatment with bicalutamide, a well known AR antagonist, suggesting that TCS and BP-1 acted as a xenoandrogen in LNCaP cells via AR signaling pathway by mimicking the action of DHT. A Western blot assay was performed to identify the alterations in the translational levels of cell growth- and metastasis-related markers, i.e., c-fos, cyclin E, p21, and cathepsin D genes. The expressions of genes related with G1/S transition of cell cycle and metastasis were increased by DHT, TCS, and BP-1, while the expression of p21 protein responsible for cell cycle arrest was reduced by DHT, TCS, and BP-1. Taken together, these results indicated that TCS and BP-1 may enhance the progression of PCa by regulating cell cycle and metastasis-related genes via AR signaling pathway.",eng,Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25680362,10.1093/heapro/dav003,A community-engaged infection prevention and control approach to Ebola.,"The real missing link in Ebola control efforts to date may lie in the failure to apply core principles of health promotion: the early, active and sustained engagement of affected communities, their trusted leaders, networks and lay knowledge, to help inform what local control teams do, and how they may better do it, in partnership with communities. The predominant focus on viral transmission has inadvertently stigmatized and created fear-driven responses among affected individuals, families and communities. While rigorous adherence to standard infection prevention and control (IPC) precautions and safety standards for Ebola is critical, we may be more successful if we validate and combine local community knowledge and experiences with that of IPC medical teams. In an environment of trust, community partners can help us learn of modest adjustments that would not compromise safety but could improve community understanding of, and responses to, disease control protocol, so that it better reflects their 'community protocol' (local customs, beliefs, knowledge and practices) and concerns. Drawing on the experience of local experts in several African nations and of community-engaged health promotion leaders in the USA, Canada and WHO, we present an eight step model, from entering communities with cultural humility, though reciprocal learning and trust, multi-method communication, development of the joint protocol, to assessing progress and outcomes and building for sustainability. Using examples of changes that are culturally relevant yet maintain safety, we illustrate how often minor adjustments can help prevent and treat the most serious emerging infectious disease since HIV/AIDS.",eng,Health promotion international,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The aim of this study was to systematically review the existing data informing current understanding of the prevalence of Chagas disease in LA migrants living in European countries.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting prevalence of Chagas disease in European countries belonging to the European Union (EU) before 2004 in accordance with the MOOSE guidelines and based on the database sources MEDLINE and Global Health. No restrictions were placed on study date, study design or language of publication. The pooled prevalence was estimated using random effect models based on DerSimonian & Laird method.--NEW SECTION--We identified 18 studies conducted in five European countries. The random effect pooled prevalence was 4.2% (95%CI:2.2-6.7%); and the heterogeneity of Chagas disease prevalence among studies was high (I2 = 97%,p<0.001). Migrants from Bolivia had the highest prevalence of Chagas disease (18.1%, 95%CI:13.9-22.7%).--NEW SECTION--Prevalence of Chagas in LA migrants living in Europe is high, particularly in migrants from Bolivia and Paraguay. Data are highly heterogeneous dependent upon country of origin and within studies of migrants from the same country of origin.

As a leading cause of hospitalizations among patients aged 65 years or older, HF is a major consumer of healthcare resources, creating a substantial strain on the healthcare system. This paper discusses the epidemiology of HF, financial impact, and multifaceted predicaments in end-stage HF care. A search was conducted on the U.S. National Library of Medicine website (www.pubmed.gov) using keywords such as end-stage heart failure, palliative care, ethical dilemmas. Despite the poor prognosis of HF (worse than that for many cancers), many HF patients, caregivers, and clinicians are unaware of the poor prognosis. In addition, the unpredictable clinical trajectory of HF complicates the planning of end-of-life care, such as palliative care and hospice, leading to underutilization of such resources. In conclusion, ethical dilemmas in end-stage HF are numerous, embroiling not only the patient, but also the caregiver, healthcare team, and society.",eng,Journal of geriatric cardiology : JGC,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The discovery of new compounds with anti-MDR TB efficacy and favorable metabolism profiles is an important scientific challenge. Using computational biology and ligand docking data, we have conceived a multifunctional molecule, 2, as a potential anti-MDR TB agent. This compound was produced through a multi-step synthesis. It exhibited significant in vitro activity against MDR-TB (MIC 1.56μg/mL) and its half-life (t1/2) in human liver microsomes was 14.4h. The metabolic profiles of compound 2 with respect to human cytochrome P450 (CYP) and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isozymes were favorable.

Power that is not based on financial strength but on knowledge or experience, is difficult to estimate, and yet it may provide the legitimacy to make moral claims on what is, or ought to be, on global health agendas. Twenty years ago power was exercised in a much less complex health environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) was able to exert its authority as world health leader. The landscape today is very different. Financial resources for global health are being competed for by diverse organisations, and power is diffused and somewhat hidden in such a climate, where each organization has to establish and make its own moral claims loudly and publicly. We observe two ways which allow actors to capture moral authority in global health. One, through power based on scientific knowledge and two, through procedures in the policy process, most commonly associated with the notion of broad consultation and participation. We discuss these drawing on one particular framework provided by Bourdieu, who analyses the source of actor power by focusing on different sorts of capital. Different approaches or theories to understanding power will go some way to answering the challenge Shiffman throws to health policy analysts. We need to explore much more fully where power lies in global health, and how it is exercised in order to understand underlying health agendas and claims to legitimacy made by global health actors today.",eng,International journal of health policy and management,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, the main hurdle is diminishing economic incentives. Increased global calls to minimize the overuse of antibiotics, the cost of meeting regulatory requirements and the low prices of currently marketed antibiotics are strong deterrents to antibacterial drug development programmes. New economic models that create incentives for the discovery of new antibiotics and yet reconcile these incentives with responsible antibiotic use are long overdue.

Our objective was to assess the reliability, construct validity and responsiveness to change of the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) in patients with early dcSSc participating in a multicentre prospective study.--NEW SECTION--At enrolment and 1 year, patients completed the SGRQ (a multi-item instrument with four scales: symptoms, activity, impact and total), a visual analogue scale (VAS) for breathing and the HAQ Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and underwent 6 min walk distance and pulmonary function tests, physician and patient global health assessments and high-resolution CT (HRCT). We assessed internal consistency reliability using Cronbach's α. For validity we examined the ability of the SGRQ to differentiate the presence vs absence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) on HRCT or restrictive lung disease and evaluated the 1 year responsiveness to change using pulmonary function tests and patient- and physician-reported anchors. Correlation coefficients of 0.24-0.36 were considered moderate and >0.37 was considered large.--NEW SECTION--A total of 177 patients were evaluated. Reliability was satisfactory for all SGRQ scales (0.70-0.93). All scales showed large correlations with the VAS for breathing and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide in the overall cohort and in the subgroup with ILD.

There is a need to discover newer cost-effective alternatives for current therapeutic regimes. Mango kernel is a waste product with potential as a source of anti-cancer phytochemicals, especially since it is non-toxic towards normal breast cell lines at concentrations for which it induces cell death in breast cancer cells. In this study, the anti-cancer effect of mango kernel extract was determined on estrogen receptor-positive human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cells. The MCF-7 cells were cultured and treated with 5, 10 and 50 μg/mL of mango kernel extract for 12 and 24 h.

In many disasters (both natural and man-made) hundreds-and in major earthquakes, thousands-of lives are lost in the first days following the event because of the lack of medical/surgical facilities to treat those with potentially survivable injuries. Disasters disrupt and destroy not only medical facilities in the disaster zone but also infrastructure (roads, airports, electricity) and potentially local healthcare personnel as well. To minimize morbidity and mortality from disasters, medical treatment must begin immediately, within minutes ideally, but certainly within 24 h (not the days to weeks currently seen in medical response to disasters). This requires that all resources-medical equipment and support, and healthcare personnel-be portable and readily available; transport to the disaster site will usually require helicopters, as military medical response teams in developed countries have demonstrated.

However, several studies have documented the uptake of several toxicants and carcinogens during WPS that is strongly associated with harmful health effects. This paper reviews the literature on the health effects of WPS.--NEW SECTION--Three databases-PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE-were searched until August 2014 for the acute and long-term health effects of WPS using the terms 'waterpipe' and its synonyms (hookah, shisha, goza, narghileh, arghileh and hubble-bubble) in various spellings.--NEW SECTION--We included original clinical studies, case reports and systematic reviews and focused on clinical human studies. ∼10% of the identified studies met the selection criteria.--NEW SECTION--Data were abstracted by all three authors and summarised into tables. Abstracted data included study type, results and methodological limitations and were analysed jointly by all three authors.--NEW SECTION--WPS acutely leads to increased heart rate, blood pressure, impaired pulmonary function and carbon monoxide intoxication. Chronic bronchitis, emphysema and coronary artery disease are serious complications of long-term use. Lung, gastric and oesophageal cancer are associated with WPS as well as periodontal disease, obstetrical complications, osteoporosis and mental health problems.--NEW SECTION--Contrary to the widely held misconception, WPS is associated with a variety of adverse short-term and long-term health effects that should reinforce the need for stronger regulation. In addition, this review highlights the limitations of the published work, which is mostly cross-sectional or retrospective. Prospective studies should be undertaken to assess the full spectrum of health effects of WPS, particularly in view of its growing popularity and attractiveness to youth.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

These are blebs of outer membrane and periplasm, shed from the surface of living Gram-negative bacteria following the targeted deletion of proteins involved in maintaining the integrity of the inner and outer membranes. The current study investigates the use of GMMA as starting material for extraction of membrane components, focusing on the O-antigen polysaccharide portion of lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella Typhimurium. We show that the amount of O-antigen extracted from GMMA by acid hydrolysis is comparable to the quantity extracted from whole wild type bacteria, but with less protein and DNA contaminants. Compared to conventional purification, GMMA enabled a reduction in the number of purification steps required to obtain the O-antigen polysaccharide with the same purity. Purification processes from GMMA and bacteria were characterised by similar final yields. Use of GMMA as starting material provides the possibility to simplify the purification process of O-antigen, with a consequent decrease in manufacturing costs of O-antigen-based glyconjugate vaccines against Salmonella strains and potentially other Gram-negative bacteria.",eng,Journal of biotechnology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Differences in the RRT incidence, prevalence, and modality vary between regions and countries for reasons yet to be clarified.--NEW SECTION--Gain a better understanding of the association between hemodialysis (HD)-related variables and general population global health indicators.--NEW SECTION--The present study included prevalent HD patients from 27 countries/regions from the monitoring dialysis outcomes (MONDO) database from 2006-2011. Global population health indicators were obtained from the 2014 World Health Organization report and the Human Development Index from the Human Development Report Office 2014. The Spearman rank test was used to assess the correlations between population social economic indicators and HD variables.--NEW SECTION--A total of 84,796 prevalent HD patients were included. Their mean age was 63 (country mean 52-71), and 60% were males (country mean 52-85%). Significant correlations were found between HD demographic clusters and population education, wealth, mortality, and health indicators. The cluster of nutrition and inflammation variables were also highly correlated with population mortality, wealth, and health indicators. Finally, cardiovascular, fluid management, and dialysis adequacy clusters were associated with education, wealth, and health care resource indicators.--NEW SECTION--We identified socioeconomic indicators that were correlated with dialysis variables.

The published literature was searched systematically for evidence of what medical records have been used by FMTs in SODs. Findings The style and content of medical records kept by FMTs in SODs varied widely according to the published literature. Similarly, there was great variability in practice as to what happens to the record and/or the data from the record following its use during a patient encounter. However, there was a paucity of published work comprehensively detailing the exact content of records used. Interpretation Without standardization of the content of medical records kept by FMTs in SODs, it is difficult to ensure robust follow-up arrangements are documented. This may hinder communication between different FMTs and local medical teams (LMTs)/other FMTs who may then need to provide follow-up care for an individual. Furthermore, without a standard method of reporting data, there is an inaccurate picture of the work carried out. Therefore, there is not a solid evidence base for improving the quality of future response to SODs. Further research targeting FMTs and LMTs directly is essential to inform any development of an internationally agreed minimum data set (MDS), for both recording and reporting, in order that FMTs can reach the World Health Organization (WHO) standards for FMT practice.",eng,Prehospital and disaster medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In areas with arsenic contamination of water sources, such as China, Pakistan, Myanmar, Cambodia and especially Bangladesh and West Bengal, large populations are at risk of arsenic-induced skin cancer. Arsenic acts as a co-carcinogen with ultraviolet (UV) radiation and affects DNA damage and repair. Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) reduces premalignant keratoses in sun-damaged skin, likely by prevention of UV-induced cellular energy depletion and enhancement of DNA repair. We investigated whether nicotinamide modifies DNA repair following exposure to UV radiation and sodium arsenite. HaCaT keratinocytes and ex vivo human skin were exposed to 2μM sodium arsenite and low dose (2J/cm2) solar-simulated UV, with and without nicotinamide supplementation. DNA photolesions in the form of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were detected by immunofluorescence. Arsenic exposure significantly increased levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine in irradiated cells. Nicotinamide reduced both types of photolesions in HaCaT keratinocytes and in ex vivo human skin, likely by enhancing DNA repair. These results demonstrate a reduction of two different photolesions over time in two different models in UV and arsenic exposed cells. Nicotinamide is a nontoxic, inexpensive agent with potential for chemoprevention of arsenic induced skin cancer.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Mechanisms of genetic susceptibility to ozone-induced lung inflammation are not completely understood. We hypothesized that Notch3 and Notch4 are important determinants of susceptibility to ozone-induced lung inflammation.--NEW SECTION--Wild-type (WT), Notch3 (Notch3-/-), and Notch4 (Notch4-/-) knockout mice were exposed to ozone (0.3 ppm) or filtered air for 6-72 hr.--NEW SECTION--Relative to air-exposed controls, ozone increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein, a marker of lung permeability, in all genotypes, but significantly greater concentrations were found in Notch4-/- compared with WT and Notch3-/- mice. Significantly greater mean numbers of BALF neutrophils were found in Notch3-/- and Notch4-/- mice compared with WT mice after ozone exposure. Expression of whole lung Tnf was significantly increased after ozone in Notch3-/- and Notch4-/- mice, and was significantly greater in Notch3-/- compared with WT mice. Statistical analyses of the transcriptome identified differentially expressed gene networks between WT and knockout mice basally and after ozone, and included Trim30, a member of the inflammasome pathway, and Traf6, an inflammatory signaling member.--NEW SECTION--These novel findings are consistent with Notch3 and Notch4 as susceptibility genes for ozone-induced lung injury, and suggest that Notch receptors protect against innate immune inflammation.",eng,Environmental health perspectives,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The purpose of this study was to identify and describe country and region-specific patterns of radiotherapy (RT) facilities in LMIC.--NEW SECTION--A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. A search strategy was developed to include articles on radiation capacity in LMIC from the following databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Global Health, and the Latin American and Caribbean System on Health Sciences Information. Searches included all literature up to April 2013.--NEW SECTION--A total of 49 articles were included in the review. Studies reviewed were divided into one of four regions: Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America. The African continent has the least amount of resources for RT. Furthermore, a wide disparity exists, as 60% of all machines on the continent are concentrated in Egypt and South Africa while 29 countries in Africa are still lacking any RT resource. A significant heterogeneity also exists across Southeast Asia despite a threefold increase in megavoltage teletherapy machines from 1976 to 1999, which corresponds with a rise in economic status. In LMIC of the Americas, only Uruguay met the International Atomic Energy Agency recommendations of 4 MV/million population, whereas Bolivia and Venezuela had the most radiation oncologists (>1 per 1000 new cancer cases). The main concern with the review of RT resources in Eastern Europe was the lack of data.--NEW SECTION--There is a dearth of publications on RT therapy infrastructure in LMIC. However, based on limited published data, availability of RT resources reflects the countries' economic status. The challenges to delivering radiation in the discussed regions are multidimensional and include lack of physical resources, lack of human personnel, and lack of data. Furthermore, access to existing RT and affordability of care remains a large problem.",eng,Frontiers in oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2014

The aim of this study is to investigate the association between outdoor pollutants and cardiovascular diseases among adults in Lebanon and to examine the possible moderator effect of cigarette smoking status on this association. A multicenter case-control study was conducted between October 2011 and October 2012. Cases were hospitalized patients diagnosed with CVD by a cardiologist while the control group subjects were free of any cardiac diseases. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, tobacco consumption, self-rated global health, pollution exposure, and other risk factors was collected using a questionnaire. The results of the logistic regression revealed that living near busy highway (OR 5.04, 95% CI (4.44-12.85), P < 0.001) and close to local diesel generator (OR 4.76, 95% CI (2.07-10.91), P < 0.001) was significantly associated with CVD.

Given the considerable need for specialists in underserved areas, some surgical residency programs offer international health electives in resource-poor settings to augment resident training. This study aims to quantify and to characterize international health elective opportunities among orthopaedic surgery residency programs across the United States.--NEW SECTION--A web-based survey was distributed to program directors and program coordinators of the 154 U.S. orthopaedic surgery residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Questions assessed the availability and characteristics of international health electives, the barriers to offering opportunities, and the opinions of program directors regarding the value of international health electives in orthopaedic surgery training.--NEW SECTION--Seventy-three orthopaedic surgery residency programs (47.4% response rate) responded to the survey, with twenty-four responses from program directors and forty-nine responses from program coordinators. Nineteen programs (26.0%) offer international elective training opportunities. Fifty programs had notable barriers to offering international electives. These barriers included lack of training time (thirty-seven programs [74%]), lack of funding (thirty-five programs [70%]), and lack of an international partner to facilitate an international health elective (seventeen programs [34%]). Directors of programs that offer international health electives compared with directors of programs that do not offer these electives felt more strongly that international health electives are important in residency training (mean Likert scale score of 4.2 compared with 2.65; p = 0.00195), that international health electives are valuable for residents (mean Likert scale score of 4.6 compared with 3.53; p = 0.0265), and that exposure to international health care should be required during residency training (mean Likert scale score of 3.0 compared with 1.65; p = 0.0194).--NEW SECTION--A minority of the orthopaedic surgery residency programs that participated in this study offers international health elective opportunities to trainees.

While global health training guidelines emphasize the importance of developing ethical and cultural competencies before embarking on fieldwork, their practical implementation is often lacking and consists mainly of recommendations regarding professional behavior and discussions of case studies. Evidence suggests that one of the most effective ways to teach certain skills in global health, including ethical and cultural competencies, is through service learning. This approach combines community service with experiential learning. Unfortunately, this approach to global health ethics training is often unattainable due to a lack of supervision and resources available at host locations. This often means that trainees enter global health initiatives unprepared to deal with ethical dilemmas, which has the potential for adverse consequences for patients and host institutions, thus contributing to growing concerns about exploitation and ""medical tourism."" From an educational perspective, exposure alone to such ethical dilemmas does not contribute to learning, due to lack of proper guidance.

A significant proportion of the world's population does not have adequate calcium intake, and thus, supplementation plays a key role in maintaining bone homeostasis and other aspects of health. Since a series of reports from the Auckland calcium study and meta-analysis indicated that calcium supplementation was associated with an increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events, concern over the safety of calcium supplementation has grown; however, considerable inconsistencies in the reproducibility were found and questions regarding the study methodologies have been raised. In addition, since the increased adverse cardiovascular events by calcium supplementation were observed in calcium-replete subjects, it should be clarified whether the same risk profile would be observed in countries with low calcium intake. Dietary calcium intake varies widely across the world; cardiovascular event risk factors and outcomes also vary and appear to be the opposite of calcium intake levels. Furthermore, the effects of calcium supplementation were shown to depend on dietary calcium intake, with a better bone mineral density response for low calcium intake subjects compared to that in calcium-replete subjects. Based on these evidences, the risk-benefit ratio of calcium supplement is likely to be different in different region of the world.

While innovation is important to all areas of health research, it is uniquely important in antibiotics. Resistance destroys the fruit of prior research, making it necessary to constantly innovate to avoid falling back into a pre-antibiotic era. But investment is declining in antibiotics, driven by competition from older antibiotics, the cost and uncertainty of the development process, and limited reimbursement incentives. Good public health practices curb inappropriate antibiotic use, making return on investment challenging in payment systems based on sales volume. We assess the impact of recent initiatives to improve antibiotic innovation, reflecting experience with all sixty-seven new molecular entity antibiotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration since 1980. Our analysis incorporates data and insights derived from several multistakeholder initiatives under way involving governments and the private sector on both sides of the Atlantic. We propose three specific reforms that could revitalize innovations that protect public health, while promoting long-term sustainability: increased incentives for antibiotic research and development, surveillance, and stewardship; greater targeting of incentives to high-priority public health needs, including reimbursement that is delinked from volume of drug use; and enhanced global collaboration, including a global treaty.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25645827,10.1128/AAC.04564-14,ω-Hydroxyemodin limits staphylococcus aureus quorum sensing-mediated pathogenesis and inflammation.,"Antibiotic-resistant pathogens are a global health threat. Small molecules that inhibit bacterial virulence have been suggested as alternatives or adjuncts to conventional antibiotics, as they may limit pathogenesis and increase bacterial susceptibility to host killing. Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of invasive skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in both the hospital and community settings, and it is also becoming increasingly antibiotic resistant. Quorum sensing (QS) mediated by the accessory gene regulator (agr) controls virulence factor production essential for causing SSTIs. We recently identified ω-hydroxyemodin (OHM), a polyhydroxyanthraquinone isolated from solid-phase cultures of Penicillium restrictum, as a suppressor of QS and a compound sought for the further characterization of the mechanism of action. At concentrations that are nontoxic to eukaryotic cells and subinhibitory to bacterial growth, OHM prevented agr signaling by all four S. aureus agr alleles. OHM inhibited QS by direct binding to AgrA, the response regulator encoded by the agr operon, preventing the interaction of AgrA with the agr P2 promoter. Importantly, OHM was efficacious in a mouse model of S. aureus SSTI. Decreased dermonecrosis with OHM treatment was associated with enhanced bacterial clearance and reductions in inflammatory cytokine transcription and expression at the site of infection. Furthermore, OHM treatment enhanced the immune cell killing of S. aureus in vitro in an agr-dependent manner. These data suggest that bacterial disarmament through the suppression of S. aureus QS may bolster the host innate immune response and limit inflammation.",eng,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The purpose of this article is to examine the sociopolitical and economic conditions that created the environment for the Ebola epidemic to occur, identify challenges to and opportunities for the prevention and control of Ebola and future outbreaks, and discuss policy recommendations and priority areas for addressing the Ebola epidemic and future outbreaks in West Africa. Articles in peer-reviewed journals on health system reforms in developing countries and periodicals of international organizations were used to gather the overview reported in this article. We identify individual, structural, and community challenges that must be addressed in an effort to reduce the spread of Ebola in West Africa. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa underscores the need for the overhaul and transformation of African health care systems to build the capacity in these countries to address infectious diseases.

Standardized protocols were used to measure weight and height. Underweight was defined as body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m(2) and overweight as BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2).--NEW SECTION--From the 1990s to the early 2000s, most countries were making progress on decreasing the prevalence of underweight, especially in rural areas. Although many countries continued to make progress more recently, several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that previously had a decreasing prevalence of underweight now have an increasing prevalence of underweight. For example, in rural areas of Senegal, the prevalence of underweight decreased 0.23% annually between 1992 and 2005, then increased 1.60% annually between 2005 and 2010. Meanwhile, the prevalence of overweight is increasing in nearly all countries, and in approximately half of all countries, the rate of increase is greater in rural areas than in urban areas. Although underweight persists as more prevalent than overweight in rural areas of many East Asian, South Asian, and Sub-Saharan African countries, the ratio of underweight to overweight in many countries has decreased over time, indicating that this trend is reversing.--NEW SECTION--Select countries in Sub-Saharan Africa may be more susceptible to food crises and should be targets for intervention. At the same time, global health efforts need to focus on preventing overweight, particularly in rural areas, which are quickly catching up to their urban counterparts.",eng,The Journal of nutrition,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Since 2004, the Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research (CCGHR) has facilitated annual Summer Institutes for new global health researchers aimed at strengthening global health research competencies and partnerships among participants. We sought to explore CCGHR Summer Institute alumni perspectives on the Summer Institute experience, particularly on the individual research pairings of Canadian and low- and middle-income countries researchers that have characterised the program. The results reveal that the Summer Institute offered an enriching learning opportunity for participants and worked to further their collaborative projects through providing dedicated one-on-one time with their international research partner, feedback from colleagues from around the world and mentorship by more senior researchers. Positive individual relationships among researchers, as well as the existence of institutional collaborations, employer and funding support, and agendas of local and national politicians were factors that have influenced the ongoing collaboration of partners.

We provide a historical overview of insurance as an emerging global health panacea and then offer brief assessments of three high-profile attempts to provide universal health coverage. Considerable research on health insurance in LMICs has been quantitative and focused on a limited set of outcomes. To advance the field, we identify eight productive areas for future ethnographic research that will add depth to our understanding of the social life and impact of health insurance in LMICs.

Childhood pneumonia is a significant global health problem affecting 150 million children worldwide. Sequelae of pulmonary infections potentially requiring surgery include bronchiectasis, lung abscess, pneumatocele, and empyema. Trauma, congenital conditions such as cystic fibrosis and iatrogenic injuries can result in pneumothoraces, chylothoraces, or bronchopleural fistulae. Recurrence rates for spontaneous pneumothorax treated non-operatively in pediatric patients approach 50-60%. Chylothoraces in newborns may occur spontaneously or due to birth trauma, whereas in older children the etiology is almost always iatrogenic.

32680324,10.1111/camh.12083,Editorial Commentary: An agenda for global child mental health.,"Even as mental health has become increasingly recognized as a key issue in global health, child mental health has largely remained in its shadows. This is possibly because many interventions for child mental health lie outside the realm of narrowly defined biomedical interventions and platforms, with the majority of interventions targeting psychological and social mechanisms and a strong emphasis on prevention. This situation must change, however, as child mental health interventions have potentially the greatest impact on the burden of mental disorders, and other health and social outcomes, than at any other time in the life course. There is now a growing body of evidence that indicates which interventions are ready for scale-up or show sufficient promise for further research and refinement. These are primarily delivered in community or school platforms through nonspecialist workers in partnership with parents and teachers. They include interventions to promote early child development, parenting interventions through childhood into adolescence, school interventions aimed at reengineering school environments and strengthening life skills, and interventions for the early detection and management of neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health problems through trans-diagnostic interventions based on impairments. Above all, what is needed is a population-based approach, which emphasizes the goal of coverage of evidence-based interventions for all children; with a particular focus on disadvantaged children; with seamless coordination of preventive and treatment interventions across platforms of care; and utilizing collaborative, stepped-care delivery paradigms.",eng,Child and adolescent mental health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

There is an urgent need for better tools for TB control, which include an effective vaccine. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the currently licensed vaccine, confers highly variable protection against pulmonary TB, the main source of TB transmission. Replacing BCG completely or boosting BCG with another vaccine are the two current strategies for TB vaccine development. Delivering a vaccine by aerosol represents a way to match the route of vaccination to the route of infection. This route of immunisation offers not only the scientific advantage of delivering the vaccine directly to the respiratory mucosa, but also practical and logistical advantages. This review summarises the state of current TB vaccine candidates in the pipeline, reviews current progress in aerosol administration of vaccines in general and evaluates the potential for TB vaccine candidates to be administered by the aerosol route.",eng,Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The application under evaluation, WellWave, promoted walking as a physical exercise, and offered a variety of supportive non-physical activities, including confidential text-messaging with peer staff, and a digital library of readings and videos on recovery from psychiatric illness. Study participants engaged strongly in the app throughout the 4-week study, showing a 94 % mean daily usage rate, and a 73 % mean response rate across all electronic messages and prompts, which approximates the gold standard of 75 % for momentary ecological assessment studies. Seven of the ten study participants averaged two or more walks per week, beginning with 5-min walks and ending with walks lasting 20 min or longer. This responsiveness to the walking prompts, and the overall high rate of engagement in other app features, suggest that adults with psychiatric conditions would welcome and benefit from similar smartphone interventions that promote healthy behaviours in life domains other than exercise. Pilot study results also suggest that smartphone applications can be useful as research tools in the development and testing of theories and practical strategies for encouraging healthy lifestyles. Participants were prompted periodically to rate their own health quality, perceived control over their health, and stage-of-change in adopting a walking routine, and these electronic self-ratings showed acceptable concurrent and discriminant validity, with all participants reporting moderate to high motivation to exercise by the end of the study.",eng,The Psychiatric quarterly,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25636146,10.1021/ci500672v,"A virtual screen discovers novel, fragment-sized inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis InhA.","Isoniazid (INH) is usually administered to treat latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections and is used in combination therapy to treat active tuberculosis (TB). Unfortunately, resistance to this drug is hampering its clinical effectiveness. INH is a prodrug that must be activated by Mtb catalase-peroxidase (KatG) before it can inhibit InhA (Mtb enoyl-acyl-carrier-protein reductase). Isoniazid-resistant cases of TB found in clinical settings usually involve mutations in or deletion of katG, which abrogate INH activation. Compounds that inhibit InhA without requiring prior activation by KatG would not be affected by this resistance mechanism and hence would display continued potency against these drug-resistant isolates of Mtb. Virtual screening experiments versus InhA in the GO Fight Against Malaria (GO FAM) project were designed to discover new scaffolds that display base-stacking interactions with the NAD cofactor. GO FAM experiments included targets from other pathogens, including Mtb, when they had structural similarity to a malaria target. Eight of the 16 soluble compounds identified by docking against InhA plus visual inspection were modest inhibitors and did not require prior activation by KatG. The best two inhibitors discovered are both fragment-sized compounds and displayed Ki values of 54 and 59 μM, respectively. Importantly, the novel inhibitors discovered have low structural similarity to known InhA inhibitors and thus help expand the number of chemotypes on which future medicinal chemistry efforts can be focused. These new fragment hits could eventually help advance the fight against INH-resistant Mtb strains, which pose a significant global health threat.",eng,Journal of chemical information and modeling,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are emerging as key effectors of tissue destruction in TB but have not been comprehensively studied in plasma, nor have gender differences been investigated. We measured the plasma concentrations of MMPs in a carefully characterised, prospectively recruited clinical cohort of 380 individuals. The collagenases, MMP-1 and MMP-8, were elevated in plasma of patients with pulmonary TB relative to healthy controls, and MMP-7 (matrilysin) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) were also increased. MMP-8 was TB-specific (p<0.001), not being elevated in symptomatic controls (symptoms suspicious of TB but active disease excluded). Plasma MMP-8 concentrations inversely correlated with body mass index. Plasma MMP-8 concentration was 1.51-fold higher in males than females with TB (p<0.05) and this difference was not due to greater disease severity in men. Gender-specific analysis of MMPs demonstrated consistent increase in MMP-1 and -8 in TB, but MMP-8 was a better discriminator for TB in men.

Although there are nutrition interventions in Hawaii and the Pacific, success is limited, in part, because of the lack of tailoring for the Pacific context. The Pacific context is inclusive of environment, political, and economic situation; historical (precontact, colonial, and post colonial) background; cultural practices; and spiritual orientation. This study used Grounded Theory and Community-Based Participatory Research processes to identify influences that hinder or facilitate adherence to nutrition recommendations. Data were gathered through key informant interviews (faith leaders and health care providers) and focus-group discussions (individual with diabetes and care takers). Results showed barriers to nutrition recommendations adherence that were similar to other minority populations in the United States, such as cost of healthy foods, taste preference, low availability of healthy food choices, lack of ideas for healthy meals/cooking, and lack of culturally appropriate options for dietary modification. It also elucidated behaviors that influence adherence to nutrition recommendations, such as preparing and consuming meals for and with extended family and church members; patient and group motivation; and access to healthy, affordable, and palatable foods. Participants expressed the need for interventions that are tailored to the local culture and context and a holistic view of health, with a focus on motivation (spiritual and emotional support). These findings could be used to develop culturally and contextually appropriate programs. For example, adapting motivational interviewing techniques and materials by adding family members to motivational interviewing sessions vs patients only, as Pacific Islanders have a collectivistic culture and family members play an important role in adherence; conducting motivational interviewing in the community in addition to the clinical setting; utilizing church leaders as motivational interviewing counselors in addition to health care providers; and changing motivational interviewing narratives and tools (eg, a confidence scale of 1 to 10 will be unfamiliar to many Pacific Islanders); therefore, counselors need to develop another method to indicate levels of confidence, such as the color of the lagoon/ocean that goes from turquoise (the color of shallow water) to navy blue (the color of deep water).",eng,Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This study examines these issues in Zambia, analysing data from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Zambia Survey.--NEW SECTION--Data from Wave 1 of the ITC Zambia Survey (2012) were analysed for current smokers of factory-made (FM) cigarettes compared with those who smoked both FM and roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes, using multivariate logistic regression models to identify the predictors of brand loyalty and reasons for brand choice.--NEW SECTION--75% of FM-only smokers and 64% of FM+RYO smokers reported having a regular brand. Compared with FM-only smokers, FM+RYO smokers were, on average, older (28% vs 20% ≥40 years), low income (64% vs 43%) and had lower education (76% vs 44% < secondary). Mean price across FM brands was ZMW0.50 (US$0.08) per stick. Smokers were significantly less likely to be brand loyal (>1 year) if they were aged 15-17 years (vs 40-54 years) and if they had moderate (vs low) income. Brand choice was predicted mostly by friends, taste and brand popularity. Price was more likely to be a reason for brand loyalty among FM+RYO smokers, among ≥55-year-old smokers and among those who reported being more addicted to cigarettes.--NEW SECTION--These results in Zambia document the high levels of brand loyalty in a market where price variation is fairly small across cigarette brands.

This is mainly due to the difficulty of bringing such knowledge to health workers and decision-makers so that it can inform practices and decisions on a timely basis. One strategy for transferring knowledge to potential users, that is, gaining increasing legitimacy, is knowledge brokering (KB), effectiveness of which in certain conditions has been demonstrated through empirical research. However, little is known about how to implement such a strategy, especially in the African context. The KB program presented here is aimed specifically at narrowing the gap by making scientific knowledge available to users with the potential to improve health-related practices and decision making in Burkina Faso. The program involves Canadian and African researchers, a knowledge broker, health practitioners, and policy-makers. This article presents the collaborative development of the KB strategy and the evaluation of its implementation at year 1. The KB strategy was developed in stages, beginning with a scoping study to ensure the most recent studies were considered. Two one-day workshops were then conducted to explore the problem of low research use and to adapt the strategy to the Burkinabè context. Based on these workshops, the KB program was developed and brokers were recruited and trained. Evaluation of the program's implementation after the first year showed that: 1) the preparatory activities were greatly appreciated by participants, and most considered the content useful for their work; 2) the broker had carried out his role in accordance with the logic model; and 3) this role was seen as important by the participants targeted by the activities and outputs.

Drawing on these guidelines, a formal survey was sent to prominent faculty at each of the 14 English-speaking Canadian medical schools. A thematic analysis of the results was then conducted.--NEW SECTION--Overall, the guidelines were strongly endorsed. A majority of Canadian medical schools have programs in place to offer global health course work, extracurricular learning opportunities, local community service-learning, low-resource-setting clinical electives, predeparture training, and postreturn debriefing. Although student evaluation, global health mentorship, and knowledge translation projects were endorsed as important components, few schools had been successful in implementing them. Language training for global health remains contested. Other common critiques included a lack of time and resources, and difficulties in setting standards for student evaluation.--NEW SECTION--The results suggest that these guidelines are appropriate and, at least for the major criteria, achievable. Although many Canadian schools offer individual components, the majority of schools have yet to develop formally structured concentration programs. By better articulating guidelines, a standardized framework can aid in the establishment and refinement of future programs.",eng,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25628310,10.1136/thoraxjnl-2014-206605,Translating the transcriptome into tools for the early detection and prevention of lung cancer.,"Despite advances in the management of lung cancer, this disease remains a significant global health burden with survival rates that have not significantly improved in decades. The mortality reduction achieved by low-dose helical CT (LDCT) screening of select high-risk patients is challenged by the high false positive rate of this screening modality and the potential for morbidity associated with follow-up diagnostic evaluation in patients with high risk for iatrogenic complications. The diagnostic dilemma of the indeterminate nodule incidentally identified on diagnostic or screening CT has created a need for reliable biomarkers capable of distinguishing benign from malignant disease. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to develop molecular biomarkers to supplement clinical risk models in order to identify patients at highest risk for having an early stage lung cancer that may derive the greatest benefit from LDCT screening, as well as identifying patients at high-risk for developing lung cancer that may be candidates for emerging chemopreventive strategies. Evolving bioinformatic techniques and the application of these algorithms to analyse the transcriptomic changes associated with lung cancer promise translational discoveries that can bridge these large clinical gaps. The identification of lung cancer associated transcriptomic alterations in readily accessible tissue sampling sites offers the potential to develop early diagnostic and risk stratification strategies applicable to large populations. This review summarises the challenges associated with the early detection, screening and chemoprevention of lung cancer with an emphasis on how genomic information encapsulated by the transcriptome can facilitate future innovations in these clinical settings.",eng,Thorax,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, only a few studies have described suicide attempts in patients with SLE in detail.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this study is to describe the suicide attempts in patients with SLE in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan.--NEW SECTION--A total of 8 patients with SLE, 7 women and 1 man, with 12 suicide attempts among them were identified among 2469 patients visiting a tertiary medical center in Taiwan, from March 1, 2003 to November 30, 2013. Their demographic data, lupus manifestations throughout their disease course, laboratory data, and details of their suicide attempts were retrospectively documented. We also searched the MEDLINE database and found 4 articles in English describing suicide attempts in 14 patients with SLE.--NEW SECTION--The median age of the 8 patients with SLE in our hospital who attempted suicide was 33 years (range: 19-77 years). Neuropsychiatric SLE developed in 5 (63%) of these patients before the attempts, and psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 5 (63%) of them. We also observed a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric SLE (71%) and psychiatric disorders (86%) in patients with SLE in the literature who had attempted suicide.--NEW SECTION--We demonstrated that previous neuropsychiatric SLE and comorbid psychiatric disorders are prevalent in patients with SLE who attempt suicide.

In this work, we describe the design of a simple Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) platform for mHealth medical diagnostics. The LOC utilizes a passive capillary valve with no moving parts for fluid control using channels with very low aspect ratios cross sections (i.e., channel width ≫ height) achieved through transitions in the channel geometry via that arrest capillary flow. Using a CO2 laser in raster engraving mode, we have designed and fabricated an eight-channel LOC for fluorescence signal detection fabricated by engraving and combining just two polymer layers. Each of the LOC channels is capable of mixing two reagents (e.g., enzyme and substrate) for various assays. For mHealth detection, we used a mobile CCD detector equipped with LED multispectral illumination in the red, green, blue, and white range. This technology enables the development of low-cost LOC platforms for mHealth whose fabrication is compatible with standard industrial plastic fabrication processes to enable mass production of mHealth diagnostic devices, which may broaden the use of LOCs in PoC applications, especially in global health settings.",eng,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

A key element to achieving high sensitivity using low sensitivity phone cameras is a capillary array, which increases sensitivity by 100×. The capillary array was combined with a white LED illumination system to enable wide spectra fluorescent excitation in the range of 450-740 nm. The detector utilizes an orthographic projection system to form parallel light projection images from the capillaries at a close distance via an object-space telecentric lens configuration that reduces the total lens-to-object distance while maintaining uniformity in measurement between capillaries. To further increase the limit of detection (LOD), a computational image processing approach was employed to decrease the level of noise. This enables an additional 5-10× decrease in LOD. This smartphone-based detector was used to measure serial dilutions of fluorescein with a LOD of 1 nM with image stacking and 10 nM without image stacking, similar to the LOD obtained with a commercial plate reader. Moreover, the capillary array required a sample volume of less than 10 μl, which is an order of magnitude less than the 100 μl required for the plate reader.As fluorescence detection is widely used in sensitive biomedical assays, the approach described here has the potential to increase mHealth clinical utility, especially for telemedicine and for resource-poor settings in global health applications.",eng,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Flow cytometry and optical microscopy are widely used techniques to perform blood analysis and therefore cost-effective translation of these technologies to resource limited settings is critical for various global health as well as telemedicine applications. In this chapter, we review our recent progress on the integration of imaging flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy on a cell phone using compact, light-weight and cost-effective opto-fluidic attachments integrated onto the camera module of a smartphone. In our cell-phone based opto-fluidic imaging cytometry design, fluorescently labeled cells are delivered into the imaging area using a disposable micro-fluidic chip that is positioned above the existing camera unit of the cell phone. Battery powered light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are butt-coupled to the sides of this micro-fluidic chip without any lenses, which effectively acts as a multimode slab waveguide, where the excitation light is guided to excite the fluorescent targets within the micro-fluidic chip. Since the excitation light propagates perpendicular to the detection path, an inexpensive plastic absorption filter is able to reject most of the scattered light and create a decent dark-field background for fluorescent imaging. With this excitation geometry, the cell-phone camera can record fluorescent movies of the particles/cells as they are flowing through the microchannel. The digital frames of these fluorescent movies are then rapidly processed to quantify the count and the density of the labeled particles/cells within the solution under test. With a similar opto-fluidic design, we have recently demonstrated imaging and automated counting of stationary blood cells (e.g., labeled white blood cells or unlabeled red blood cells) loaded within a disposable cell counting chamber. We tested the performance of this cell-phone based imaging cytometry and blood analysis platform by measuring the density of red and white blood cells as well as hemoglobin concentration in human blood samples, which showed a good match to our measurement results obtained using a commercially available hematology analyzer. Such a cell-phone enabled opto-fluidics microscopy, flow cytometry, and blood analysis platform could be especially useful for various telemedicine applications in remote and resource-limited settings.",eng,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The high death rate in developing countries is largely due to the fact that these countries do not have the appropriate medical infrastructure and resources to support the organized screening and diagnostic programs that are available in the developed world. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) with a fiber-optic probe can noninvasively quantify the optical properties of epithelial tissues and has shown the potential as a cost-effective, easy-to-use, and sensitive tool for diagnosis of early precancerous changes in the cervix and oral cavity. However, current fiber-optic DRS systems have not been designed to be robust and reliable for use in developing countries. They are subject to various sources of systematic or random errors, arising from the uncontrolled probe-tissue interface and lack of real-time calibration, use bulky and expensive optical components, and require extensive training. This chapter describes a portable DRS device that is specifically designed for detection of oral and cervical cancers in resource-poor settings. The device uses an innovative smart fiber-optic probe to eliminate operator bias, state-of-the-art photonics components to reduce size and power consumption, and automated software to reduce the need of operator training. The size and cost of the smart fiber-optic DRS system may be further reduced by incorporating a smartphone based spectrometer.",eng,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25626537,10.1007/978-1-4939-2172-0_10,Mobile flow cytometer for mHealth.,"Flow cytometry is used for cell counting and analysis in numerous clinical and environmental applications. However flow cytometry is not used in mHealth mainly because current flow cytometers are large, expensive, power-intensive devices designed to operate in a laboratory. Their design results in a lack of portability and makes them unsuitable for mHealth applications. Another limitation of current technology is the low volumetric throughput rates that are not suitable for rapid detection of rare cells.To address these limitations, we describe here a novel, low-cost, mobile flow cytometer based on wide-field imaging with a webcam for large volume and high throughput fluorescence detection of rare cells as a simulation for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection. The mobile flow cytometer uses a commercially available webcam capable of 187 frames per second video capture at a resolution of 320 × 240 pixels. For fluorescence detection, a 1 W 450 nm blue laser is used for excitation of Syto-9 fluorescently stained cells detected at 535 nm. A wide-field flow cell was developed for large volume analysis that allows for the linear velocity of target cells to be lower than in conventional hydrodynamic focusing flow cells typically used in cytometry. The mobile flow cytometer was found to be capable of detecting low concentrations at flow rates of 500 μL/min, suitable for rare cell detection in large volumes. The simplicity and low cost of this device suggests that it may have a potential clinical use for mHealth flow cytometry for resource-poor settings associated with global health.",eng,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Traditionally, epidemiologists have identified such risk factors using medical databases and lengthy clinical studies but these are often limited in size and cost and can fail to take full account of diseases where there are social stigmas or to identify transient acute risk factors.--NEW SECTION--Here we report that Web search engine queries coupled with information on Wikipedia access patterns can be used to infer health events associated with an individual user and automatically generate Web-based risk markers for some of the common medical conditions worldwide, from cardiovascular disease to sexually transmitted infections and mental health conditions, as well as pregnancy.--NEW SECTION--Using anonymized datasets, we present methods to first distinguish individuals likely to have experienced specific health events, and classify them into distinct categories. We then use the self-controlled case series method to find the incidence of health events in risk periods directly following a user's search for a query category, and compare to the incidence during other periods for the same individuals.--NEW SECTION--Searches for pet stores were risk markers for allergy. We also identified some possible new risk markers; for example: searching for fast food and theme restaurants was associated with a transient increase in risk of myocardial infarction, suggesting this exposure goes beyond a long-term risk factor but may also act as an acute trigger of myocardial infarction. Dating and adult content websites were risk markers for sexually transmitted infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).--NEW SECTION--Web-based methods provide a powerful, low-cost approach to automatically identify risk factors, and support more timely and personalized public health efforts to bring human and economic benefits.",eng,Journal of medical Internet research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Studies satisfying our a priori eligibility criteria were evaluated independently by two authors.--NEW SECTION--Our systematic search yielded 888 articles; of these, 23 were included in the systematic review. Sixteen provided sufficient data for our quantitative analysis. Arsenic in groundwater (≥ 50 μg/L) was associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion (6 studies: OR = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.27, 3.10), stillbirth (9 studies: OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.32, 2.36), moderate risk of neonatal mortality (5 studies: OR = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.78), and infant mortality (7 studies: OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.62). Exposure to environmental arsenic was associated with a significant reduction in birth weight (4 studies: β = -53.2 g; 95% CI: -94.9, -11.4). There was paucity of evidence for low-to-moderate arsenic dose.--NEW SECTION--Arsenic is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant mortality. The interpretation of the causal association is hampered by methodological challenges and limited number of studies on dose response. Exposure to arsenic continues to be a major global health issue, and we therefore advocate for high-quality prospective studies that include individual-level data to quantify the impact of arsenic on adverse pregnancy outcomes/infant mortality.",eng,Environmental health perspectives,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

A major problem faced by the hospital system was the lack of an available and sustainable supply of medications. Long-term viability of the hospital system depended largely on developing an uninterrupted medication supply chain.--NEW SECTION--We hypothesized that the implementation of a new Pharmacy Computerized Inventory Program (PCIP) would optimize medication availability and decrease medication shortages.--NEW SECTION--We conducted the research by examining how medications were being utilized and distributed before and after the implementation of PCIP. We measured the number of documented medication transactions in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 as well as user logins to determine if a computerized inventory system would be beneficial in providing a sustainable, long-term solution to their medication management needs.--NEW SECTION--The PCIP incorporated drug ordering, filling the drug requests, distribution, and dispensing of the medications in multiple settings; inventory of currently shelved medications; and graphic reporting of 'real-time' medication usage. During the PCIP initiation and establishment periods, the number of medication transactions increased from 219.6 to 359.5 (p=0.055), respectively, and the mean logins per day increased from 24.3 to 31.5, p<0.0001, respectively. The PCIP allows the hospital staff to identify and order medications with a critically low supply as well as track usage for future medication needs.

Meanwhile, poverty-related diseases are considered to be neglected in terms of research and development (R&D).--NEW SECTION--Developing intuitive and meaningful metrics to measure how different diseases are related to poverty and neglected in the current R&D system.--NEW SECTION--We measured how diseases are related to economic development with the income relation factor (IRF), defined by the ratio of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100,000 inhabitants in LMIC versus that in high-income countries. We calculated the IRF for 291 diseases and injuries and 67 risk factors included in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. We measured neglect in R&D with the neglect factor (NF), defined by the ratio of disease burden in DALYs (as percentage of the total global disease burden) and R&D expenditure (as percentage of total global health-related R&D expenditure) for 26 diseases.--NEW SECTION--The disease burden varies considerably with the level of economic development, shown by the IRF (median: 1.38; interquartile range (IQR): 0.79-6.3). Comparison of IRFs from 1990 to 2010 highlights general patterns of the global epidemiological transition. The 26 poverty-related diseases included in our analysis of neglect in R&D are responsible for 13.8% of the global disease burden, but receive only 1.34% of global health-related R&D expenditure. Within this group, the NF varies considerably (median: 19; IQR: 6-52).--NEW SECTION--The IRF is an intuitive and meaningful metric to highlight shifts in global disease burden patterns.

New drugs in the 1940s made it possible to beat the disease, and consequently, the number of cases reduced drastically. Fast-forward a few decades, drugresistant strains of varied virulence are reported consistently, disease is again on the rise and the treatment has not kept pace. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death among HIV-infected persons in many resource-constrained settings however, it is curable and preventable. The unprecedented growth of the tuberculosis epidemic in Africa is attributable to several factors, the most important being the HIV epidemic. Analysis of molecular-based data have shown diverse genetic backgrounds among both drug-sensitive and MDR TB isolates in Africa presumably due to underlying genetic and environmental differences. The good news is that there have been important advances recently in TB drugs and diagnostics. Despite the availability of revolutionary tests that allow for faster diagnosis and of new drugs and regimens that offer better and safer treatment it is now becoming clearer that national efforts on TB control should be enhanced and focus on improving the quality of prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care services; strengthening program management, implementation and supervision.

By age, nation, and region, we contrast key GBV indicators, specifically intimate partner violence (IPV) and forced sexual debut among adolescent and young adult women using Demographic and Health Surveys across low- and middle-income countries.--NEW SECTION--National prevalence estimates were generated among adolescents (15-19 years) and young adults (20-24 years) for lifetime and the past-year physical and sexual IPV among ever-married/cohabitating women (30 nations) and forced sexual debut among sexually experienced women (17 nations). Meta-analyses provided regional estimates and cross-national comparisons, and compared the past-year IPV prevalence among adolescent and young adult women to adult women.--NEW SECTION--An estimated 28% of adolescent and 29% of young adult women reported lifetime physical or sexual IPV, most prevalent in the East and Southern Africa region. Regional and cross-national variation emerged in patterns of violence by age; overall, young adult women demonstrated higher risk for the past-year IPV relative to adult women (meta-analysis odds ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.37) and adolescents had a comparable risk (meta-analysis odds ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, .91-1.23). Forced sexual debut was estimated at 12% overall, highest in the East and Southern Africa region.--NEW SECTION--GBV is pervasive among adolescent and young adult women in low- and middle-income countries.

Patient responses to the AntiA were analyzed for internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, and responsiveness to change in clinical status. All tested scales were found to have good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.70-0.92). Test-retest reliability was also good (0.72-0.88) for total and subscale scores and lower for individual items. The total score, subscale scores, and all single items (except nosebleeds) significantly differentiated between groups defined by level of side effect bother.

Search terms included waterpipe and its many variant terms.--NEW SECTION--Articles were included if they were published between 1990 and 2014, were in English, were available in full text and included the age group 10-29 years.--NEW SECTION--Articles which analysed determinants of WTS at any of the levels of the EMHP were retained regardless of methodological rigour: 131 articles are included. Articles were coded in a standard template that abstracted methods as well as results.--NEW SECTION--The review found that methodologies used to assess determinants of WTS among youth were often conventional and lacked rigor: 3/4 of the studies were cross-sectional surveys and most enrolled non-representative samples. Within the framework, the review identified determinants of WTS at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, organisational, community and policy levels.--NEW SECTION--The review suggests potential interventions to control WTS among youth, with emphasis on creative utilisation of social media, and tobacco control policies that include the specificities of WTS.

We developed a rapid Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) amplification/detection method, called MTB isothermal solid-phase amplification/detection (MTB-ISAD), that couples isothermal solid-phase amplification and a silicon biophotonics-based detection sensor to allow the simultaneous amplification and detection of MTB in a label-free and real-time manner. We validated the clinical utility of the MTB-ISAD assay by detecting MTB nucleic acid in sputum samples from 42 patients. We showed the ability of the MTB-ISAD assay to detect MTB in 42 clinical specimens, confirming that the MTB-ISAD assay is fast (<20 min), highly sensitive, accurate (>90%, 38/42), and cost-effective because it is a label-free method and does not involve thermal cycling. The MTB-ISAD assay has improved time-efficiency, affordability, and sensitivity compared with many existing methods. Therefore, it is potentially adaptable for better diagnosis across various clinical applications.",eng,Biosensors & bioelectronics,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2015

25612195,10.1111/adb.12225,Adenosine 2A receptors modulate reward behaviours for methamphetamine.,"Addiction to methamphetamine (METH) is a global health problem for which there are no approved pharmacotherapies. The adenosine 2A (A2 A ) receptor presents a potential therapeutic target for METH abuse due to its modulatory effects on striatal dopamine and glutamate transmission. Notably, A2 A receptor signalling has been implicated in the rewarding effects of alcohol, cocaine and opiates; yet, the role of this receptor in METH consumption and seeking is essentially unknown. Therefore, the current study used A2 A knockout (KO) mice to assess the role of A2 A in behaviours relevant to METH addiction. METH conditioned place preference was absent in A2 A KO mice compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. Repeated METH treatment produced locomotor sensitization in both genotypes; however, sensitization was attenuated in A2 A KO mice in a dose-related manner. METH intravenous self-administration was intact in A2 A KO mice over a range of doses and schedules of reinforcement. However, the motivation to self-administer was reduced in A2 A KO mice. Regression analysis further supported the observation that the motivation to self-administer METH was reduced in A2 A KO mice even when self-administration was similar to WT mice. Sucrose self-administration was also reduced in A2 A KO mice but only at higher schedules of reinforcement. Collectively, these data suggest that A2 A signalling is critically required to integrate rewarding and motivational properties of both METH and natural rewards.",eng,Addiction biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
25609801,10.1128/JVI.03647-14,Characterization of hepatitis C virus interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry involves binding to cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) structures. However, due to the lipoprotein-like structure of HCV, the exact contribution of virion components to this interaction remains controversial. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of HCV envelope proteins and apolipoprotein E in the HS-binding step. Deletion of hypervariable region 1, a region previously proposed to be involved in HS binding, did not alter HCV virion binding to HS, indicating that this region is not involved in this interaction in the context of a viral infection. Patient sera and monoclonal antibodies recognizing different regions of HCV envelope glycoproteins were also used in a pulldown assay with beads coated with heparin, a close HS structural homologue. Although isolated HCV envelope glycoproteins could interact with heparin, none of these antibodies was able to interfere with the virion-heparin interaction, strongly suggesting that at the virion surface, HCV envelope glycoproteins are not accessible for HS binding. In contrast, results from kinetic studies, heparin pulldown experiments, and inhibition experiments with anti-apolipoprotein E antibodies indicated that this apolipoprotein plays a major role in HCV-HS interaction. Finally, characterization of the HS structural determinants required for HCV infection by silencing of the enzymes involved in the HS biosynthesis pathway and by competition with modified heparin indicated that N- and 6-O-sulfation but not 2-O-sulfation is required for HCV infection and that the minimum HS oligosaccharide length required for HCV infection is a decasaccharide. Together, these data indicate that HCV hijacks apolipoprotein E to initiate its interaction with specific HS structures.--NEW SECTION--Hepatitis C is a global health problem. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects approximately 130 million individuals worldwide, with the majority of cases remaining undiagnosed and untreated. In most infected individuals, the virus evades the immune system and establishes a chronic infection. As a consequence, hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation. Virus infection is initiated by entry of the virus into the host cell. In this study, we provide new insights into the viral and cellular determinants involved in the first step of HCV entry, the binding of the virus to host cells. We show that apolipoprotein E is likely responsible for virus binding to heparan sulfate and that N- and 6-O-sulfation of the heparan sulfate proteoglycans is required for HCV infection. In addition, the minimal HS length unit required for HCV infection is a decasaccharide.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We aimed to summarize the association between ATS use and HIV infection among MSM.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, GLOBAL HEALTH and PsycINFO for relevant English, peer-reviewed articles of quantitative studies published between 1980 and 25 April 2013. Pooled estimates of the association--prevalence rate ratios (PRR, cross-sectional studies), odds ratio (OR, case-control studies) and hazard ratio (HR, longitudinal studies), with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI)--were calculated using random-effects models stratified by study design and ATS group (meth/amphetamines vs. ecstasy). We assessed the existence of publication bias in funnel plots and checked for sources of heterogeneity using meta-regression and subgroup analysis.--NEW SECTION--We identified 6710 article titles, screened 1716 abstracts and reviewed 267 full text articles. A total of 35 publications were eligible for data abstraction and meta-analysis, resulting in 56 records of ATS use. Most studies (31/35) were conducted in high-income countries. Published studies used different research designs, samples and measures of ATS use. The pooled association between meth/amphetamine use and HIV infection was statistically significant in all three designs (PRR = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.57-2.17; OR = 2.73; 95% CI: 2.16-3.46 and HR = 3.43; 95% CI: 2.98-3.95, respectively, for cross-sectional, case-control and longitudinal studies). Ecstasy use was not associated with HIV infection in cross-sectional studies (PRR = 1.15; 95% CI: 0.88-1.49; OR = 3.04; 95% CI: 1.29-7.18 and HR = 2.48; 95% CI: 1.42-4.35, respectively, for cross-sectional, case-control and longitudinal studies). RESULTS in cross-sectional studies were highly heterogeneous due to issues with ATS measurement and different sampling frames.--NEW SECTION--While meth/amphetamine use was significantly associated with HIV infection among MSM in high-income countries in all study designs, evidence of the role of ecstasy in HIV infection was lacking in cross-sectional studies. Cross-sectional study design, measurement approaches and source populations may also be important modifiers of the strength and the direction of associations. Event-specific measure of individual drug is required to establish temporal relationship between ATS use and HIV infection. HIV prevention programmes targeting MSM should consider including interventions designed to address meth/amphetamine use.",eng,Journal of the International AIDS Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, the routine and comprehensive assessment of health impacts within EIAs remains underdeveloped. Focusing, as an example, on the risks to global health from the global shift in the mining industry towards Low and Middle Income Countries LMIC), this viewpoint details why connecting with EIA is an essential task for the health system. Although existing knowledge is out of date in relation to global practice we identify how health has been included, to some extent, in High Income Country EIAs and the institutional requirements for doing so. Using arguments identified by industry themselves about requiring a 'social license to operate', we conclude that EIA regulations provide the best current mechanism to ensure health protection is a core aspect in the decision making process  to approve projects.",eng,International journal of environmental research and public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Our aim was to evaluate the clinical features, psychological factors, and health-related quality of life (QoL), before and after diagnosis, in a representative sample of adult Mexican Mestizo patients presenting with CD.--NEW SECTION--A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on patients seen at two tertiary referral centers in Mexico. QoL before and after CD diagnosis was evaluated using the EuroQoL 5D, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the disease-specific Celiac Symptom Index (CSI) questionnaires.--NEW SECTION--We included 80 patients (80% were women, with a mean age of 48.6 ± 14.1 years). The most common symptoms were diarrhea (86%), bloating (77.5%), and abdominal pain (71.3%). Mean symptom duration was 10.33 ± 6.3 years. Fifty-one patients (63.8%) had a previous diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 23 (28.8%) had one of functional dyspepsia. Questionnaire respondents rated their health status at 50% before diagnosis (0 = worst imaginable state, 100 = best imaginable state) and there was a significant improvement of 26% after diagnosis. Thirty-nine percent of the patients had a CSI score > 45 and they were the ones that had been previously diagnosed most often with IBS (p = 0.13) or dyspepsia (p = .036).--NEW SECTION--At the time of diagnosis, Mexican Mestizo patients with CD had poor QoL. Long-standing symptoms and a previous diagnosis of functional disorders were associated with worse QoL. As in other populations, our results support the need for a detailed examination of cost-effective strategies for increasing CD awareness in clinical practice.",eng,BMC gastroenterology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Stratification factors were human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status and geographic region. Coprimary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).--NEW SECTION--Median OS times for eribulin (n = 554) and capecitabine (n = 548) were 15.9 and 14.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.00; P = .056). Median PFS times for eribulin and capecitabine were 4.1 and 4.2 months, respectively (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.25; P = .30). Objective response rates were 11.0% for eribulin and 11.5% for capecitabine. Global health status and overall quality-of-life scores over time were similar in the treatment arms.

25605771,10.1128/IAI.03123-14,Selection for a CEACAM receptor-specific binding phenotype during Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection of the human genital tract.,"Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae are increasingly common, are often caused by antibiotic-resistant strains, and can result in serious and lasting sequelae, prompting the reemergence of gonococcal disease as a leading global health concern. N. gonorrhoeae is a human-restricted pathogen that primarily colonizes urogenital mucosal surfaces. Disease progression varies greatly between the sexes: men usually present with symptomatic infection characterized by a painful purulent urethral discharge, while in women, the infection is often asymptomatic, with the most severe pathology occurring when the bacteria ascend from the lower genital tract into the uterus and fallopian tubes. Classical clinical studies demonstrated that clinically infectious strains uniformly express Opa adhesins; however, their specificities were unknown at the time. While in vitro studies have since identified CEACAM proteins as the primary target of Opa proteins, the gonococcal specificity for this human family of receptors has not been addressed in the context of natural infection. In this study, we characterize a collection of low-passage-number clinical-specimen-derived N. gonorrhoeae isolates for Opa expression and assess their CEACAM-binding profiles. We report marked in vivo selection for expression of phase-variable Opa proteins that bind CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 but selection against expression of Opa variants that bind to the neutrophil-restricted decoy receptor CEACAM3. This is the first study showing phenotypic selection for distinct CEACAM-binding phenotypes in vivo, and it supports the opposing functions of CEACAMs that facilitate infection versus driving inflammation within the genital tract.",eng,Infection and immunity,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25604792,10.1128/mBio.02493-14,Malaria induces anemia through CD8+ T cell-dependent parasite clearance and erythrocyte removal in the spleen.,"Severe malarial anemia (SMA) in semi-immune individuals eliminates both infected and uninfected erythrocytes and is a frequent fatal complication. It is proportional not to circulating parasitemia but total parasite mass (sequestered) in the organs. Thus, immune responses that clear parasites in organs may trigger changes leading to anemia. Here, we use an outbred-rat model where increasing parasite removal in the spleen escalated uninfected-erythrocyte removal. Splenic parasite clearance was associated with activated CD8(+) T cells, immunodepletion of which prevented parasite clearance. CD8(+) T cell repletion and concomitant reduction of the parasite load was associated with exacerbated (40 to 60%) hemoglobin loss and changes in properties of uninfected erythrocytes. Together, these data suggest that CD8(+) T cell-dependent parasite clearance causes erythrocyte removal in the spleen and thus anemia. In children infected with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, elevation of parasite biomass (not the number of circulating parasites) increased the odds ratio for SMA by 3.5-fold (95% confidence intervals [CI95%], 1.8- to 7.5-fold). CD8(+) T cell expansion/activation independently increased the odds ratio by 2.4-fold (CI95%, 1.0- to 5.7-fold). Concomitant increases in both conferred a 7-fold (CI95%, 1.9- to 27.4-fold)-greater risk for SMA. Together, these data suggest that CD8(+)-dependent parasite clearance may predispose individuals to uninfected-erythrocyte loss and SMA, thus informing severe disease diagnosis and strategies for vaccine development.--NEW SECTION--Malaria is a major global health problem. Severe malaria anemia (SMA) is a complex disease associated with partial immunity. Rapid hemoglobin reductions of 20 to 50% are commonly observed and must be rescued by transfusion (which can carry a risk of HIV acquisition). The causes and risk factors of SMA remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that SMA is linked to parasite biomass sequestered in organs. This led us to investigate whether immune mechanisms that clear parasites in organs trigger anemia. In rats, erythropoiesis is largely restricted to the bone marrow, and critical aspects of the spleen expected to be important in anemia are similar to those in humans. Therefore, using a rat model, we show that severe anemia is caused through CD8(+) T cell-dependent parasite clearance and erythrocyte removal in the spleen. CD8 activation may also be a new risk factor for SMA in African children.",eng,mBio,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This review focuses on the recent advances in the field of our understanding of selected intestinal infections.--NEW SECTION--Primary and secondary immunodeficiency increase the susceptibility to many chronic intestinal infections. Endoscopy and intestinal biopsies are central to establishing a diagnosis of these conditions. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge. Emerging therapeutic agents to counteract multidrug-resistant strains have shown clinical efficacy, but concerns regarding mortality remain. PCR-based diagnostic TB tests have the potential to reduce diagnostic delays, but remain to be validated for intestinal infections. Adjunctive diagnostic imaging modalities can differentiate infections from Crohn's disease with increasing accuracy. Whipple's disease remains rare, but there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the causative organism Tropheryma whipplei. Extended treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is effective in most cases. The narrow therapeutic window and limited armamentarium for treating invasive filamentous fungal infections contribute to their significant morbidity and high rates of mortality.--NEW SECTION--The speed and accuracy of diagnosing chronic intestinal infections have improved with recent imaging and laboratory methodologies.

Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) which are broad-spectrum β-lactamases that inactivate virtually all β-lactams including carbapenems, are contributing to this health problem. In this study a novel MBL variant, termed VIM-26, identified in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate was studied. VIM-26 belongs to the Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) family of MBLs and is a His224Leu variant of the well-characterized VIM-1 variant. In this study, we report the kinetic parameters, minimum inhibitory concentrations and crystal structures of a recombinant VIM-26 protein, and compare them to previously published data on VIM-1, VIM-2 and VIM-7. The kinetic parameters and minimum inhibitory concentration determinations show that VIM-26, like VIM-7, has higher penicillinase activity but lower cephalosporinase activity than VIM-1 and VIM-2. The four determined VIM-26 crystal structures revealed mono- and di-zinc forms, where the Zn1 ion has distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry with an additional water molecule (W2) at a distance of 2.6-3.7 Å, which could be important during catalysis. The R2 drug binding site in VIM-26 is more open compared to VIM-2 and VIM-7 and neutrally charged due to Leu224 and Ser228. Thus, the VIM-26 drug binding properties are different from the VIM-2 (Tyr224/Arg228) and VIM-7 (His224/Arg228) structures, indicating a role of these residues in the substrate specificity.",eng,The FEBS journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed and assessed for bias and confounding.--NEW SECTION--Six studies (in Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe) had relevant data on the effect of CTX on malaria in patients on ART: four were observational cohort studies (OCS) and two were randomised controlled trials (RCTs); two were in children and one in women only. Samples sizes ranged from 265 to 2200 patients. Four studies compared patients on ART and CTX with patients on ART alone; 2 (RCTs) found a significant increase in smear-positive malaria on ART alone: (IRR 32.5 CI = 8.6-275.0 and HR 2.2 CI = 1.5-3.3) and 2 (OCS) reported fewer parasitaemia episodes on CTX and ART (OR 0.85 CI = 0.65-1.11 and 3.6% vs. 2.4% of samples P = 0.14). One OCS found a 76% (95% CI = 63-84%) vs. 83% (95% CI = 74-89%) reduction in malaria incidence in children on CTX and ART vs. on CTX only, when both were compared with HIV-negative children. The other reported a 64% reduction in malaria incidence after adding ART to CTX (RR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.18-0.74). The 2 RCTs were unblinded.

Maintenance dialysis treatment programs developed in 29 countries over the past 50 years, usually many years after their independence and the end of subsequent territorial and civil wars. Eight countries had the resources to launch national dialysis programs, conventionally defined as those accommodating at least 100 patients per million population. Additionally, based on information obtained from international and local publications, conference proceedings, and personal communications, it appears that limited short-term dialysis therapy currently is available in most African countries. Currently, the prevalence of and outcomes associated with dialysis in Africa are influenced significantly by the following: (1) local health indexes, including the prevalence of undernutrition and chronic infections; (2) per capita gross domestic product; (3) national expenditures on health and growth of these expenditures with incremental demand; (4) availability and adequate training of health care providers; and (5) literacy. In an attempt to reduce the socioeconomic burden of maintenance dialysis treatment, 12 countries have adopted active transplantation programs and 5 are striving to develop screening and prevention programs. Our recommendations based on these observations include optimizing dialysis treatment initiatives and integrating them with other health strategies, as well as training and motivating local health care providers.

Yet, they bear risks to information security and privacy because users need to reveal private, sensitive medical information to redeem certain benefits. Due to the plethora and diversity of available mHealth apps, implications for information security and privacy are unclear and complex.--NEW SECTION--The objective of this study was to establish an overview of mHealth apps offered on iOS and Android with a special focus on potential damage to users through information security and privacy infringements.--NEW SECTION--We assessed apps available in English and offered in the categories ""Medical"" and ""Health & Fitness"" in the iOS and Android App Stores. Based on the information retrievable from the app stores, we established an overview of available mHealth apps, tagged apps to make offered information machine-readable, and clustered the discovered apps to identify and group similar apps. Subsequently, information security and privacy implications were assessed based on health specificity of information available to apps, potential damage through information leaks, potential damage through information manipulation, potential damage through information loss, and potential value of information to third parties.--NEW SECTION--We discovered 24,405 health-related apps (iOS; 21,953; Android; 2452). Absence or scarceness of ratings for 81.36% (17,860/21,953) of iOS and 76.14% (1867/2452) of Android apps indicates that less than a quarter of mHealth apps are in more or less widespread use. Clustering resulted in 245 distinct clusters, which were consolidated into 12 app archetypes grouping clusters with similar assessments of potential damage through information security and privacy infringements. There were 6426 apps that were excluded during clustering. The majority of apps (95.63%, 17,193/17,979; of apps) pose at least some potential damage through information security and privacy infringements. There were 11.67% (2098/17,979) of apps that scored the highest assessments of potential damages.--NEW SECTION--Various kinds of mHealth apps collect and offer critical, sensitive, private medical information, calling for a special focus on information security and privacy of mHealth apps.

While there are many bodies that engage in global health governance, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is the only entity whereby 194 countries are invited to congregate together and engage in global health governance on an equal playing field. This paper examines the diversity of governance within the World Health Assembly (WHA), the supreme decision-making body of the WHO. It explores the degree and balance of policy influence between high, middle and low-income countries and the relevance of the WHO as a platform to exercise global governance. It finds that governance within the WHA is indeed diverse: relative to the number of Member States within the regions, all regions are well represented. While developed countries still dominate WHA governance, Western world countries do not overshadow decision-making, but rather there is evidence of strong engagement from the emerging economies. It is apparent that the WHO is still a relevant platform whereby all Member States can and do participate in the shaping of global health governance.",eng,"Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Analysis was structured with respect to common challenges in such work, identified through a multi-dimensional scaling analysis of responses from 37 participants at the concluding symposium of the program of work.--NEW SECTION--Symposium participants identified 10 distinct clusters of challenges: engaging researchers, policymakers, and donors; securing trust and cooperation; finding common interest; securing long-term funding; establishing sustainable models of capacity strengthening; ensuring Southern ownership; accommodating local health system priorities and constraints; addressing disincentives for academic engagement; establishing and retaining research teams; and sustaining mentorship and institutional support. Analysis links these challenges to three key and potentially competing drivers of the political economy of health research: an enduring model of independent researchers and research leaders, the globalization of knowledge and the linked mobility of (elite) individuals, and institutionalization of research within universities and research centres and, increasingly, national research and development agendas.--NEW SECTION--We identify tensions between efforts to embrace the global 'Community of Science' and the promotion and protection of national and institutional agendas in an unequal global health research environment. A nuanced understanding of the dynamics and implications of the uneven global health research landscape is required, along with a willingness to explore pragmatic models that seek to balance these competing drivers.",eng,Health research policy and systems,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25595305,10.1016/j.toxlet.2015.01.007,Developments in alternative treatments for organophosphate poisoning.,"Organophosphosphates (OPs) are highly effective acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors that are used worldwide as cheap, multi-purpose insecticides. OPs are also used as chemical weapons forming the active core of G-series and V-series chemical agents including tabun, sarin, soman, cyclosarin, VX, and their chemical analogs. Human exposure to any of these compounds leads to neurotoxic accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, resulting in abnormal nerve function and multiple secondary health complications. Suicide from deliberate exposure to OPs is particularly prevalent in developing countries across the world and constitutes a major global health crisis. The prevalence and accessible nature of OP compounds within modern agricultural spheres and concern over their potential use in biochemical weapon attacks have incentivized both government agencies and medical researchers to enact stricter regulatory policies over their usage and to begin developing more proactive medical treatments in cases of OP poisoning. This review will discuss the research undertaken in recent years that has investigated new supplementary drug options for OP treatment and support therapy, including progress in the development of enzymatic prophylaxis.",eng,Toxicology letters,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25595143,10.1093/heapol/czu134,Breast cancer in the global south and the limitations of a biomedical framing: a critical review of the literature.,"Public health researchers are devoting increasing attention to the growing burden of breast cancer in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), previously thought to be minimally impacted by this disease. A critical examination of this body of literature is needed to explore the assumptions, advantages and limitations of current approaches. In our critical literature review, we find that researchers and public health practitioners predominantly privilege a biomedical perspective focused on patients' adherence (or non-adherence) to 'preventive' practices, screening behaviours and treatment regimens. Cost-effective 'quick fixes' are prioritized, and prevention is framed in terms of individual 'risk behaviours'. Thus, individuals and communities are held responsible for the success of the biomedical system; traditional belief systems and 'harmful' social practices are problematized. Inherently personal, social and cultural experiences of pain and suffering are neglected or reduced to the issue of chemical palliation. This narrow approach obscures the complex aetiology of the disease and perpetuates silence around power relations. This article calls for a social justice-oriented interrogation of the role of power and inequity in the global breast cancer epidemic, which recognizes the agency and experiences of women (and men) who experience breast cancer in the global south.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Dengue, malaria, and enteric fever are common causes of fever in returning travelers and timely and appropriate treatment is important. However, differentiation is difficult without specific diagnostic tests.--NEW SECTION--A retrospective study was conducted at the National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) from April 2005 to March 2013. Febrile travelers returning from overseas who were diagnosed with dengue, malaria, or enteric fever were included in this study. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were compared for each diagnosis.--NEW SECTION--During the study period, 86 malaria, 85 dengue, and 31 enteric fever cases were identified. The mean age of the study cohort was 33.1 ± 12 years and 134 (66.3%) study participants were male. Asia was the most common area visited by returning travelers with fevers (89% of dengue, 18.6% of malaria, and 100% of enteric fever cases), followed by Africa (1.2% of dengue and 70.9% of malaria cases). Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were significantly different among each group with each diagnosis. Decision tree models revealed that returning from Africa and CRP levels <10 mg/L were factors specific for diagnosis of malaria and dengue fever, respectively.--NEW SECTION--Clinical manifestations, simple laboratory test results, and regions of travel are helpful to distinguish between dengue, malaria, and enteric fever in febrile returning travelers with non-specific symptoms.",eng,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Usually, men with metastatic disease will progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We aimed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tumor samples from non-castrated and castrated men from LNCaP Orthotopic xenograft models of prostate cancer and to study the mechanisms of CRPC.--NEW SECTION--In this work, GSE46218 containing 4 samples from non-castrated men and 4 samples from castrated men was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. We identified DEGs using limma Geoquery in R, the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) method in Bioconductor, and Bias methods, followed by constructing an integrated regulatory network involving DEGs, miRNAs, and TFs using Cytoscape. Then, we analyzed network motifs of the integrated gene regulatory network using FANMOD. We selected regulatory modules corresponding to network motifs from the integrated regulatory network by Perl script. We preformed gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in the regulatory modules using DAVID.--NEW SECTION--We identified total 443 DEGs. We built an integrated regulatory network, found three motifs (motif 1, motif 2 and motif 3), and got two function modules (module 1 corresponded to motif 1, and module 2 corresponded to motif 2). Several GO terms (such as regulation of cell proliferation, positive regulation of macromolecule metabolic process, phosphorylation, and phosphorus metabolic process) and two pathways (pathway in cancer and Melanoma) were enriched. Furthermore, some significant DEGs (such as CAV1, LYN, FGFR3 and FGFR3) were related to CPRC development.--NEW SECTION--These genes might play important roles in the development and progression of CRPC.",eng,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25589644,10.1128/JVI.03085-14,Hepatitis C virus-mediated enhancement of microRNA miR-373 impairs the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a serious global health problem and establishes chronic infection in a significant number of infected humans worldwide. Interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are amplified during HCV infection but fail to eliminate virus from the liver in a large number of infected patients, and the mechanism is not fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the control of many biological processes, including IFN signaling. To gain more insights into the role of cellular miRNAs in possible countermeasures of HCV for suppression of the host antiviral response, a miRNA array was performed by using primary human hepatocytes infected with in vitro cell culture-grown HCV. A group of miRNAs were modulated in HCV-infected primary human hepatocytes. We focused on miR-373, as this miRNA was significantly upregulated in HCV-infected primary human hepatocytes. Here, we analyzed the function of miR-373 in the context of HCV infection. HCV infection upregulates miR-373 expression in hepatocytes and HCV-infected liver biopsy specimens. Furthermore, we discovered that miR-373 directly targets Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and IFN-regulating factor 9 (IRF9), important factors in the IFN signaling pathway. The upregulation of miR-373 by HCV also inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation, which is involved in ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) complex formation and ISG expression. The knockdown of miR-373 in hepatocytes enhanced JAK1 and IRF9 expression and reduced HCV RNA replication. Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-373 is upregulated during HCV infection and negatively regulated the type I IFN signaling pathway by suppressing JAK1 and IRF9. Our results offer a potential therapeutic approach for antiviral intervention.--NEW SECTION--Chronic HCV infection is one of the major causes of end-stage liver disease worldwide. Although the recent introduction of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy is extremely encouraging, some infected individuals do not respond to this therapy. Furthermore, these drugs target HCV nonstructural proteins, and with selective pressure, the virus may develop a resistant strain. Therefore, understanding the impairment of IFN signals will help in designing additional therapeutic modalities. In this study, we provide evidence of HCV-mediated upregulation of miR-373 and show that miR-373 impairs IFN signaling by targeting JAK1/IRF9 molecules. The knockdown of miR-373 inhibited HCV replication by upregulating interferon-stimulating gene expression. Together, these results provided new mechanistic insights into the role of miR-373 in HCV infection and suggest a new potential target against HCV infection.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In 2010, this paradigm shifted when the United States Government brought forward unprecedented resources to support African medical schools. The grant, entitled the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) triggered a number of south-south collaborations between medical schools in Africa. This paper examines the goals of these partnerships and their impact on medical education and health workforce planning.--NEW SECTION--Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the Principal Investigators of the first four MEPI programmes that formed an in-country consortium. These interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded to identify common themes.--NEW SECTION--All of the consortia have prioritized efforts to increase the quality of medical education, support new schools in-country and strengthen relations with government. These in-country partnerships have enabled schools to pool and mobilize limited resources creatively and generate locally-relevant curricula based on best-practices. The established schools are helping new schools by training faculty and using grant funds to purchase learning materials for their students. The consortia have strengthened the dialogue between academia and policy-makers enabling evidence-based health workforce planning. All of the partnerships are expected to last well beyond the MEPI grant as a result of local ownership and institutionalization of collaborative activities.--NEW SECTION--The consortia described in this paper demonstrate a paradigm shift in the relationship between medical schools in four African countries. While schools in Africa have historically worked in silos, competing for limited resources, MEPI funding that was leveraged to form in-country partnerships has created a culture of collaboration, overriding the history of competition. The positive impact on the quality and efficiency of health workforce training suggests that future funding for global health education should prioritize such south-south collaborations.",eng,Human resources for health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The capacity to evolve and adapt makes successful treatment of infectious diseases and cancer difficult. Indeed, therapy resistance has become a key challenge for global health. Therefore, ideas of how to control evolving populations to overcome this threat are valuable. Here we use the mathematical concepts of stochastic optimal control to study what is needed to control evolving populations. Following established routes to calculate control strategies, we first study how a polymorphism can be maintained in a finite population by adaptively tuning selection. We then introduce a minimal model of drug resistance in a stochastically evolving cancer cell population and compute adaptive therapies. When decisions are in this manner based on monitoring the response of the tumor, this can outperform established therapy paradigms. For both case studies, we demonstrate the importance of high-resolution monitoring of the target population to achieve a given control objective, thus quantifying the intuition that to control, one must monitor.",eng,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

As VHFs are a global health concern, well-characterized animal models are essential for both the development of therapeutics and vaccines as well as for increasing our understanding of the molecular events that underlie viral pathogenesis. However, the paucity of reagents or platforms that are available for studying hamsters at a molecular level limits the ability to extract biological information from this important animal model. As such, there is a need to develop platforms/technologies for characterizing host responses of hamsters at a molecular level. To this end, we developed hamster-specific kinome peptide arrays to characterize the molecular host response of the Syrian golden hamster. After validating the functionality of the arrays using immune agonists of defined signaling mechanisms (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α), we characterized the host response in a hamster model of VHF based on Pichinde virus (PICV(1)) infection by performing temporal kinome analysis of lung tissue. Our analysis revealed key roles for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL) responses, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in the response to PICV infection. These findings were validated through phosphorylation-specific Western blot analysis. Overall, we have demonstrated that hamster-specific kinome arrays are a robust tool for characterizing the species-specific molecular host response in a VHF model.

25565507,10.1055/s-0034-1395274,Access to infertility care in the developing world: the family promotion gap.,"Infertility in resource-poor settings is an overlooked global health problem. Although scarce health care resources must be deployed thoughtfully, prioritization of resources may be different for recipient and donor countries, the latter of whom focus on maternal health care, prevention, and family planning. For women and couples with involuntary childlessness, the negative psychosocial, sociocultural, and economic consequences in low-income countries are severe, possibly more so than in most Western societies. Despite the local importance of infertility, few resources are committed to help advance infertility care in regions like sub-Saharan Africa. The worldwide prevalence of infertility is remarkably similar across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes infertility as a global health problem and established universal access to reproductive health care as one of the United Nation's Millennium Developmental Goals for 2015. Currently, access to infertility care is varied and is usually only attainable by the very wealthy in low-income countries. We provide an overview on the current state of access to infertility care in low-income countries such as in sub-Saharan Africa and a rationale for providing comprehensive reproductive care and possible solutions for providing cost-effective infertility services in these settings.",eng,Seminars in reproductive medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The purpose of this elective is to provide students with an opportunity to observe the health care and public health delivery systems in low-income countries, provide medical service and have a cross-cultural experience. Over the course of the past 35 years, 388 students have participated in this global health elective in more than 41 low-income countries. The most popular sites include the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, India, Kenya and Thailand. Overall, interest in this elective has persisted throughout the course of time, sometimes temporarily increasing or decreasing with outside factors, such as the events of 11 September 2001 and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. Recent annual applications for this elective have been as high as 44 out of a class of 200 students. Over the past 10 years, annual acceptance rates have varied, ranging from a low of 32 % in 2007-2008 to a high of 74 % in 2010-2011 and 2013-2014. Careful screening, including a written application, review of academic records and personal interviews has resulted in the selection of highly mature, adaptable and dedicated students who have performed well at overseas sites. Student rated satisfaction levels with this elective are almost universally high, with most rating it the best experience of their medical school years. Students undergo extensive preparation prior to their travel overseas, including a review of individual health and safety issues, travel and lodging, and the nature of the host country culture, health care system and assignment site. Downstate medical students are especially experienced in cross-cultural understanding because of the unusual diversity of the patient population in Brooklyn, and the diversity of local hospital staff and the medical school class. The Alumni Fund of the College of Medicine has steadfastly supported this elective with both a philosophical commitment and financial grants to help defray costs since the very early years. The Dr. Michael and Lona B. Kennéy Endowment, the Joshua H. Weiner endowment, and the LSK Foundation have also provided financial support for this elective. Throughout the course of this elective, overseas preceptors have willingly given of their time and institutional resources to make these experiences available and meaningful for our students.",eng,Journal of community health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Articles were sourced from CINAHL, Global Health, Health Source: Nursing and Academic Edition, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES and PsycINFO, all of which were accessed through EBSCOhost. The Cochrane Database was also searched to identify all eligible articles. PRISMA guidelines were followed and search terms and search strategy ensured all possible studies were identified for review.--NEW SECTION--Intervention studies were eligible for inclusion if they were: focused on overweight or obesity prevention, community-based, targeted adolescents (aged 10-19 years), reported a mental health or well-being measure, and included a comparison or control group. Studies that focused on specific adolescent groups or were treatment interventions were excluded from review. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines.--NEW SECTION--Primary outcomes were measures of mental health and well-being, including diagnostic and symptomatic measures. Secondary outcomes included adiposity or weight-related measures.--NEW SECTION--Seven studies met the inclusion criteria; one reported anxiety/depressive outcomes, two reported on self-perception well-being measures such as self-esteem and self-efficacy, and four studies reported outcomes of quality of life. Positive mental health outcomes demonstrated that following obesity prevention, interventions included a decrease in anxiety and improved health-related quality of life. Quality of evidence was graded as very low.--NEW SECTION--Although positive outcomes for mental health and well-being do exist, controlled evaluations of community-based obesity prevention interventions have not often included mental health measures (n=7). It is recommended that future interventions incorporate mental health and well-being measures to identify any potential mechanisms influencing adolescent weight-related outcomes, and equally to ensure interventions are not causing harm to adolescent mental health.",eng,BMJ open,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25562861,10.7205/MILMED-D-14-00171,MOE vs. M&E: considering the difference between measuring strategic effectiveness and monitoring tactical evaluation.,"Measuring the effectiveness of military Global Health Engagements (GHEs) has become an area of increasing interest to the military medical field. As a result, there have been efforts to more logically and rigorously evaluate GHE projects and programs; many of these have been based on the Logic and Results Frameworks. However, while these Frameworks are apt and appropriate planning tools, they are not ideally suited to measuring programs' effectiveness. This article introduces military medicine professionals to the Measures of Effectiveness for Defense Engagement and Learning (MODEL) program, which implements a new method of assessment, one that seeks to rigorously use Measures of Effectiveness (vs. Measures of Performance) to gauge programs' and projects' success and fidelity to Theater Campaign goals. While the MODEL method draws on the Logic and Results Frameworks where appropriate, it goes beyond their planning focus by using the latest social scientific and econometric evaluation methodologies to link on-the-ground GHE ""lines of effort"" to the realization of national and strategic goals and end-states. It is hoped these methods will find use beyond the MODEL project itself, and will catalyze a new body of rigorous, empirically based work, which measures the effectiveness of a broad spectrum of GHE and security cooperation activities. We based our strategies on the principle that it is much more cost-effective to prevent conflicts than it is to stop one once it's started. I cannot overstate the importance of our theater security cooperation programs as the centerpiece to securing our Homeland from the irregular and catastrophic threats of the 21st Century.-GEN James L.

Plumbagin is a plant-derived naphthoquinone, a natural product that exhibits antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. In the present study, we investigated the antimicrobial effects of plumbagin against Bacillus subtilis using two complementary proteomics techniques: two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). Comparative quantitative proteomics analysis of plumbagin treated and untreated control samples identified differential expression of 230 proteins (1% FDR, 1.5 fold-change and ≥2 peptides) in B. subtilis after plumbagin treatment. Pathway analysis involving the differentially expressed proteins suggested that plumbagin effectively increases heme and protein biosynthesis, whereas fatty acid synthesis was significantly reduced. Gene expression and metabolic activity assays further corroborated the proteomics findings. We anticipate that plumbagin blocks the cell division by altering the membrane permeability required for energy generation. This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, offering new insights, at proteome level, for the putative mode(s) of action of plumbagin and attendant cellular targets in B. subtilis. The findings also suggest new ways forward for the modern omics-guided drug target discovery, building on traditional plant medicine.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25561926,NA,In-silico Metabolome Target Analysis Towards PanC-based Antimycobacterial Agent Discovery.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the main cause of tuberculosis (TB), has still remained a global health crisis especially in developing countries. Tuberculosis treatment is a laborious and lengthy process with high risk of noncompliance, cytotoxicity adverse events and drug resistance in patient. Recently, there has been an alarming rise of drug resistant in TB. In this regard, it is an unmet need to develop novel antitubercular medicines that target new or more effective biochemical pathways to prevent drug resistant Mycobacterium. Integrated study of metabolic pathways through in-silico approach played a key role in antimycobacterial design process in this study. Our results suggest that pantothenate synthetase (PanC), anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase (TrpD) and 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase (LeuD) might be appropriate drug targets. In the next step, in-silico ligand analysis was used for more detailed study of chemical tractability of targets. This was helpful to identify pantothenate synthetase (PanC, Rv3602c) as the best target for antimycobacterial design procedure. Virtual library screening on the best ligand of PanC was then performed for inhibitory ligand design. At the end, five chemical intermediates showed significant inhibition of Mycobacterium bovis with good selectivity indices (SI) ≥10 according to Tuberculosis Antimicrobial Acquisition & Coordinating Facility of US criteria for antimycobacterial screening programs.",eng,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The etiologies of preterm birth are complex and multifactorial. To examine risk factors related to preterm birth, a matched case-control study was conducted in a hospital in Beijing, China where little data on preterm birth have been published in the scientific literature.--NEW SECTION--A 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted in 172 pairs of women with preterm birth (case group) and term delivery (control group). Eligible subjects were interviewed in person by well-trained investigators using a questionnaire. Information on obstetric diagnosis and newborns were abstracted from inpatients' medical records. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression models were used to measure the associations between related factors and preterm birth.--NEW SECTION--Univariate analysis showed that 6 of 12 factors were associated with preterm birth. Multivariate results showed that gestational hypertension (OR = 7.76), low gestational weight gain (OR = 3.02), frequent prenatal care (OR = 0.16), balanced diet (OR = 0.36), and high gestational weight gain (OR = 0.41) were associated with preterm birth.--NEW SECTION--This study provides information on preterm birth in Beijing, China, and it also lends support to existing evidence about the role of maternal nutritional status, prenatal care and gestational hypertension as risk factors for preterm birth.",eng,Reproductive health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25560838,10.1111/jvh.12371,Estimates on HCV disease burden worldwide - filling the gaps.,"Hepatitis C is caused by infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and represents a major global health burden. Persistent HCV infection can lead to progressive liver disease with the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, possibly accounting for up to 0.5 million deaths every year. Treatment of HCV infection is undergoing a profound and radical change. As new treatments are extremely safe and effective, there are virtually no medical reasons to withhold therapy. Yet, the new therapies are expensive. As resources are limited, solid data to estimate the disease burden caused by HCV are urgently needed. Epidemiology data and disease burden analyses for 16 countries are presented. For almost all countries, the peak of HCV-related cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death is a decade or more away. However, a surprising heterogeneity in country-specific HCV-associated disease burden exists. Also, HCV diagnosis and treatment uptake varied markedly between countries. A consistent finding was that a reduction of HCV liver-related mortality is dependent on access to therapy. Increasing efficacy of therapy alone with a constant numbers of treatments will not have a major impact on the HCV-related disease burden. The data presented here should inform public health policy and help drive advocacy for enhanced strategic investment and action. HCV kills patients, and the disease burden will continue to rise in most countries unless action is taken soon. Chronic HCV is a curable infection and a reversible liver disease. Fortunately, the tools to eliminate HCV are now available.",eng,Journal of viral hepatitis,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for ceftriaxone is determined by E-test.--NEW SECTION--Data were expressed as percentages. The differences in percentages were tested for statistical significance by using χ2 test and P values were determined.--NEW SECTION--The percentage of penicillinase producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG) increased from 8% in 1995-96 to 20% in 2004-05 and 88% in 2011-2013. Quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (QRNG) showed a significant increase from 12% in 1995-96 to 98.3% in 2004-05, while 84% isolates were found to be QRNG by 2011-2013.

25557033,10.1016/j.jep.2014.12.026,Manufacturing risk: reframing the discourse of safety of commodified potent substances.,"The rapid commodification of plant-based medicines has led to the development of regulatory guidelines and standards by the World Health Organization to ensure the safety of these products. However, these standards have been identified to be selectively implemented, if implemented at all, in many contexts. A primary concern for proving the safety of intrinsic factors of plant-based medicines, may result in less attention paid to the often more problematic extrinsic factors of mass production. This article critically examines the normative global discourse of safety concerning plant-based medicines and problematises many of the assumptions identified in this discourse.--NEW SECTION--This qualitative research was conducted in the Traditional Medicine Unit of the Western Pacific Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) and in field work in the rural Philippines. Data was collected through archival research, analysis of WHO data sets, semi-structured and structured interviews and surveys, participant observation concerning local plant-based medicine use in the Philippines and participant observation in WHO meetings regarding future strategies for traditional Asian medicines.--NEW SECTION--Although informants reported concerns of safety for every aspect of the production, marketing and sales of plant-based medicines, this research has identified that the implementation (WHO guidelines) has been uneven and inconsistent over the past ten years in the Western Pacific Region of the WHO. Differences in local contexts that are not consistent with global guidelines and standards were reported by informants. Issues have also been identified in the inconsistent regulation of plant-based medicines as pharmaceuticals within only certain, rather than all, processes of production.--NEW SECTION--It is imperative to understand plant-based medicines as the potent substances they are, whose rapid global commodification may affect both their potency and safety. The WHO discourse of the need for safety in the use of plant-based medicines has justified the need for biomedical oversight through processes of commodification. Yet, it is often through these very processes of commodification and mass production that safety may be compromised. This research suggests that the discourse concerning the safety of the plant-based medicines needs to be reframed from a primary focus on the intrinsic factors of plant-based medicines to a greater focus on the extrinsic factors of global commodification.",eng,Journal of ethnopharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Both the World Bank and the World Health Organization have designated UHC as a core objective, but many details of this concept have yet to be specified, including the political economy process by which countries can increase financial protection to move toward UHC. Using an analysis of historical literature, this paper examines the development of the two common mechanisms for providing financial risk protection: national social health insurance as developed in Germany, and general tax revenue as used by the United Kingdom to launch the National Health Service. Because of the prominence of organized labor groups in demanding increased financial protection in these two cases, the paper then considers a comparison case from the Progressive Era in the United States where labor groups were far less engaged. Based on the categories used in the historical literature, I develop a framework for comparing the cases in six areas: related legal and cultural heritage; macro-historical conditions; demand for increased social protection; politics of expanding government role in health; financing and delivery systems; and UHC-related outcomes. The paper concludes with some reflections from this analysis for low- and middle-income countries attempting to move toward UHC.",eng,Health systems and reform,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We combined i) a quantitative exploration of the usage statistics of research-related words and constructs, citations of types of evidence, and budgets allocated to research-related activities; and (ii) an interpretive exploration using a deductive thematic analysis approach to uncover changes in the institutions, interests, ideas, and external factors displaying the country climate for EIHSP. Descriptive statistics compared quantitative data across countries during the periods 2001-2006 and 2007-2012.--NEW SECTION--We reviewed 54 documents, including 33 grants approved by global health initiatives. The usage statistics of research-related words and constructs showed an increase over time across countries. Varied forms of data, information, or research were instrumentally used to describe the burden and determinants of poverty and health conditions. The use of evidence syntheses to frame poverty and health problems, select strategies, or forecast the expected outcomes has remained sparse over time and across countries. The budgets for research increased over time from 28.496 to 95.467 million Euros (335%) in Cameroon and 38.064 to 58.884 million US dollars (155%) in Uganda, with most resources allocated to health sector performance monitoring and evaluation. The consistent naming of elements pertaining to the climate for EIHSP features the greater influence of external donors through policy transfer.--NEW SECTION--This structured review of governmental policy documents illustrates the nascent conducive climate for EIHSP in Cameroon and Uganda and the persistent undervalue of evidence syntheses.

The scale-up of HIV-related treatment options and broader reach of programming for HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women is likely to have decreased maternal mortality. This systematic review synthesized evidence on interventions that have directly reduced mortality among this population.--NEW SECTION--Studies published between January 1, 2003 and November 30, 2014 were searched using PubMed. Of the 1,373 records screened, 19 were included in the analysis.--NEW SECTION--Interventions identified through the review include antiretroviral therapy (ART), micronutrients (multivitamins, vitamin A, and selenium), and antibiotics. ART during pregnancy was shown to reduce mortality. Timing of ART initiation, duration of treatment, HIV disease status, and ART discontinuation after pregnancy influence mortality reduction. Incident pregnancy in women already on ART for their health appears not to have adverse consequences for the mother. Multivitamin use was shown to reduce disease progression while other micronutrients and antibiotics had no beneficial effect on maternal mortality.--NEW SECTION--ART was the only intervention identified that decreased death in HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women. The findings support global trends in encouraging initiation of lifelong ART for all HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women (Option B+), regardless of their CD4+ count, as an important step in ensuring appropriate care and treatment.--NEW SECTION--Maternal mortality is a rare event that highlights challenges in measuring the impact of interventions on mortality.

Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to estimate the associations between covariates and obesity and BMI.--NEW SECTION--Overall, 28.1% in the sample were obese and the mean BMI was 27.6 kg/m(2). In adjusted models, we found that older age, non-Hispanic Black race, lower education and income levels, Midwestern and Southern region of residence, former smoking, infrequent alcohol use, physical inactivity, consumption of less fruits, vegetables, brown rice and more cheese, fried potato and meat, were associated with obesity. These factors were also associated with higher BMI, along with male gender and higher consumption of meat, fried potatoes and cheese.--NEW SECTION--The association of many of the socio-demographic and behavioral factors with obesity and higher BMI found in our study was consistent with previous findings. Persistence of such associations suggest a need for better understanding of the underlying mechanism as well as for evaluation of the current programs and policies targeted at reducing the obesity burden in the United States. In view of the rising global obesity epidemic, especially in the low- and middle-income countries, our findings could help guide development of effective health and social policies and programs aimed at reducing the obesity burden in other parts of the world.",eng,International journal of MCH and AIDS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We investigated the overall and independent associations between exclusive breastfeeding and under-five mortality in 57 low- and-middle-income countries.--NEW SECTION--Data were obtained from the latest World Health Organization, United Nations, and United Nations Children's Fund databases for 57 low- and middle-income countries covering the periods 2006-2014. Multivariate linear regression was used to estimate the effects of exclusive breastfeeding on under-five mortality after adjusting for differences in socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related factors.--NEW SECTION--In multivariate models, exclusive breastfeeding was independently associated with under-five mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic and health systems-related factors. A 10 percentage-points increase in exclusive breastfeeding was associated with a reduction of 5 child deaths per 1,000 live births. A one-unit increase in Human Development Index was associated with a decrease of 231 under-five child deaths per 1,000 live births. A $100 increase in per capita health care expenditure was associated with a decrease of 2 child deaths per 1,000 live births. One unit increase in physician density was associated with 2.8 units decrease in the under-five mortality rate.--NEW SECTION--Population-level health system and socioeconomic factors exert considerable effect on the association between exclusive breastfeeding and under-five mortality. Given that the health policy and socioeconomic indicators shown to influence exclusive breastfeeding and under-five mortality are modifiable, policy makers could potentially target specific policies and programs to address national-level deficiencies in these sectors to reduce under-five mortality in their countries.",eng,International journal of MCH and AIDS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
27621998,10.21106/ijma.51,Disparities in Health Care Quality Indicators among US Children with Special Health Care Needs According to Household Language Use.,"Lower health care utilization and less favorable health outcomes have been demonstrated in children from Non-English Primary Language households (NEPL) in previous studies. This study examines prevalence of health care quality indicators among US children with special health care needs (CSHCN) and their association with household language use.--NEW SECTION--We used data from the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, restricted to an analytic sample of 40,242 children. Logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of primary household language on the attainment of the 6 health care quality indicators for CSHCN.--NEW SECTION--Compared to CSHCN from English primary language households (EPL), CSHCN from NEPL households had 31% higher odds of not feeling like partners in health care decision-making. They had 67% higher odds of lacking care through a medical home and 42% higher odds of reporting inadequate health insurance. NEPL children had 32% higher odds of not receiving early and continuous screening for special health care needs. NEPL youths had 69% higher odds of not receiving services for transition to adulthood. Minority race/ethnicity, lower income and families other than two biological parents all conferred additional risks to not attaining quality indicators. Publicly insured or uninsured CSHCN were also at higher risk.--NEW SECTION--Our study provides compelling evidence that significant disparities exist for CSHCN by primary household language status across all health care quality indicators. Establishment of effective surveillance systems and targeting of outreach programs in both developed and developing countries may lead to improved understanding of health care needs and quality of services and reduction of health disparities for this underserved population.",eng,International journal of MCH and AIDS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

It also serves as a way of assessing the effectiveness of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) in health care facilities.--NEW SECTION--This was a 5-year prospective cross-sectional study at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, (EkSUTH) Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria. Babies delivered to HIV-positive mothers who presented at EkSUTH between January 2010 and December 2014 were enrolled in the present study. PCR was done twice for all HIV-exposed infants. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 16.0.--NEW SECTION--One hundred and fifty eight infants were HIV exposed; 72 males and 86 females (M:F= 0.84:1). Eighty eight (55.7%) of the mothers had commenced highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) before pregnancy, 56 (35.4%) during pregnancy, and 14 (8.9%) after delivery. Ten (6.3%) babies tested positive. Four (28.6%) of 14 exposed babies whose mothers commenced HAART after delivery tested positive to HIV compared to 3 (5.4%) of 56 babies whose mother commenced HAART during pregnancy and 3 (3.4%) of 88 babies whose mother commenced HAART before pregnancy. The difference was statistically significant (c(2) = 13.28, df = 4, p = 0.01).--NEW SECTION--There is significant reduction in transmission of HIV from mothers to children with commencement of antiretroviral drugs before pregnancy in mothers and use of Nevirapine for all exposed babies for the first 6 weeks of life.

Our study objective is to examine the associations between household language among children with ASD and national health quality indicators attainment.--NEW SECTION--We conducted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses using cross-sectional data from the publicly-available 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) to investigate the association between household language use and quality indicators of medical home, adequate insurance, and early and continuous screening.--NEW SECTION--Approximately, 28% of parents of children with ASD from non-English primary language (NEPL) households reported their child having severe ASD as compared with 13% of parents from English primary language (EPL) households. Older children were more likely to have care that met the early and continuous screening quality indicator, while lower income children and uninsured children were less likely to have met this indicator.--NEW SECTION--Despite the lack of differences in the attainment of quality indicators by household language, the higher severity found in children in NEPL households suggests that they are exceptionally vulnerable. Enhanced early screening and identification for these children and supporting their parents in navigating the complex US health care delivery system would increase their participation in early intervention services. Immigration of children with special health care needs from around the world to the US has been increasing from countries with diverse healthcare systems. Our findings will help to inform policies and interventions to reduce health disparities for children with ASD from immigrant populations. As the prevalence of ASD has increased worldwide, understanding of the condition and care-seeking behavior in migrant populations is especially valuable.",eng,International journal of MCH and AIDS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
27621994,NA,PEPFAR Funding and Reduction in HIV Infection Rates in 12 Focus Sub-Saharan African Countries: A Quantitative Analysis.,"HIV and AIDS continue to have a calamitous effect on individuals living on the continent of Africa. U.S. President George W. Bush implemented the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) with the objective of committing approximately $15 billion from 2004 through 2008 to assist with the reduction of the HIV pandemic worldwide. The majority of the PEPFAR policy and funding focused on 12 countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. The policy question this research paper seeks to analyze is whether the PEPFAR funding (as a % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) allocated to the 12 countries in Africa had any effect on the decrease of HIV infection rates of males and females between the ages of 15 and 49.--NEW SECTION--A fixed-effects panel regression analysis was conducted to determine if this association exists. This study examined the 12 African countries that received PEPFAR funding over the years 2002 to 2010; even though PEPFAR was only active from 2004 through 2008, this research included two years prior and two years after this timeframe in order to better estimate the effect of PEPFAR funding on HIV reduction.--NEW SECTION--The results illustrate that on average, ceteris paribus, for every 1 percentage point increase in PEPFAR funding per GDP a country received, the country's HIV infection rate decreased by 0.355 percentage points.--NEW SECTION--While the empirical findings in this study suggested that the correlation between PEPFAR funding and HIV reduction is statistically significant, the practical significance is perhaps less obvious. Arguably, the reduction rate should be higher given the extent of funding targeted to this project. The conclusion of this research provides suggestions on future research and the policy implications of PEPFAR.",eng,International journal of MCH and AIDS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Log-linear, weighted least squares, and Cox regression were used to analyze mortality trends and differentials.--NEW SECTION--During 1969-2011, CVD mortality rates declined fastest in New England and Mid-Atlantic regions and slowest in the Southeast and Southwestern regions. In 1969, the mortality rate was 9% higher in the Southeast than in New England, but the differential increased to 48% in 2011. In 2011, Southeastern states, Mississippi and Alabama, had the highest CVD mortality rates, nearly twice the rates for Minnesota and Hawaii. Controlling for individual-level covariates reduced state differentials. State- and county-level differentials in CVD mortality rates widened over time as geographical disparity in CVD mortality increased by 50% between 1969 and 2011. Area deprivation, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes prevalence, urbanization, lack of health insurance, and lower access to primary medical care were all significant predictors of county-level CVD mortality rates and accounted for 52.7% of the county variance.--NEW SECTION--Although CVD mortality has declined for all geographical areas in the United States, geographical disparity has widened over time as certain regions and states, particularly those in the South, have lagged behind in mortality reduction. Geographical disparities in CVD mortality reflect inequalities in socioeconomic conditions and behavioral risk factors. With the global CVD burden on the rise, monitoring geographical disparities, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, could indicate the extent to which reductions in CVD mortality are achievable and may help identify effective policy strategies for CVD prevention and control.",eng,International journal of MCH and AIDS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Rate ratios and log-linear and Cox regression were used to model mortality trends and differentials.--NEW SECTION--Area socioeconomic gradients in mortality from CVD, heart disease, and stroke increased substantially during the study period. Compared to those in the most affluent group, individuals in the most deprived area group had, respectively 35%, 29%, and 73% higher CVD, heart disease, and stroke mortality in 1969, but 120-121% higher mortality in 2007-2011. Gradients were steeper for women than for men. Education, income, and occupation were inversely associated with CVD, heart disease, and stroke mortality, with individual-level socioeconomic gradients being steeper during 1990-2002 than in 1979-1989. Individuals with low education and incomes had 2.7 to 3.7 times higher CVD, heart disease, and stroke mortality risks than their counterparts with high education and income levels.--NEW SECTION--Although mortality declined for all US groups during 1969-2011, socioeconomic disparities in mortality from CVD, heart disease and stroke remained marked and increased over time because of faster declines in mortality among higher socioeconomic groups. Widening disparities in mortality may reflect increasing temporal areal inequalities in living conditions, behavioral risk factors such as smoking, obesity and physical inactivity, and access to and use of health services. With social inequalities and prevalence of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity on the rise, most segments of the working-age population in low- and middle-income countries will likely experience increased cardiovascular-disease burden in terms of higher morbidity and mortality rates.",eng,International journal of MCH and AIDS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Rate ratios and log-linear regression were used to model mortality trends and differentials.--NEW SECTION--Between 1969 and 2013, CVD mortality rates decreased by 2.66% per year for whites and 2.12% for blacks. Racial disparities and socioeconomic gradients in CVD mortality increased substantially during the study period. In 2013, blacks had 30% higher CVD mortality than whites and 113% higher mortality than Asians/Pacific Islanders. Compared to those in the most affluent group, individuals in the most deprived area group had 11% higher CVD mortality in 1969 but 40% higher mortality in 2007-2011. Education, income, and occupation were inversely associated with CVD mortality in both men and women. Men and women with low education and incomes had 46-76% higher CVD mortality risks than their counterparts with high education and income levels. Men in clerical, service, farming, craft, repair, construction, and transport occupations, and manual laborers had 30-58% higher CVD mortality risks than those employed in executive and managerial occupations.--NEW SECTION--Socioeconomic and racial disparities in CVD mortality are marked and have increased over time because of faster declines in mortality among the affluent and majority populations. Disparities in CVD mortality may reflect inequalities in the social environment, behavioral risk factors such as smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, disease prevalence, and healthcare access and treatment. With rising prevalence of many chronic disease risk factors, the global burden of cardiovascular diseases is expected to increase further, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where over 80% of all CVD deaths occur.",eng,International journal of MCH and AIDS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This study evaluates the effects of nutrition education on mothers' knowledge and whether increase in mothers' knowledge was associated with increase in growth of their children in Ardabil, Iran.--NEW SECTION--A quasi-experimental study of the impact of written nutritional education and in-person nutritional education given to the participants (mothers) from urban health centers by health workers and health volunteers. Sixteen urban health centers located in Ardabil, Iran, were selected randomly for nutritional education. A group of 303 mothers with infants younger than 6 months of age from 16 health centers participated in this study.

Rates, rate ratios, and ordinary least squares (OLS) and Poisson regression were used to analyze international variation in mortality.--NEW SECTION--Mortality rates among youth aged 15-34 years varied from a low of 28.4 deaths per 100,000 population for Hong Kong to a high of 250.6 for Russia and 619.1 for South Africa. For men aged 15-34, Singapore and Hong Kong had the lowest mortality rates (≈40 per 100,000), compared with South Africa and Russia with rates of 589.7 and 383.3, respectively. Global patterns in mortality among women were similar. Youth aged 15-24 in South Africa had 14 times higher mortality and those in the Philippines, Mexico, Russia, Colombia, and Brazil had 5-7 times higher mortality than those in Hong Kong. Youth aged 25-34 in Russia and South Africa had, respectively, 10 and 29 times higher mortality than their counterparts in Hong Kong. United States (US) had the 12th highest mortality rate among youth aged 15-24 and the 13th highest rate among youth aged 25-34. Overall, the US youth had 2-3 times higher rates of mortality than their counterparts in many industrialized countries including Hong Kong, Singapore, Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, and Sweden.

Working women in India constitute a dominant and expanding pool of mothers. There is paucity of research focused on feeding behavior within this group.--NEW SECTION--One hundred and fifty working women answered a structured questionnaire about their demographics, birth history, levels of awareness and practice of feeding guidelines, and perceptions about breastfeeding and counseling. Data analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.--NEW SECTION--Majority of participants belonged to 21-39 years age group, had nuclear families, received college education, and delivered in institutional setups. Gaps were observed between the mother's levels of awareness and practice for different tenets of national guidelines. Higher education, longer maternity leave, higher income, and utilization of counseling services facilitated adoption of optimal feeding behavior. Most women perceived breast milk to be superior to any alternative and favored provision of counseling during last trimester.--NEW SECTION--Counseling women on optimal feeding behavior is a potential intervention to convert its awareness into actual practice.

27189668,10.1038/nrdp.2015.25,Asthma.,"Asthma is the most common inflammatory disease of the lungs. The prevalence of asthma is increasing in many parts of the world that have adopted aspects of the Western lifestyle, and the disease poses a substantial global health and economic burden. Asthma involves both the large-conducting and the small-conducting airways, and is characterized by a combination of inflammation and structural remodelling that might begin in utero. Disease progression occurs in the context of a developmental background in which the postnatal acquisition of asthma is strongly linked with allergic sensitization. Most asthma cases follow a variable course, involving viral-induced wheezing and allergen sensitization, that is associated with various underlying mechanisms (or endotypes) that can differ between individuals. Each set of endotypes, in turn, produces specific asthma characteristics that evolve across the lifecourse of the patient. Strong genetic and environmental drivers of asthma interconnect through novel epigenetic mechanisms that operate prenatally and throughout childhood. Asthma can spontaneously remit or begin de novo in adulthood, and the factors that lead to the emergence and regression of asthma, irrespective of age, are poorly understood. Nonetheless, there is mounting evidence that supports a primary role for structural changes in the airways with asthma acquisition, on which altered innate immune mechanisms and microbiota interactions are superimposed. On the basis of the identification of new causative pathways, the subphenotyping of asthma across the lifecourse of patients is paving the way for more-personalized and precise pathway-specific approaches for the prevention and treatment of asthma, creating the real possibility of total prevention and cure for this chronic inflammatory disease.",eng,Nature reviews.

27189025,10.1038/nrdp.2015.19,Type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an expanding global health problem, closely linked to the epidemic of obesity. Individuals with T2DM are at high risk for both microvascular complications (including retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications (such as cardiovascular comorbidities), owing to hyperglycaemia and individual components of the insulin resistance (metabolic) syndrome. Environmental factors (for example, obesity, an unhealthy diet and physical inactivity) and genetic factors contribute to the multiple pathophysiological disturbances that are responsible for impaired glucose homeostasis in T2DM. Insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion remain the core defects in T2DM, but at least six other pathophysiological abnormalities contribute to the dysregulation of glucose metabolism. The multiple pathogenetic disturbances present in T2DM dictate that multiple antidiabetic agents, used in combination, will be required to maintain normoglycaemia. The treatment must not only be effective and safe but also improve the quality of life. Several novel medications are in development, but the greatest need is for agents that enhance insulin sensitivity, halt the progressive pancreatic β-cell failure that is characteristic of T2DM and prevent or reverse the microvascular complications.

I agree that global health research should strengthen its contribution to generating such knowledge by drawing more on political science, such research is gaining ground. Even more important is - as Ooms indicates - that global health scholars better understand their own role in the political process.

But why would these aspects be either unconscious or unacknowledged? In this commentary, I argue that the 'unconscious' and 'unacknowledged' nature of the norms, politics and power that drive global health is a direct byproduct of the processes through which power operates, and a primary mechanism by which power sustains and reinforces itself. To identify what is unconscious and unacknowledged requires more than broadening the disciplinary base of global health research to those social sciences with deep traditions of thought in the domains of power, politics and norms, albeit that doing so is a fundamental first step.

Effective leadership is an issue which cannot be overemphasized as part of management capacity in resource deprived settings as difficult settings require leadership skills in order to achieve managerial success. A primary issue of importance highlighted in the editorial is country ownership of management effectiveness initiatives, which may be very difficult when the health sector is dependent on support and funding from donors and influential partners, who drive change often without a good understanding of the context.

Cutoff points are usually based on arbitrary percentile values. We aimed to identify optimal cutoff points for six QoL scales and to quantify their added utility in the performance of four prognostic classifications in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).--NEW SECTION--We reanalyzed data of 271 patients with advanced HCC recruited between July 2002 and October 2003 from 79 institutions in France in the CHOC trial, designed to assess the efficacy of long-acting octreotide. QoL was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30). The scores ranged from 0 to 100. Identification of optimal cutoff points was based on the method of Faraggi and Simon [Stat Med 1996;15:2203-2213]. Improvement in the performance of prognostic classifications was studied with Harrell's C-index, the net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).--NEW SECTION--We found that optimal cutoff points were 50 for global health, 58.33 for physical functioning, 66.67 for role functioning, 66.67 for fatigue, 0 for dyspnea, and 33.33 for diarrhea. The addition of QoL and clinical factors improved the performance of all four prognostic classifications, with improvement in the range of 0.02-0.09 for the C-index, 0.24-0.78 for 3-month NRI, and 0.02-0.10 for IDI.--NEW SECTION--These cutoff values for QoL scales can be useful to identify HCC patients with very poor prognosis and thus improve design of clinical trials and treatment adjustment for these patients.",eng,The oncologist,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We therefore examined whether stimulating intracellular killing of mycobacteria through pharmacological enhancement of macroautophagy might provide a novel therapeutic strategy. Despite the resistance of MTB to killing by basal autophagy, cell-based screening of FDA-approved drugs revealed two anticonvulsants, carbamazepine and valproic acid, that were able to stimulate autophagic killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis within primary human macrophages at concentrations achievable in humans. Using a zebrafish model, we show that carbamazepine can stimulate autophagy in vivo and enhance clearance of M. marinum, while in mice infected with a highly virulent multidrug-resistant MTB strain, carbamazepine treatment reduced bacterial burden, improved lung pathology and stimulated adaptive immunity. We show that carbamazepine induces antimicrobial autophagy through a novel, evolutionarily conserved, mTOR-independent pathway controlled by cellular depletion of myo-inositol. While strain-specific differences in susceptibility to in vivo carbamazepine treatment may exist, autophagy enhancement by repurposed drugs provides an easily implementable potential therapy for the treatment of multidrug-resistant mycobacterial infection.",eng,EMBO molecular medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Although the use of glucose-lowering agents is routinely practiced, high dependence on medication leads to poor quality of life for DM patients. While it is still not feasible to precisely determine the critical timing when DM is truly established, perhaps the best way to reduce DM-associated mortality is to prevent it. To this end, an exploration of prognostic molecules sensitive enough to detect early physiological alteration at the initiating stage would be required. Recently discovered small noncoding molecules, microRNAs (miRs), in body fluid seem promising to be utilized as a biomarker to monitor DM initiation and progression, as it is believed that expression of circulating miRs reflects disease pathology. Current DM-related miRs were often referred to miRs differentially expressed in insulin target organs (liver, muscle, and adipose tissues) or circulating blood (peripheral blood) in diabetic patients compared to their control counterparts, although these miRs could merely be resultant nucleotides from DM-induced organ impairment instead of the indicators of onset/progression of DM.

While the current system is inadequate to manage the burden of disease, these inadequacies may be exacerbated at times by post-operative complications resulting from well-intentioned surgical missions.--NEW SECTION--This case illustrates many difficulties in caring for individuals in the developing world, raising several questions: (1) How can complications be prevented in the future? (2) What are possible ways of managing complications with resources at hand once it occurs? (3) What resources are needed to minimize patient? Ideally an international forum can help provide descriptions of issues and problems that are encountered so as to increase awareness and identify potential solutions.",eng,International journal of surgery case reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25523889,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2014.10.012,Toward safe accessibility of opioid pain medicines in Vietnam and other developing countries: a balanced policy method.,"Moderate or severe pain is common among people with advanced cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. Yet despite agreement that pain relief is a human right, the poorest 80% of the world's population rarely have access to strong opioid analgesics. Excessively restrictive opioid policies, especially in developing countries, both stem from and propagate misguided fears about opioids, so-called opiophobia. Because opiophobia, like any norm, is historically, socially, and culturally situated, efforts to change opiophobic policies will be most effective if guided by awareness of their historical, social, and cultural determinants. We describe some of these determinants in Vietnam and report on results of an ongoing project there to allay opiophobia and improve safe access to opioids for medical uses. We used a method that entails working with committed local partners, including a high-level official from the Ministry of Health, to review all Vietnamese policies governing opioid accessibility to identify the barriers; devising an action plan to safely reduce or circumnavigate the barriers; obtaining buy-in for the plan from all stakeholders, including drug regulators and the police; and assisting the Ministry of Health to implement the plan. Since the start of the project, morphine consumption has increased each year and as of 2010 was ninefold greater than in 2003, and the number of hospitals offering palliative care has increased from three to 15. We conclude that this balanced policy method appears to be helping to reduce barriers to opioid access in Vietnam and should be used in other developing countries.",eng,Journal of pain and symptom management,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Preliminary research data suggest that acupuncture may have an influence on metabolic parameters related to obesity.--NEW SECTION--To determine the electroacupuncture (EA) protocol to be used in a future clinical trial examining the effect of acupuncture on metabolic parameters related to obesity and to examine whether a single EA treatment can change fasting blood glucose in obese subjects.--NEW SECTION--16 obese women aged 30-52 years with body mass index >30 kg/m(2) were assigned consecutively into three groups and their fasting blood glucose was measured before and after administering a single session, lasting 30 min, of one of three EA treatment protocols. The Dorsal group received EA to dorsal segmental acupuncture points BL18-23 bilaterally (corresponding to the segmental levels innervating the pancreas); the Ear group received EA to ear points in the cavum conchae; and the Limb group received EA to points in the arms and legs (LI10-LI11, ST36-Zongping).--NEW SECTION--After a single session of EA there was a statistically significant decrease in fasting blood glucose in the Dorsal and Limb groups, but there was no change and even a trend towards an increase in the glucose level in the Ear group.--NEW SECTION--The findings of this small pilot study suggest that EA to either dorsal segmental points corresponding to the pancreas or to muscle points in all four limbs may exert a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism in obese women.",eng,Acupuncture in medicine : journal of the British Medical Acupuncture Society,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

It begins with an exploration of what it might mean to say that health professionals practise good medical ethics as part of practising good ethical medicine. Using the example of the Genethics Club, a well-established national ethics forum for genetics professionals in the UK, the paper develops an account of moral craftsmanship grounded in the concepts of shared moral commitments and practices, moral work, ethics and living morality. In the light of this discussion, the paper goes on to consider what it might mean for a specialist in medical ethics, a bioethicist, to do good medical ethics. Finally, a research agenda focusing on the challenges of thinking about good medical ethics in a global context and a proposal for an innovative approach to bioethics methodology is outlined.",eng,Journal of medical ethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Globalisation has also increased pandemics, and disparate health system conditions mean that where one falls ill or is injured in the world can mean the difference between quality care, substandard care or no care at all, between full recovery, permanent ill effects and death. Yet attention to the normative underpinnings of global health justice and distribution remains, despite some important exceptions, inadequate in medical ethics, bioethics and political philosophy. We need a theoretical foundation on which to build a more just world.

Quality was based on the World Health Organization-Africa Region checklist.--NEW SECTION--Of the 954 laboratories identified (a density of one laboratory per 1,781 persons), 779 (82%) performed only simple kit tests or light microscope examinations. The 95% (907/954) of laboratories for whom volumes were obtained performed an average aggregate of 13,189 tests daily, for a test utilization rate of around 2 tests per individual per year. Laboratories could be segregated into eight groups based on quality, test volume, and complexity. However, 90% of the testing was performed by just two groups: (1) low-volume (≤100 tests daily), low-quality laboratories performing simple tests or (2) high-volume (>100 tests daily), high-quality laboratories. Each of these two groups did 45% of the daily testing volume (90% combined).--NEW SECTION--Clinical laboratory density in Kampala (1/1,781 persons) is high, approaching that in the United States (1/1,347 persons).

Real-time global surveillance, global disease mapping and global risk management characterize what have been termed 'global public health'. It has generated many programmes and policies, notably through the work of the World Health Organization. This globalized form of public health raises, however, some important issues left unchallenged, including its effectiveness, objectivity and legitimacy. The general objective of this article is to underline the impacts of WHO disease surveillance on the practice and theorization of global public health. By using the surveillance structure established by the World Health Organization and reinforced by the 2005 International Health Regulations as a case study, we argue that the policing of 'circulating risks' emerged as a dramatic paradox for global public health policy. This situation severely affects the rationale of health interventions as well as the lives of millions around the world, while travestying the meaning of health, disease and risks. To do so, we use health surveillance data collected by the WHO Disease Outbreak News System in order to map the impacts of global health surveillance on health policy rationale and theory.",eng,"Health (London, England : 1997)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampC genes in species of Citrobacter, Enterobacter or Escherichia genera. In this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampC beta-lactamase genes. Fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 Enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 Escherichia coli, 4 Citrobacter braakii, 9 Citrobacter freundii, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Proteus vulgaris, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Serratia sp. and 1 Cronobacter sp. A high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57%), observing the AmpC phenotype in 22 isolates (31%) and the ESBL phenotype in 3 isolates. AmpC molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla CMY and bla ACT genes from Citrobacter and Enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. The prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampC genes obtained in this study was 2%. The unique plasmid-mediated bla AmpC identified in this study was the bla CMY-2 gene, detected in an E. coli isolate ascribed to the sequence type ST405 which belonged to phylogenetic group D. The hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the ISEcp1-bla CMY-2-blc structure was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable IncK plasmid. This study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in Enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota.

The main mode of transmission is through contact with bodily fluids and skin of those infected or who have died. This review was undertaken to consider the evidence for transmission by contact with bodily fluids occurring through sexual activity.--NEW SECTION--No cases in the previous 20 outbreaks or the current outbreak in West Africa have been shown to be sexually transmitted, although other types of viral haemorrhagic fever have had sexual transmission implicated. Ebola virus is found in sites and fluids associated with sexual activity but this occurs at different stages of the disease. Persistence in the convalescent period occurs in rectum, vagina and semen, with persistence in semen being longest of up to at least 101 days. Recommendations based on this data are that those recovering from Ebola virus disease should abstain from all sexual intercourse, or if this is not possible, use condoms, for 3 months after the onset of symptoms.--NEW SECTION--There is theoretical plausibility for sexual transmission of Ebola virus but there has been no evidence of this occurring. Further research is needed to consider if sexual activity contributes to the epidemic in order to inform individuals with regard to avoiding acquisition or transmission by those recovering from Ebola virus disease.",eng,Current opinion in infectious diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Participants were randomly assigned to IUD insertion at the time of cesarean delivery or 6weeks afterward. The primary outcome was IUD utilization at 6months after delivery.--NEW SECTION--Among 68 women who underwent randomization, an IUD was inserted in 100% (34/34) of the women in the immediate insertion group and in 53% (18/34) in the delayed group. IUD use at 6 months was higher in the immediate insertion group (93% vs. 50% after delayed insertion; p<.0001). Infection and expulsion were rare and did not differ between groups. When we pooled both groups and looked at IUD users compared to nonusers, 91% (39/43) of IUD users were satisfied or very satisfied with their contraceptive method compared to 44% (11/25) of nonusers (p<.0001). Women who chose not to be in the study or had the IUD removed often did so because of perceived husband or community disapproval.--NEW SECTION--The 6-month utilization of an IUD after immediate insertion was significantly higher than after delayed insertion without increased complications. Contraceptive satisfaction was significantly higher among IUD users than nonusers. Community and husband attitudes influence IUD utilization and continuation in Kampala, Uganda.--NEW SECTION--This work is important because it shows the safety and efficacy of providing IUDs during cesarean section in a setting where access to any healthcare, including contraception, can be extremely limited outside of childbearing and the consequences of an unintended, closely spaced pregnancy after a cesarean section can be life threatening.",eng,Contraception,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The interaction between these phenomena is not well understood. This review aims to clarify the relationship between humanitarian emergencies and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.--NEW SECTION--With assistance from a research librarian, electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Global Health) were searched in January 2014. Findings were supplemented by reviewing citations of included trials. Observational studies reporting the effect of natural disasters and conflict events on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adults since 1997 were included. Studies without a comparison group were not included. Double-data extraction was utilized to abstract information on acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Review Manager 5.0 (Version 5.2, The Nordic Cochrane Centre; Copenhagen Denmark,) was used to create figures for qualitative synthesis.--NEW SECTION--The search retrieved 1,697 unique records; 24 studies were included (17 studies of natural disasters and seven studies of conflict). These studies involved 14,583 cardiac events. All studies utilized retrospective designs: four were population-based, 15 were single-center, and five were multicenter studies. Twenty-three studies utilized historical controls in the primary analysis, and one utilized primarily geographical controls.--NEW SECTION--Conflicts are associated with an increase in long-term morbidity from ACS; the short-term effects of conflict vary by study. Natural disasters exhibit heterogeneous effects, including increased occurrence of ACS, ADHF, and SCD.--NEW SECTION--In certain settings, humanitarian emergencies are associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality that may persist for years following the event.

The fifth percentile of age-, sex-, and body mass index-stratified reference values were used as cut-off. Quality of life was determined with the European Organization of Research and Treatment in Cancer questionnaire, reflecting both several function scales and symptom severity. Muscle strength was assessed by hand grip strength, knee extension strength, and peak expiratory flow.--NEW SECTION--433 cancer patients, aged 60-95 years, were recruited. Patients with low PhA (n = 197) exhibited decreased muscle strength compared with patients with normal PhA (hand grip strength: 22 ± 8.6 vs 28.9 ± 8.9 kg, knee extension strength: 20.8 ± 11.8 vs 28.1 ± 14.9 kg, and peak expiratory flow: 301.1 ± 118 vs 401.7 ± 142.6 L/min, P < .001). Physical function, global health status, and role function from the European Organization of Research and Treatment in Cancer questionnaire were reduced, and most symptoms (fatigue, anorexia, pain, and dyspnea) increased in patients with low PhA (P < .001).

Conventional treatments fail either because of poor patient compliance to the drug regimen or due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The aim of this review is to give an update on the information available on tuberculosis, its pathogenesis and current antitubercular chemotherapies. Direct lung delivery of anti-TB drugs using pulmonary delivery systems is then reviewed since it appears as an interesting strategy to improve first and second line drugs. A particular focus is place on research performed on inhalable dry powder formulations of antitubercular drugs to target alveolar macrophages where the bacteria develop. Numerous studies show that anti-TB drugs can be incorporated into liposomes, microparticles or nanoparticles which can be delivered as dry powders to the deep lungs for instantaneous, targeted and/or controlled release. Treatments of infected animals show a significant reduction of the number of viable bacteria as well as a decrease in tissue damage.

Imperfect understanding of the genuine needs of local surgeons limit CME initiatives. Previous paper-based needs assessment efforts have been unsuccessful because of low response rates. We explored using an electronic audience response system (ARS) during a Haitian CME conference to improve the response rates and better assess needs.--NEW SECTION--Data were prospectively collected using an ARS from 78 conference participants (57 Haitian and 21 foreign) about current and desired knowledge of 7 topic and 8 skill areas using a 5-point Likert scale presented in English and in French. The response rates using ARS vs a similar paper survey were compared using a 2-sample test of proportions. The current and desired knowledge levels were compared using paired t tests. Analysis of variance and post hoc unpaired t tests were used to compare between demographic groups.--NEW SECTION--The response rates were significantly greater for ARS vs a paper survey (87.7 vs 63.2%, p = 0.002). The 4 areas of least self-confidence for Haitians were pelvic and articular injury, joint dislocation, and osteomyelitis. The 4 skills of least self-confidence for Haitians were arthroscopy, open reduction and internal fixation-plate, external fixation, and fasciotomy. Haitians desired improvements in knowledge and management of articular, diaphyseal, and pelvic injury, joint dislocation, and osteomyelitis to a greater extent than foreigners (p < 0.05). Participants who previously attended the conference on open fractures felt more knowledgeable about open fractures as a topic (p < 0.05), but not in its management.--NEW SECTION--We are the first to show that an ARS improves response rates to allow for better characterization of surgeon needs in the developing world.

The adipose-derived hormone leptin acts via a specific receptor in the brain to regulate energy balance and body weight, although this protein can also elicit a myriad of actions in peripheral tissues. Obese individuals, rather than be leptin deficient, have in most cases, high levels of circulating leptin. The failure of these high levels to control body weight suggests the presence of a resistance process to the hormone that could be partly responsible of disturbances on body weight regulation. Furthermore, leptin resistance can impair physiological peripheral functions of leptin such as lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and nutrient intestinal utilization. The present document summarizes those findings regarding leptin resistance development and the role of this hormone in the development and maintenance of an obese state. Thus, we focused on the effect of the impaired leptin action on adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle and intestinal function and the accompanying relationships with diet-induced obesity. The involvement of some inflammatory mediators implicated in the development of obesity and their roles in leptin resistance development are also discussed.",eng,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In this project, we determined the antibacterial activity of a Ru(II) complex X-03 against S. pneumoniae in vitro, by comparing its toxicity to host cells A549 and HBE. We performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)-based proteomic analysis to characterize the protein alterations in S. pneumoniae after treatment with X-03. In total, 50 proteins exhibiting significant differential expressions were identified. RT-PCR was used to confirm the expression differences for selected proteins. Bioinformatics analysis on the proteomic alterations suggested that Ru(II) complex X-03 may obstruct bacterial fatty acid synthesis and oxidation-reduction process to suppress the growth of S. pneumoniae. Metal-uptake experiments revealed that iron-acquisition pathway in the bacterium may be interfered by X-03. These results provide useful clues for further investigations on the mechanism of the antibacterial action of metal compounds.--NEW SECTION--The appearance of bacterial strains with broad antibiotic resistance is becoming an alarming global health concern. The development of novel efficient antibacterial compound is urgently needed. In the present study, we found that Ru(II) complex X-03 has a significant antibacterial activity and applied proteomic technology combined with bioinformatics analysis to investigate its antimicrobial mechanism in S. pneumoniae. Many proteins were found to be dysregulated, implicating that X-03 may affect various molecular pathways leading to the inhibition of bacterial growth. Metal-uptake experiments demonstrated that X-03 treatment reduced the iron content in the bacterium, suggesting the interference with iron acquisition systems by the complex. This disturbance in iron acquisition may directly or indirectly induce the proteomic response that involved many pathways. In addition, X-03 could selectively suppress Gram-positive bacteria but execute less cytotoxicity to Gram-negative bacteria, with almost no effect on human cells, implicating its potential to be developed as a specific antimicrobial agent.

Internal validity was assessed in duplicate using the Risk of Bias tool. The strength of evidence was assessed in duplicate using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. Our primary outcome was mortality. Safety outcomes included hemorrhage, transfusion, and thrombocytopenia.--NEW SECTION--We included nine trials enrolling 2,637 patients. Eight trials were of unclear risk of bias and one was classified as having low risk of bias. In trials comparing heparin to placebo or usual care, the risk ratio for death associated with heparin was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.77-1.00; I2 = 0%; 2,477 patients; six trials; moderate strength of evidence). In trials comparing heparin to other anticoagulants, the risk ratio for death was 1.30 (95% CI, 0.78-2.18; I2 = 0%; 160 patients; three trials; low strength of evidence). In trials comparing heparin to placebo or usual care, major hemorrhage was not statistically significantly increased (risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.53-1.17; I2 = 0%; 2,392 patients; three trials). In one small trial of heparin compared with other anticoagulants, the risk of major hemorrhage was significantly increased (2.14; 95% CI, 1.07-4.30; 48 patients). Important secondary and safety outcomes, including minor bleeding, were sparsely reported.--NEW SECTION--Heparin in patients with sepsis, septic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with infection may be associated with decreased mortality; however, the overall impact remains uncertain.

Fixed-effect regression models assessed the effect of changes in each MPOWER measure on changes in current tobacco smoking between 2006 and 2009. All analyses were stratified by sex.--NEW SECTION--Overall, countries with higher MPOWER composite scores experienced greater decreases in current tobacco smoking between the years 2006 and 2009. Regression analyses revealed that the M and R measures showed a negative association with current tobacco smoking over time. Current tobacco smoking decreased (1.07 percentage points for males, 1.04 percentage points for females) with each increase in score value for monitoring tobacco use (M). Also, current tobacco smoking decreased (0.95 percentage points for males, 0.41 percentage points for females) with each increase in score value for raising taxes on tobacco (R). The effect of the MPOWER measures on current tobacco smoking varied by country income status (P measure in the female analysis; p<0.05) and/or by WHO region (M, P and O measures in the male analysis; p<0.05).--NEW SECTION--Higher levels of MPOWER combined, as well as continued and frequent monitoring of tobacco use (M) and increasing taxation (R), were associated with a decrease in current tobacco smoking over time.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Whole-genome sequencing of MRSA has been used to define phylogeny and transmission in well-resourced healthcare settings, yet the greatest burden of nosocomial infection occurs in resource-restricted settings where barriers to transmission are lower. Here, we study the flux and genetic diversity of MRSA on ward and individual patient levels in a hospital where transmission was common. We repeatedly screened all patients on two intensive care units for MRSA carriage over a 3-mo period. All MRSA belonged to multilocus sequence type 239 (ST 239). We defined the population structure and charted the spread of MRSA by sequencing 79 isolates from 46 patients and five members of staff, including the first MRSA-positive screen isolates and up to two repeat isolates where available. Phylogenetic analysis identified a flux of distinct ST 239 clades over time in each intensive care unit. In total, five main clades were identified, which varied in the carriage of plasmids encoding antiseptic and antimicrobial resistance determinants. Sequence data confirmed intra- and interwards transmission events and identified individual patients who were colonized by more than one clade. One patient on each unit was the source of numerous transmission events, and deep sampling of one of these cases demonstrated colonization with a ""cloud"" of related MRSA variants. The application of whole-genome sequencing and analysis provides novel insights into the transmission of MRSA in under-resourced healthcare settings and has relevance to wider global health.",eng,Genome research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We administered the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health-10 assessing General Self-Rated Health (GSRH), Global Physical and Mental Health; Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) assessing symptom burden; and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). We calculated population attributable fractions (PAF) of symptoms on poorly perceived health.--NEW SECTION--Participation rate was 90 %, but 51 % of observations were analyzable. Mean age was 57 years; 53 % were non-Hispanic black; and 20 % completed the survey in Spanish. All but 2 % reported at least one symptom most commonly lack of energy (87 %) and pain (83 %). The MSAS was well correlated with PHQ-2 (r = 0.65) and Global Physical Health (r = -0.65), but less with GSRH (r = -0.49). All negative health perception measures were largely attributable to lack of energy and pain, while depression-range PHQ-2 was attributable also to less prevalent symptoms including decreased appetite and sexual disinterest.--NEW SECTION--Symptom burden was less correlated with GSRH than with other measures of poor health perception. Fatigue and pain contributed the highest PAF to all measures of perceived poor health. Success with collecting PROMs in a resource-limited clinical setting demonstrates that the implementation of ACASI technology is feasible.",eng,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the type of surgery (partial vs. total nephrectomy) and the postoperative outcome on the QoL of patients with renal cancer.--NEW SECTION--A total of 205 patients underwent partial or total nephrectomy at the Department of Urology, Roskilde Hospital, between February 2008 and June 2013 and survived until the time of the survey. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was sent to this cohort in January 2014.--NEW SECTION--The response rate was 74.1 % for complete answers. The overall global health status (QoL) was low (69.12 %) for all patient groups, regardless of the operation technique and the underlying medical status. Total nephrectomy was a negative predictor of QoL, physical functioning, role functioning, and fatigue. Patients who experienced recurrence reported significant deterioration in 11 of the 15 EORTC QLQ-C30 domains. Additionally, thinking about cancer only during the follow-up visit was associated with a significant decrease in emotional functioning and role functioning compared with never thinking about one's cancer.--NEW SECTION--Total nephrectomy was a negative predictor of overall global health status.

Campylobacter concisus is an emergent pathogen that plays a role in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease. Despite ongoing research on Campylobacter virulence mechanisms, little is known regarding the immunological profile of the host response to Campylobacter infection. In this study, we describe a comprehensive global profile of innate immune responses to C. concisus infection in differentiated THP-1 macrophages infected with an adherent and invasive strain of C. concisus. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), quantitative PCR (qPCR), mass spectrometry, and confocal microscopy, we observed differential expression of pattern recognition receptors and robust upregulation of DNA- and RNA-sensing molecules. In particular, we observed IFI16 inflammasome assembly in C. concisus-infected macrophages. Global profiling of the transcriptome revealed the significant regulation of a total of 8,343 transcripts upon infection with C. concisus, which included the activation of key inflammatory pathways involving CREB1, NF-κB, STAT, and interferon regulatory factor signaling. Thirteen microRNAs and 333 noncoding RNAs were significantly regulated upon infection, including MIR221, which has been associated with colorectal carcinogenesis. This study represents a major advance in our understanding of host recognition and innate immune responses to infection by C. concisus.",eng,Infection and immunity,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Many epidemiologic studies showed that an antioxidant supplementation decreases the state of oxidative stress. In the present work, a HFD-induced rat obesity and oxidative stress were used to investigate the link between fat deposition and serum-oxidative stress markers. We also studied the effect of a chronic administration of 3-keto-1,5-bisphosphonates 1 (a & b) (40 μg/kg/8 weeks/i.p.). Exposure of rats to HFD during 16 weeks induced fat deposition, weight gain and metabolic disruption characterized by an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride and glycemia levels, and a decrease in ionizable calcium and free iron concentrations. HFD also induced serum-oxidative stress status vocalized by an increase in ROS (H2 O2 ), MDA and PC levels, with a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity (CAT, GPx, SOD). Importantly, 3-keto-1,5-bisphosphonates corrected all the deleterious effects of HFD treatment in vivo, but it failed to inhibit lipases in vitro and in vivo. These studies suggest that 3-keto-1,5-bisphosphonates 1 could be considered as safe antioxidant agents that should also find other potential biological applications.",eng,Chemical biology & drug design,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Knowledge of local disease transmission patterns in endemic countries is critical to these elimination efforts. To investigate fine-scale patterns of malaria transmission, we have compared repertoires of rapidly evolving var genes in a highly endemic area. A total of 3680 high-quality DBLα-sequences were obtained from 68 P. falciparum isolates from ten villages spread over two distinct catchment areas on the north coast of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Modelling of the extent of var gene diversity in the two parasite populations predicts more than twice as many var gene alleles circulating within each catchment (Mugil = 906; Wosera = 1094) than previously recognized in PNG (Amele = 369). In addition, there were limited levels of var gene sharing between populations, consistent with local parasite population structure. Phylogeographic analyses demonstrate that while neutrally evolving microsatellite markers identified population structure only at the catchment level, var gene repertoires reveal further fine-scale geospatial clustering of parasite isolates. The clustering of parasite isolates by village in Mugil, but not in Wosera was consistent with the physical and cultural isolation of the human populations in the two catchments. The study highlights the microheterogeneity of P. falciparum transmission in highly endemic areas and demonstrates the potential of var genes as markers of local patterns of parasite population structure.",eng,Molecular ecology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

As these nations have integrated into the world economy through bilateral trade and diplomacy, they have also become increasingly exposed to international pressures and norms and focused on more effective, equitable health care systems. There are several lessons learned from the case studies of Brazil, Ghana, India, China, Vietnam, and Thailand in this special issue on the global and domestic politics of health policy in emerging nations. For the countries examined, although sensitive to international preferences, domestic governments preferred to implement policy on their own and at their own pace. During the policy-making and implementation process, international and domestic actors played different roles in health policy making vis-à-vis other reform actors -- at times the state played an intermediary role. In several countries, civil society also played a central role in designing and implementing policy at all levels of government. International institutions also have a number of mechanisms and strategies in their tool box to influence a country's domestic health governance, and they use them, particularly in the context of an uncertain state or internal discordance within the state.",eng,"Journal of health politics, policy and law",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We discuss the critical importance of timing for policy intervention and the role of health policy in shaping the broader social terrain. The interventions of external actors such as the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund were instrumental in improving both policies and programs at a critical juncture, when the national responses to the epidemic had been ineffective. At the same time, those global interventions met resistance and led to unintended consequences, both welcome and unwelcome. Furthermore, the looming specter of donor withdrawal and the very gradually emerging national ownership raise many questions about capacity for scale-up and sustainability of the significant achievements to date. Further monitoring and in-depth analysis of the Vietnamese responses to the HIV epidemic in the next few years or so, we contend, have the potential to provide unique insights into the challenges faced by developing countries caught in the complex webs of health politics and policies at both the global and the national levels.",eng,"Journal of health politics, policy and law",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Through process tracing and comparative case studies, the article looks at how international institutions contribute to policy change in China and seeks to explain different outcomes in the relationship between international institutions and China's health policies. It finds that despite the opaque and exclusive authoritarian structure in China, international institutions play a significant role in the country's domestic health governance. By investing their resources and capabilities selectively and strategically, international institutions can change the preferences of government policy makers, move latent public health issues to the government's agenda, and affect the timing of government action and the content of policy design. Furthermore, the study suggests that different outcomes in the relationship between China's health policies and global health governance can be explained through the seriousness of the externalities China faces.",eng,"Journal of health politics, policy and law",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most prevalent and detrimental complication of DM: doubling the risk of CVD events (including stroke) and accounting for up to 80% of DM-related deaths. Given the aforementioned, interventions targeted at reducing CVD risk among people with DM are integral to limiting DM-related morbidity and mortality in LMIC, a majority of which are located in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, SSA is contextually unique: socioeconomic obstacles, cultural barriers, under-diagnosis, uncoordinated care, and shortage of physicians currently limit the capacity of SSA countries to implement CVD prevention among people with DM in a timely and sustainable manner. This article proposes a theory-based framework for conceptualizing integrated protocol-driven risk factor patient self-management interventions that could be adopted or adapted in future studies among hospitalized stroke patients with DM encountered in SSA. These interventions include systematic health education at hospital discharge, use of post-discharge trained community lay navigators, implementation of nurse-led group clinics and administration of health technology (personalized phone text messaging and home tele-monitoring), all aimed at increasing patient self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation for sustained adherence to therapies proven to reduce CVD event risk.",eng,Journal of the neurological sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

To assess health-related quality of life (HRQL) of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) following esophagectomy, 62 consecutive patients with middle ESCC were randomly assigned into hand video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (HVATS) (n=33) and Ivor-Lewis surgery (ILS) (n=29) groups. Quality of life questionnaires (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-OES18, published by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, were used prior to treatment and at regular intervals until 6 months following surgery. The results of QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES18 demonstrated that i) patients with comorbidities and advanced tumor stage (III-IV) exhibited increased risk of poor HRQL, while their gender, age, body mass index and anastomosis location were not associated with HRQL at 6 months after surgery; ii) all the patients had worse functional, symptom and global scores within 6 months after surgery; iii) patients in the HVATS group had similar baseline functional and symptom scores to those of patients in the ILS group; however, their functional and global scores were higher and their symptom scores were lower compared to those of patients in the ILS group; iv) the HRQL of patients in the HVATS group returned to preoperative levels within a shorter time period compared to patients in the ILS group. There were significant differences in global health, physical functioning, fatigue and pain scales between the two groups. In QLQ-OES18, the dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux scales were improved in both the HVATS and ILS groups, but no significant differences were observed between the two groups. In addition, the overall survival rate was similar in the two groups. Taken together, our findings indicated that HVATS is a safe procedure, associated with less disturbance to short-term HRQL compared to ILS.

Although the proportion of the burden arising from older people (≥60 years) is highest in high-income regions, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per head are 40% higher in low-income and middle-income regions, accounted for by the increased burden per head of population arising from cardiovascular diseases, and sensory, respiratory, and infectious disorders. The leading contributors to disease burden in older people are cardiovascular diseases (30·3% of the total burden in people aged 60 years and older), malignant neoplasms (15·1%), chronic respiratory diseases (9·5%), musculoskeletal diseases (7·5%), and neurological and mental disorders (6·6%). A substantial and increased proportion of morbidity and mortality due to chronic disease occurs in older people. Primary prevention in adults aged younger than 60 years will improve health in successive cohorts of older people, but much of the potential to reduce disease burden will come from more effective primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention targeting older people. Obstacles include misplaced global health priorities, ageism, the poor preparedness of health systems to deliver age-appropriate care for chronic diseases, and the complexity of integrating care for complex multimorbidities. Although population ageing is driving the worldwide epidemic of chronic diseases, substantial untapped potential exists to modify the relation between chronological age and health. This objective is especially important for the most age-dependent disorders (ie, dementia, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and vision impairment), for which the burden of disease arises more from disability than from mortality, and for which long-term care costs outweigh health expenditure. The societal cost of these disorders is enormous.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We report 5 cases of travel-related leptospirosis who presented at our clinic between January 2008 and December 2013. Patients were included in the study if they presented with a clinical profile that was compatible with the disease within 21 days of their return from traveling, which were laboratory-diagnosed as leptospirosis by blood culture, rise in antibody titers in paired sera using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), and/or DNA detection using flaB-nested PCR. Five leptospirosis cases were evaluated, all of which contracted the disease after exposure to fresh water in Southeast Asian countries. All of the cases had fevers, headaches, conjunctival injections, and relative bradycardia. The pertinent laboratory findings included elevated C-reactive protein levels, elevated creatinine levels, and sterile pyuria. All 5 cases had serum MAT titers that increased by ≥ 4 times in the interval between specimens taken during the acute phase and those taken during the convalescence phase, and leptospiral DNA was detected in plasma and/or urine specimens in 4 cases. Leptospira interrogans was isolated from one patient's blood sample. Patients were treated with penicillin G, minocycline, or doxycycline. One case was cured without antibiotics. A diagnosis of leptospirosis should be considered for febrile travelers who return from Southeast Asian countries to Japan after being exposed to freshwater while traveling.",eng,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,Case Reports,2025-04-23,2015

Cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer are the most common complications of HCV. Association between HCV and B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL) has been shown in epidemiological studies in the last 20 years. High prevalence of HCV infection among patients with NHL has been reported in the early 1990s by Ferri in Italy and this association has been confirmed in later studies. Geographically, HCV related NHL is highly variable and chronic rather than cleared HCV infection is required for lymphomagenesis. Although anti-HCV antibody test is the most commonly used technique in epidemiological studies, HCV-RNA is more useful test to detect the association between HCV and NHL. The optimal management of HCV related NHL is not clear. However, anti-viral treatment may be sufficient for cases with low grade and/or asymptomatic lymphomas, while immuno-chemotherapy is necessary, in spite of probable hepatic toxicity, in cases with high grade lymphomas.",eng,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Chronic hepatitis may be considered as silent and neglected killer, fuelled by many years of global inertia from stakeholders and policy makers alike. However, the global battle against viral hepatitis is facing a new era owing to the advent of highly effective drugs, innovative tools for screening and clinical follow-up, and recent signs that governments, advocacy groups and global health organizations are mobilizing to advocate universal access-to-treatment.

Here we explore the major roadblocks that prevent the use of cooling in LMIC, including differences in population comorbidities, suboptimal intensive care, and the lack of affordable servo-controlled cooling devices. The emerging data from LMIC suggest that the incidence of coexisting perinatal infections in NE is no different to that in high-income countries, and that cooling can be effectively provided without tertiary intensive care and ventilatory support; however, the data on safety and efficacy of cooling are limited. Without adequately powered clinical trials, the creeping and uncertain introduction of cooling therapy in LMIC will be plagued by residual safety concerns, and any therapeutic benefit will be even more difficult to translate into widespread clinical use.",eng,Seminars in fetal & neonatal medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

To address this shortage, a 5-year surgical residency program was established at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in July 2009. As the residency enters its fourth year, we hypothesized that the initiation of a general surgical residency program would result in an increase in the overall case volume and complexity at KCH.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a retrospective analysis of operated cases at KCH during the 3 years before and the third year after the implementation of the KCH surgical residency program, from July 2006 to July 2009 and the calendar year 2012, respectively.--NEW SECTION--During the 3 years before the initiation of the surgical residency, an average of 2317 operations were performed per year, whereas in 2012, 2773 operations were performed, representing a 20% increase. Before residency, an average of 1191 major operations per year were performed, and in 2012, 1501 major operations were performed, representing a 26% increase.--NEW SECTION--Our study demonstrates that operative case volume and complexity increase following the initiation of a surgical residency program in a sub-Saharan tertiary hospital.

In Uganda, intestinal schistosomiasis is endemic in 73 out of 112 districts and about 55% of the population of 36 million individuals are at risk. There is scanty information on the status and burden of schistosomiasis in preschool children less than six years of age in Uganda. This study aimed to assess the status of Schistosoma mansoni infections in children aged 1-5 years in Uganda. S. mansoni prevalence and intensity of infection were examined in 3058 children from 5 districts along Lake Victoria shoreline, eastern Uganda. For each child one stool sample was collected on three consecutive days. The Kato-Katz technique was used to prepare stool smears on slides for microscopic examination. Short interviews with a standardized pre-tested questionnaire prepared in the local language (Lusoga) were administered to each caregiver to identify risk factors associated with S. mansoni infection. An overall S. mansoni prevalence of 39.3% (95% CI: 38.0-41.1%) was estimated out of the 3058 stool samples examined. The geometric mean intensity of S. mansoni among the infected children was 273 (95% CI: 241-305) eggs per gram of faeces. Both prevalence and intensity of infection increased linearly with age (P<0.0001) and were highest in the age group 49-60 months. Majority (61%) of the children, especially in the age group 12-24 months (84.2%; 95% CI: 75.6-90.1%), were lightly infected. Short interviews with caregivers revealed that preschool children, 1-5 years old, get exposed to S. mansoni infested waters through bathing, playing or swimming. It is important that the Uganda national control programme for schistosomiasis takes preschool children into consideration and that health education on transmission of schistosomiasis is delivered to the endemic communities regularly.",eng,Acta tropica,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Despite its long-recognized role in diabetes management, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) only received WHO endorsement as a T2DM diagnostic tool in 2011. Although conventional plasma-specific tests have long been utilized to diagnose T2DM, the public should be informed that plasma-specific tests are not markedly better than HbA1c tests, particularly in terms of variability and convenience for diagnosing diabetes. In the midst of the debates associated with establishing HbA1c as the preeminent diabetes diagnostic tool, unceasing efforts to standardize HbA1c tests have played an integral part in achieving more efficient communication from laboratory to clinical practice and thus better diabetes care. This review discusses the current status of HbA1c tests in the diagnosis, prevention, treatment and management of T2DM across the globe, focusing on increasing the recognition of glycated hemoglobin variants with effective utilization of different HbA1c methods, updating the current status of HbA1c standardization programs, tapping into the potential of POC analyzers to establish a cost-effective HbA1c test for diabetes care, and inspiring the advancement of HbA1c biosensors for future clinical usage.",eng,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

They are often treated by parenteral administrations of antimicrobials. Unfortunately, systemic therapies of high-dose antimicrobials can lead to severe adverse effects and this calls for a need to develop inhaled formulations that enable targeted drug delivery to the airways with minimal systemic drug exposure. Recent technological advances facilitate the development of inhaled anti-microbial therapies. The newer mesh nebulisers have achieved minimal drug residue, higher aerosolisation efficiencies and rapid administration compared to traditional jet nebulisers. Novel particle engineering and intelligent device design also make dry powder inhalers appealing for the delivery of high-dose antibiotics. In view of the fact that no new antibiotic entities against multi-drug resistant bacteria have come close to commercialisation, advanced formulation strategies are in high demand for combating respiratory 'super bugs'.",eng,Advanced drug delivery reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

All articles from MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (inception to July 2014), reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature were searched. Two reviewers independently identified all manuscripts utilizing the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.--NEW SECTION--Humans, prospective studies (five or more patients), documented ICP response to indomethacin, and English.--NEW SECTION--non-English, retrospective studies, no documentation of ICP response to indomethacin, and animal studies. A two-tier filter of references was conducted. First, we screened manuscripts by title and abstract. Second, those references passing the first filter were pulled, and the full manuscript was checked to see if it matched the criteria for inclusion. Two reviewers independently extracted data including population characteristics and treatment characteristics. The strength of evidence was adjudicated using both the Oxford and GRADE methodology. Our search strategy produced a total of 208 citations. Twelve original articles, 10 manuscripts, and 2 meeting proceeding, were considered for the review with all utilizing indomethacin, while documenting ICP in neurological patients. All studies were prospective. Across all studies, there were a total of 177 patients studied, with 152 receiving indomethacin and 25 serving as controls in a variety of heterogeneous studies. All but one study documented a decrease in ICP with indomethacin administration, with both bolus and continuous infusions. No significant complications were described. There currently exists Oxford level 2b, GRADE C evidence to support that indomethacin reduces ICP in the severe TBI population. Similar conclusions in other populations cannot be made at this time. Comments on its impact, on patient outcome, and side effects cannot be made given the available data.

This excessive health disparity is primarily due to the higher risk of communicable diseases in low-income countries. Social determinants of health are mainly responsible for the health disparities observed within and between countries.--NEW SECTION--Future health care development and global research priorities will not be the same for all countries because the pattern of health transitions in the developing countries is not the same as the developed countries.

There have been numerable studies undertaking research on different aspects of ischaemic stroke employing various epidemiological, clinical and molecular parameters. Nevertheless ischaemic stroke being a complex disorder with different subtypes demands equal attention towards its subtypes too. Since there has been enough evidence that disposition to certain subtype is genetically determined and there is a distinct mechanism that influences its development, association studies should focus on subtypes simultaneously while studying specific genes. Data from such studies will thus provide better and intricate findings with regard to heterogenous ischaemic stroke.

These populations are at an increased risk of damage because exposure to pollutants during critical periods of development can cause many impairments. Children's exposure to mixtures of metals could be responsible for the rising numbers of neurological disorders surfacing in Iraqi children. Titanium (Ti) and magnesium (Mg) are heavily used in war industries. Exposure to Ti and Mg has been linked to the dust in occupation soldiers' lungs. Hair samples of children in Hawija, Iraq (n = 13) contained significantly higher levels of Ti compared to Iranian children (n = 13) living near the Iraqi border (2080 ± 940 vs 707 ± 421 μg/kg, p < 0.0001). Magnesium was 1.7 times higher in Hawija children compared to Iranian children (115,763 ± 118,155 vs 67,650 ± 46,729 μg/kg). In samples from Hawija, Ti was 1.3 times higher in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (2198 ± 1108 vs 1942 ± 779 μg/kg), and Mg was 1.9 times higher in children without neurodevelopmental disorders (155,618 ± 140,791 vs 81,602 ± 91,940 μg/kg). Lead, arsenic, and cadmium in Hawija children with neurodevelopmental disorders (n = 6) were 2.5, 2.2, and 1.37 times higher compared to non-disabled children (n = 7). To get a clear understanding of the current status of neurodevelopmental disorders in Iraqi children and to determine the magnitude of this suspected global health issue, registries should be set up to compile and aggregate data from hospitals, clinics, and health centers across the country.

In low- and middle-income countries, in particular, great strives have been made in the control of communicable diseases, including helminth infections. Nevertheless, the most marginalised communities still suffer from infectious diseases that are intimately connected with poverty and lack of access to essential commodities and services, such as clean water, improved sanitation and sufficient food. A two-pronged approach is thus necessary: (i) intensifying control in remaining high-endemicity areas and pockets of high transmission; and (ii) moving from morbidity control to interruption of disease transmission in low-endemicity areas with the goal of local elimination. The latter will require new tools and strategies, going hand-in-hand with strong partnerships and new strategic alliances. In this special issue of Acta Tropica, 35 articles are featured that, together, provide an up-to-date overview of the latest progress made in research, control and elimination of helminth infections in East and Southeast Asia. The first 12 articles expound tools and approaches for improved detection, surveillance and monitoring of helminth infections. Control and elimination approaches for the most important helminth infections are revisited in the next 20 articles. The three remaining articles are cross-cutting pieces examining the interface of agriculture, environment and helminth infections and providing a rationale for integrated, multi-sectorial control approaches that are necessary for sustaining helminthiasis control and progressively moving towards elimination. An interesting aspect revealed through an in-depth analysis of the provenance of the 35 contributions is that the People's Republic of China emerges as a key player in global health, which is documented through its prominent role in research and control of helminth infection and networking throughout Asia. Policy implications are discussed and will hopefully shape the future agenda for the control and elimination of helminth infections the world over.",eng,Acta tropica,Editorial,2025-04-23,2015

Forty-five MVtopo images were acquired and analyzed with in-house image registration software.--NEW SECTION--The smallest jaw size (front and backup jaws of 0) provided the best image contrast and longitudinal resolution. Couch velocity did not affect the image quality or geometric accuracy. The MVtopo dose was less than the MVCT dose. The image registration uncertainty from the multi-institutional study was within 2.8 mm. In patient localization, the differences in calculated couch shift between the registration with MVtopo-kVtopo and MVCT-kVCT images in lateral, cranial-caudal, and vertical directions were 2.2 ± 1.7 mm, 2.6 ± 1.4 mm, and 2.7 ± 1.1 mm, respectively.

Children from families, having ≤2 siblings (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.958, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.163-3.296), upper class family (aOR=3.672; 95% CI: 1.154-11.690), and advantaged ethnic group (aOR=1.561; 95% CI: 1.00-2.437) and children who were of larger birth weight (>4.0kg) had a greater likelihood of being (aOR=2.557, 95% CI: 1.222-5.349) overweight/obese.--NEW SECTION--A quarter of children were found to be overweight/obese in private primary schools. Preventive interventions should focus on the advantaged ethnic groups, families with fewer siblings, and upper class families. A greater emphasis ought to be placed on formulation and implementation of policies aimed at addressing the newly emerging problems of childhood overweight/obesity in Nepal.

The aim of the present research was to examine the effect that new-media-based sexual-health interventions have on sexual-health behaviours in non-clinical populations and to determine the factors that moderate the effect of technology-based sexual-health interventions on sexual--health behaviours.--NEW SECTION--A systematic literature search of the following databases was conducted: MEDLINE, psycINFO, Global health, and EMBASE, using terms that captured three subject areas-'Sexual-health', 'New Technology' and 'Intervention'.--NEW SECTION--Randomised controlled trial, or a quasi-experiment; delivered exclusively via new-media; included sexual risk behaviour change as an outcome measure and delivered to non-clinical groups.--NEW SECTION--Twelve studies tested the effect of new-media interventions on condom use, whereas nine tested the effect on sexually transmitted disease testing. Results indicated that new-media interventions led to significant increases in both outcomes; however, these effects were not homogeneous. Moderation analyses revealed that interactivity of the intervention, target population and study design influenced the efficacy of interventions on both sexual-health outcomes, whereas intervention duration influenced sexually transmitted infection testing.--NEW SECTION--Interventions aiming to improve condom use are more successful when an interactive component is used. Further research needs to be conducted to reach specific at-risk populations.",eng,Sexually transmitted infections,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We explored the impact of pulmonary delivery of recombinant influenza A viruses (rIAVs) on the induction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis)-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses and the resultant protection against M. tuberculosis infection in C57BL/6 mice. Intranasal infection with rIAVs expressing a CD4(+) T-cell epitope from the Ag85B protein (PR8.p25) or CD8(+) T-cell epitope from the TB10.4 protein (PR8.TB10.4) generated strong T-cell responses to the M. tuberculosis-specific epitopes in the lung that persisted long after the rIAVs were cleared. Infection with PR8.p25 conferred protection against subsequent M. tuberculosis challenge in the lung, and this was associated with increased levels of poly-functional CD4(+) T cells at the time of challenge. By contrast, infection with PR8.TB10.4 did not induce protection despite the presence of IFN-γ-producing M. tuberculosis-specific CD8(+) T cells in the lung at the time of challenge and during infection. Therefore, the induction of pulmonary M. tuberculosis epitope-specific CD4(+), but not CD8(+) T cells, is essential for protection against acute M. tuberculosis infection in the lung.",eng,European journal of immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Information about age of onset, persistence and development of MHP in young people is necessary to implement effective prevention and intervention strategies. We describe the design and methods of the longitudinal BELLA study, which investigates developmental trajectories of MHP from childhood into adulthood, their determinants, and the utilisation of mental health services. First results on the developmental course of MHP in children and adolescents are reported over a 6-year period. The BELLA study is the mental health module of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey for children and adolescents (KiGGS). BELLA examines the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents aged 7-17 years (a representative subsample of KiGGS, n = 2,863 at baseline). Standardised screening measures served to identify MHP at baseline and at follow-ups (1, 2, and 6 years later). Among children and adolescents participating at all measurement points (n = 1,255), 10 % showed clinically significant MHP at baseline (n = 130). Over the 6-year period, 74.3 % showed no signs of MHP (n = 933), 15.5 % had remitted (n = 194), 2.9 % showed persistent (n = 36) and 7.3 % acute or recurrent MHP (n = 92).

Recent advances in genomic research and technologies have increased our understanding of human diseases, genes associated with these disorders, and the relevant mechanisms. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proliferated since the first studies were published several years ago and have become an important tool in helping researchers comprehend human variation and the role genetic variants play in disease. However, the need to expand the diversity of populations in GWAS has become increasingly apparent as new knowledge is gained about genetic variation. Inclusion of diverse populations in genomic studies is critical to a more complete understanding of human variation and elucidation of the underpinnings of complex diseases. In this review, we summarize the available data on GWAS in recent African ancestry populations within the western hemisphere (i.e. African Americans and peoples of the Caribbean) and continental African populations. Furthermore, we highlight ways in which genomic studies in populations of recent African ancestry have led to advances in the areas of malaria, HIV, prostate cancer, and other diseases. Finally, we discuss the advantages of conducting GWAS in recent African ancestry populations in the context of addressing existing and emerging global health conditions.",eng,Public health genomics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The development of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens has allowed the use of allogeneic transplantation in this population, but the optimal regimen remains undefined. We conducted a multicenter phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen combining fludarabine, intravenous busulfan, and rabbit antithymocyte globulins in patients older than 55 years of age transplanted from matched-related donor. In addition, health-related quality of life was prospectively measured. Seventy-five patients with a median age of 60 years (range 55-70) were analyzed. Grade III-IV acute and extensive chronic graft-versus-host diseases were found in 3% and 27% of patients, respectively. The day 100 and 1-year non-relapse mortality incidences were 1% and 9%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of relapse, progression-free survival and overall survival at two years were 36%, 51% and 67%, respectively, with a median follow up of 49 months. Global health-related quality of life, physical functioning, emotional functioning, and social functioning were not impaired compared to baseline for more than 75% of the patients (75%, 81.4%, 82.3%, and 75%, respectively). Thirty-four of the 46 (74%) progression-free patients at one year were living without persistent extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease.

Topics included neck dissection, parotidectomy, total laryngectomy, parapharyngeal space tumors excision, and pectoralis myocutaneous flaps. A pre- and postcourse self-evaluation survey was administered to measure course impact.--NEW SECTION--Eighteen otolaryngologists and trainees participated in the course, with 17 completing course surveys. The majority of participants (72%) were from Kenya. Prior to the start of the course, 41%, 71%, 23%, 12%, and 0% of participants indicated they could complete a neck dissection, parotidectomy, parapharyngeal space mass excision, total laryngectomy, and pectoralis myocutaneous flap, respectively.

The results were grouped based on the means of measurement (baseline vs time integrated) and analysis (univariable or multivariable).--NEW SECTION--Fifty-seven studies from 1232 hits were included. All published studies that assessed the relationship between any time-integrated DAI including joint count and radiographic progression reached a statistically significant association. Among the single instruments, only swollen joint count and ESR were associated with radiographic progression, while no significant association was found for tender joint count. Data with respect to CRP are conflicting. Data on patient's global health, pain assessment and evaluator's global assessment are limited and do not support a positive association with progression of joint damage.--NEW SECTION--Published data indicate that all DAIs that include swollen joints are related to radiographic progression while, of the individual components, only swollen joints and acute phase reactants are associated.

Vitamin D, as an environmental factor, is involved in many biological processes, like perception of chronic pain and response to infections. In recent years, evidence has emerged pointing to an involvement of vitamin D in the development of many autoimmune diseases, and a severe vitamin D deficiency has been especially demonstrated in patients affected with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). Low levels of vitamin D were found associated with antithyroid antibody presence, abnormal thyroid function, increased thyroid volume, increased TSH levels, and adverse pregnancy outcome in women with AITD. Vitamin D mediates its effect through binding to vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is harbored on many human immune cells, and in this way is able to modulate immune cells activity, triggering both innate and adaptive immune responses. As VDR gene polymorphisms were found to associate with AITD, the evidence links vitamin D deficiency to AITD either through gene polymorphism or by environmental factors (lack of dietary uptake and sun exposure). Vitamin D supplementation may be offered to AITD patients, but further research is needed to define whether it should be introduced in clinical practice.",eng,Immunologic research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25403350,10.1111/pim.12160,Not all parasites are protective.,"Successful endoparasites of mammals must outwit the sophisticated immune systems of their hosts that have evolved to detect and destroy/eradicate them. Many species of helminth parasite can directly or indirectly manipulate host immunity: helminth-derived molecules can suppress or skew activity of many immune cell phenotypes, and mobilization of regulatory cells in response to infection can inhibit immune cell activation. Moreover, many investigations, principally in laboratory-based rodent-helminth systems, demonstrate that infection with helminths (trematode, cestode or nematode) can ameliorate the severity of concomitant disease that model diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. Ongoing analyses in these model systems may uncover novel approaches to the management and cure of inflammatory diseases that are major global health issues. However, the potential of environmentally or experimentally (i.e. 'therapeutically') acquired infection with helminth parasites to exaggerate the severity immunopathologies in the host should not be overlooked. Here, examples of infection with helminth parasites exacerbating concomitant disease and commentary on possible adverse effects of helminth therapy are provided--the intent is not to undermine the development of helminth therapy, but to illustrate caveats that may need to be considered should helminth therapy be utilized as a treatment for inflammatory disease.",eng,Parasite immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25395144,10.1111/bioe.12120,Valuing Stillbirths.,"Estimates of the burden of disease assess the mortality and morbidity that affect a population by producing summary measures of health such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). These measures typically do not include stillbirths (fetal deaths occurring during the later stages of pregnancy or during labor) among the negative health outcomes they count. Priority-setting decisions that rely on these measures are therefore likely to place little value on preventing the more than three million stillbirths that occur annually worldwide. In contrast, neonatal deaths, which occur in comparable numbers, have a substantial impact on burden of disease estimates and are commonly seen as a pressing health concern. In this article we argue in favor of incorporating unintended fetal deaths that occur late in pregnancy into estimates of the burden of disease. Our argument is based on the similarity between late-term fetuses and newborn infants and the assumption that protecting newborns is important. We respond to four objections to counting stillbirths: (1) that fetuses are not yet part of the population and so their deaths should not be included in measures of population health; (2) that valuing the prevention of stillbirths will undermine women's reproductive rights; (3) that including stillbirths implies that miscarriages (fetal deaths early in pregnancy) should also be included; and (4) that birth itself is in fact ethically significant. We conclude that our proposal is ethically preferable to current practice and, if adopted, is likely to lead to improved decisions about health spending.",eng,Bioethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25392223,10.1128/JVI.02019-14,Cyclic avian mass mortality in the northeastern United States is associated with a novel orthomyxovirus.,"Since 1998, cyclic mortality events in common eiders (Somateria mollissima), numbering in the hundreds to thousands of dead birds, have been documented along the coast of Cape Cod, MA, USA. Although longitudinal disease investigations have uncovered potential contributing factors responsible for these outbreaks, detecting a primary etiological agent has proven enigmatic. Here, we identify a novel orthomyxovirus, tentatively named Wellfleet Bay virus (WFBV), as a potential causative agent of these outbreaks. Genomic analysis of WFBV revealed that it is most closely related to members of the Quaranjavirus genus within the family Orthomyxoviridae. Similar to other members of the genus, WFBV contains an alphabaculovirus gp64-like glycoprotein that was demonstrated to have fusion activity; this also tentatively suggests that ticks (and/or insects) may vector the virus in nature. However, in addition to the six RNA segments encoding the prototypical structural proteins identified in other quaranjaviruses, a previously unknown RNA segment (segment 7) encoding a novel protein designated VP7 was discovered in WFBV. Although WFBV shows low to moderate levels of sequence similarity to Quaranfil virus and Johnston Atoll virus, the original members of the Quaranjavirus genus, additional antigenic and genetic analyses demonstrated that it is closely related to the recently identified Cygnet River virus (CyRV) from South Australia, suggesting that WFBV and CyRV may be geographic variants of the same virus. Although the identification of WFBV in part may resolve the enigma of these mass mortality events, the details of the ecology and epidemiology of the virus remain to be determined.--NEW SECTION--The emergence or reemergence of viral pathogens resulting in large-scale outbreaks of disease in humans and/or animals is one of the most important challenges facing biomedicine. For example, understanding how orthomyxoviruses such as novel influenza A virus reassortants and/or mutants emerge to cause epidemic or pandemic disease is at the forefront of current global health concerns. Here, we describe the emergence of a novel orthomyxovirus, Wellfleet Bay virus (WFBV), which has been associated with cyclic large-scale bird die-offs in the northeastern United States. This initial characterization study provides a foundation for further research into the evolution, epidemiology, and ecology of newly emerging orthomyxoviruses, such as WFBV, and their potential impacts on animal and/or human health.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

SF-6D was estimated from QLQ-C30 scores via ordinary least squares, generalized linear models and median (least-absolute deviations) regression approaches, and with Bayesian additive regression kernels. Predictive ability was assessed with root mean square error, mean absolute error and proportions of predictions with absolute errors >0.05 and >0.1, whereas explanatory power with adjusted R (2) or equivalent fit measures. Two external samples (breast and colorectal cancer) were used to further test the models.--NEW SECTION--The QLQ-C30's global health item, the physical, emotional and social functioning scales, and the fatigue, pain and diarrhea symptom scales were significant predictors (p < 0.05 or better) in all models. Negligible deviations in models' performance were observed. All models overpredicted utilities for patients in worst health and underpredicted them for those in better health (p < 0.01 or better). Regarding external validation, performance was better in the colorectal cancer than in the breast cancer sample.--NEW SECTION--This study has provided evidence to support the use of ""global"" mapping models to predict SF-6D utilities from QLQ-C30 in patients with different cancers. Testing with diverse patient samples is required to confirm the generalizability (or not) of mapping models across cancer conditions.",eng,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015
25389183,10.1093/tropej/fmu063,Barriers to use of oral rehydration salts for child diarrhea in the private sector: evidence from India.,"Diarrhea is the second leading cause of child mortality in India. Most deaths are cheaply preventable with the use of oral rehydration salts (ORS), yet many health providers still fail to provide ORS to children seeking diarrheal care. In this study, we use survey data to assess whether children visiting private providers for diarrheal care were less likely to use ORS than those visiting public providers. Results suggest that children who visited private providers were 9.5 percentage points less likely to have used ORS than those who visited public providers (95% CI 5-14). We complimented these results with in-depth interviews of 21 public and 17 private doctors in Gujarat, India, assessing potential drivers of public-private disparities in ORS use. Interview results suggested that lack of direct medication dispensing in the private sector might be a key barrier to ORS use in the private sector.",eng,Journal of tropical pediatrics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We report on the performance, financial sustainability, and policy impact of a free-of-cost multispecialty surgical delivery program in Karachi, Pakistan built upon local private philanthropy.--NEW SECTION--We evaluated trends in surgical service delivery, expenditures, and philanthropic donations from Indus Hospital's first 5 years of operation (2007-2012), projected these over the hospital's current expansion phase, compared these to publicly accessible records of other philanthropic hospitals providing surgical care, and documented the government's evolving policies toward this model.--NEW SECTION--Between 2007 and 2012, Indus Hospital treated 40,012 in-patients free of cost, 33,606 (84 %) of them for surgical procedures. Surgical procedures increased fivefold to 9,478 during 2011-2012 from 1,838 during 2007-2008. Bed occupancy increased to 91 % from 65 % over the same period. External surgical missions accounted for less than 0.5 % of patients served. Ninety-eight percent (98 %) of all philanthropic donations--totaling USD 26.6 million over 2007-2012--were locally generated. Zakat (obligatory annual religious alms in the Islamic faith) constituted 34 % of all donations, followed by unrestricted funds (24 %) and donations-in-kind (24 %), buildings (12 %), grants (5 %), and return on investments (1 %). Overall, donations received between 2007 and 2012 increased sevenfold, with Zakat increasing 12-fold. During 2013-2014, the Government of Pakistan provided land lease and annual operational grants totaling USD 9 million.--NEW SECTION--Local philanthropy can sustain and grow the provision of free, high-quality surgical care in low-income settings, and encourage the development of hybrid government-philanthropic models of surgical care.",eng,World journal of surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

From the extracted crude prevalence rates, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis, and further estimated the overall awareness rate of hypertension in Nigeria, expressed as percentage of all hypertension cases. We applied a meta-regression epidemiological modelling, using United Nations population demographics for the years 2010 and 2030, to determine the prevalence and number of cases of hypertension in Nigeria for the 2 years.--NEW SECTION--Our search returned 2260 publications, 27 of which met our selection criteria. From the random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated an overall hypertension prevalence of 28.9% (25.1, 32.8), with a prevalence of 29.5% (24.8, 34.3) among men and 25.0% (20.2, 29.7) among women. We estimated a prevalence of 30.6% (24.5, 36.6) and 26.4% (19.4, 33.4) among urban and rural dwellers, respectively. The pooled awareness rate of hypertension was 17.4% (11.4, 23.3). The overall mean SBP was 128.6 (125.5, 130.8) mmHg, and the DBP was 80.6 (78.5, 82.7) mmHg. From our modelling, we estimated about 20.8 million cases of hypertension in Nigeria among people aged at least 20 years in 2010, with a prevalence of 28.0% (24.6, 31.9) in both sexes - 30.7% (24.9, 33.7) among men and 25.2% (22.7, 31.9) among women. By 2030, we projected an increase to 39.1 million cases of hypertension among people aged at least 20 years with a prevalence of 30.8% (24.5, 33.7) in both sexes - 32.6% (27.3, 38.2) among men and 29.0% (21.9-32.2) among women.--NEW SECTION--Our findings suggest the prevalence of hypertension is high in Nigeria, and the overall awareness of raised blood pressure among hypertension cases is low in the country. We hope this study will inform appropriate public health response towards reducing this burden.",eng,Journal of hypertension,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25378552,10.1136/medethics-2014-102072,A comparison of justice frameworks for international research.,"Justice frameworks have been developed for international research that provide guidance on the selection of research targets, ancillary care, research capacity strengthening, and post-trial benefits. Yet there has been limited comparison of the different frameworks. This paper examines the underlying aims and theoretical bases of three such frameworks--the fair benefits framework, the human development approach and research for health justice--and considers how their aims impact their guidance on the aforementioned four ethical issues. It shows that the frameworks' underlying objectives vary across two dimensions. First, whether they seek to prevent harmful or exploitative international research or to promote international research with health benefits for low and middle-income countries. Second, whether they address justice at the micro level or the macro level. The fair benefits framework focuses on reforming contractual elements in individual international research collaborations to ensure fairness, whereas the other two frameworks aim to connect international research with the reduction of global health inequities. The paper then highlights where there is overlap between the frameworks' requirements and where differences in the strength and content of the obligations they identify arise as a result of their varying objectives and theoretical bases. In doing so, it does not offer a critical comparison of the frameworks but rather seeks to add clarity to current debates on justice and international research by showing how they are positioned relative to one another.",eng,Journal of medical ethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

CNS injuries cause the elevation of many proteins, including innate immune proteins in biological fluids, such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These innate immune proteins can be considered as biomarkers to predict the severity of CNS injury in patients.--NEW SECTION--This invention describes a method for the diagnosis/prognosis, treatment or rehabilitation efforts, and monitoring of post-treatment responses after CNS injuries in a patient, based on the detection and quantification of the expression levels of protein components of inflammasomes in the CSF. This study evaluates the elevated levels of inflammasome proteins such as NLRP1 (NAcht leucine-rich-repeat protein 1), ASC and caspase-1 in biological samples as important biomarkers that can assess the extent of neuroinflammation and reflect the magnitude of inflammation-induced damage following CNS injury.--NEW SECTION--Although inflammasome proteins may be of great clinical significance in the near future, a more detailed analysis of inflammasome proteins needs to be taken into account for the prognosis and treatment of diverse CNS conditions. Moreover, the potential inflammasome biomarker candidates have to be validated in a large number of patients for an extended period post-injury to further support clinical relevance.",eng,Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Here, we evaluate the long-term efficacy of a respiratory and sublingual (SL) adenovirus-based vaccine in non-human primates in two phases. In the first, a single respiratory dose of 1.4×10(9) infectious virus particles (ivp)/kg of Ad-CAGoptZGP induced strong Ebola glycoprotein (GP) specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses and Ebola GP-specific antibodies in systemic and mucosal compartments and was partially (67%) protective from challenge 62 days after immunization. The same dose given by the SL route induced Ebola GP-specific CD8+ T cell responses similar to that of intramuscular (IM) injection, however, the Ebola GP-specific antibody response was low. All primates succumbed to infection. Three primates were then given the vaccine in a formulation that improved the immune response to Ebola in rodents. Three primates were immunized with 2.0×10(10) ivp/kg of vaccine by the SL route. Diverse populations of polyfunctional Ebola GP-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and significant anti-Ebola GP antibodies were present in samples collected 150 days after respiratory immunization. The formulated vaccine was fully protective against challenge 21 weeks after immunization. While diverse populations of Ebola GP-specific CD4+ T cells were produced after SL immunization, antibodies were not neutralizing and the vaccine was unprotective. To our knowledge, this is the first time that durable protection from a single dose respiratory adenovirus-based Ebola vaccine has been demonstrated in primates.",eng,Molecular pharmaceutics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In response, tobacco companies are frequently using international trade and investment agreements as tools to challenge domestic tobacco control measures. Several significant new trade and investment agreements that some fear may provide new legal avenues to the tobacco industry to challenge health measures are currently under negotiation, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (a 12 party agreement of Asia-Pacific regional countries) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (an agreement between the USA and the European Union). This commentary examines different options for treaty provisions that the parties could employ in these agreements to minimise legal risks relating to tobacco control measures.

Anchors for responsiveness were defined by patients' global assessment of disease impact according to changes in a visual analogue scale (VAS), a 7-point Likert scale and a 0-3 scale of five patient-reported symptoms. Mean change and s.d. in worsening and improving patients according to anchors were estimated using mixed models for repeated measures. Standardized response means (SRMs) were calculated in each group.--NEW SECTION--Patients [mean age 39.6 years (s.d. 10.5), mean Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-SLEDAI score 2.6 (s.d. 3.5)] answered a total of 515 questionnaires. For the VAS and Likert global anchors, worsening patients showed a significant decrease in all LupusQoL domains except for burden to others, body image and fatigue and all SF-36 domains with low to moderate responsiveness. Improving patients had a significant increase in all LupusQoL domains except for intimate relationship and all SF-36 domains except for physical functioning and global health with low to moderate responsiveness. Regarding similar domains in the SF-36 and LupusQoL, SRMs were higher in LupusQoL domains in improving patients, while SF-36 domains had larger SRMs in worsening patients.--NEW SECTION--Both the SF-36 and LupusQoL were responsive to changes in QoL in SLE patients over a 3 month interval.

Overall, we identify competition between two discourses on help-seeking practices. This competition is present most when people seek help with unspecific, vague, or diffuse illness complaints, voicing uncertainty as to what counts as signs of illness, characteristic of proactive discourses emanating from global, scientific biomedicine. Such indistinct help-seeking conflicts with the dominant discourse in the local clinical setting and is characterized by an overt focus on identification of the chief complaint.

The Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) survey was designed to measure the incidence and prevalence of surgically treatable conditions, including musculoskeletal conditions, in patients in low- and middle-income countries, and was administered in the West African nation of Sierra Leone in 2012.--NEW SECTION--We attempted to quantify the burden of potentially treatable musculoskeletal conditions in patients in Sierra Leone.--NEW SECTION--A cross-sectional two-stage cluster-based survey was performed in Sierra Leone using the SOSAS. Two individuals from each randomly selected household underwent a verbal head to toe examination. The musculoskeletal-related questions from the SOSAS survey in Sierra Leone were analyzed to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal problems in the study population. Prevalence is reported as the number of respondents with a musculoskeletal problem now and number of respondents with a musculoskeletal problem during the past year. Respondents had ""no need"" for care, they ""received care"", or they faced a barrier that prevented them from receiving care.--NEW SECTION--One thousand eight hundred seventy-five households were targeted, with 1843 undergoing the survey, which yielded 3645 individual respondents. Of the individual respondents, 462 (n=3645; 12.6% of total; 95% CI, 12%-13%) had a traumatic musculoskeletal problem during the past year, and 236 (n=3645; 6% of total; 95% CI, 5%-7%) respondents had a musculoskeletal problem of nontraumatic etiology.

25339636,10.1093/heapol/czu117,Capacity building for global health diplomacy: Thailand's experience of trade and health.,"A rapid expansion of trade liberalization in Thailand during the 1990s raised a critical question for policy transparency from various stakeholders. Particular attention was paid to a bilateral trade negotiation between Thailand and USA concerned with the impact of the 'Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Rights (TRIPS) plus' provisions on access to medicines. Other trade liberalization effects on health were also concerning health actors. In response, a number of interagency committees were established to engage with trade negotiations. In this respect, Thailand is often cited as a positive example of a country that has proactively sought, and achieved, trade and health policy coherence. This article investigates this relationship in more depth and suggests lessons for wider study and application of global health diplomacy (GHD). This study involved semi-structured interviews with 20 people involved in trade-related health negotiations, together with observation of 9 meetings concerning trade-related health issues. Capacity to engage with trade negotiations appears to have been developed by health actors through several stages; starting from the Individual (I) understanding of trade effects on health, through Nodes (N) that establish the mechanisms to enhance health interests, Networks (N) to advocate for health within these negotiations, and an Enabling environment (E) to retain health officials and further strengthen their capacities to deal with trade-related health issues. This INNE model seems to have worked well in Thailand. However, other contextual factors are also significant. This article suggests that, in building capacity in GHD, it is essential to educate both health and non-health actors on global health issues and to use a combination of formal and informal mechanisms to participate in GHD. And in developing sustainable capacity in GHD, it requires long term commitment and strong leadership from both health and non-health sectors.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This article calls for a universally standard classification of these smokeless carcinogenic products as tobacco products and thus, subject to the same public health and clinical protections applied to other forms of tobacco. This recommendation is guided by scientific evidence strongly indicating the common presence of tobacco in paan and paan masala.

Respondents reported their smoking status, health conditions and healthcare expenditures. Relative risks were obtained from published sources. Healthcare costs included annual outpatient and inpatient hospitalisation expenditures for five SHS-related diseases: asthma, breast cancer (female only), heart disease, lung cancer and tuberculosis. SHS-attributable healthcare costs were estimated using a prevalence-based annual cost approach.--NEW SECTION--The total healthcare costs of SHS exposure in rural China amounted to $1.2 billion in 2011, including $559 million for outpatient visits and $612.4 million for inpatient hospitalisations. The healthcare costs for women and men were $877.1 million and $294.3 million, respectively. Heart disease was the most costly condition for both women ($701.7 million) and men ($180.6 million). The total healthcare costs of SHS exposure in rural China accounted to 0.3% of China's national healthcare expenditures in 2011. Over one-fifth of the total healthcare costs of SHS exposure in rural China were paid by health insurance. The out-of-pocket expenditures per person accounted for almost half (47%) of their daily income.--NEW SECTION--The adverse health effects of SHS exposure result in a large economic burden in China.

25335113,10.3892/ijo.2014.2716,Downregulation of thymidylate synthase and E2F1 by arsenic trioxide in mesothelioma.,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a global health issue. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to suppress thymidylate synthase (TYMS) in lung adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, and induce apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia. With TYMS as a putative therapeutic target, the effect of ATO in mesothelioma was therefore studied. A panel of 5 mesothelioma cell lines was used to study the effect of ATO on cell viability, protein expression, mRNA expression and TYMS activity by MTT assay, western blot, qPCR and tritium-release assay, respectively. The knockdown of TYMS and E2F1 was performed with a specific siRNA. Phosphatidylserine externalization and mitochondrial membrane depolarization were measured by Annexin V and JC-1 staining respectively. The in vivo effect of ATO was studied using a nude mouse xenograft model. Application of ATO demonstrated anticancer effects in the cell line model with clinically achievable concentrations. Downregulation of TYMS protein (except H226 cells and 1.25 µM ATO in H2052 cells) and mRNA expression (H28 cells), pRB1 (H28 cells) and E2F1 and TYMS activity (except H226 cells) were also evident. E2F1 knockdown decreased cell viability more significantly than TYMS knockdown. In general, thymidine kinase 1, ribonucleotide reductase M1, c-myc and skp2 were downregulated by ATO. p-c-Jun was downregulated in H28 cells while upregulated in 211H cells. Phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and upregulation of Bak and cleaved caspase-3 were observed. In the H226 xenograft model, the relative tumor growth was aborted, and E2F1 was downregulated while cleaved caspase-3 was elevated and localized to the nucleus in the ATO treatment group. ATO has potent antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in mesothelioma in vitro and in vivo, partially mediated through E2F1 targeting (less effect through TYMS targeting). There is sound scientific evidence to support the clinical application of ATO in treatment of mesothelioma.",eng,International journal of oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

HRQoL was measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D. Information on cancer site and stage was collected using the patients' medical records. Multiple linear regression analysis estimated the relative impact of economic characteristics (i.e. health insurance, employment status, household income and economic hardship) on HRQoL.--NEW SECTION--All economic characteristics were significant independent determinants of HRQoL, when we controlled for demographic and clinical characteristics. Economic hardship was found to be most important. The adjusted mean differences in HRQoL scores between patients who had experienced economic hardship in the year before diagnosis compared to patients who did not were -5.6, -6.7, -7.3 and -0.06, respectively, for global health, physical function, emotional function and the EQ-5D index (all p values <0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that this significant result for economic hardship as a predictor of poor HRQoL was consistent across all age groups, for males and females, and across all levels of education.--NEW SECTION--Living in poor economic circumstances before a cancer diagnosis is associated with greatly impaired HRQoL after diagnosis. There is wide scope for research on innovative interventions that provide low-cost and targeted support aimed to improve health outcomes of disadvantaged cancer patients in low- and middle-income settings.",eng,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Causes of death were assigned by physicians trained in the International Classification of Diseases, version 10. All data were entered and processed electronically using a secure study website.--NEW SECTION--Verbal autopsies were completed for 98.2% (5786) of the deaths (5895) recorded. The crude death rate was 8.0/1000. 4.8% (95% CI 4.3-5.4) of all deaths were suicides, giving a suicide rate of 37.5/100,000 population. Forty-three percent of suicides occurred in the age group 15-29 years, and 62% were in men. In the younger age groups (10-29 years), suicides by women (56%) were more common than by men (44%). Poisoning (40%) was the most common method of self-harm followed by hanging (12%).--NEW SECTION--The suicide rate in this part of rural Andhra Pradesh is three times higher than the national average of 11.2/100,000, but is in line with that reported in the Million Death Study.

We investigated antibiotic use in children by determining the proportion of unselected children with antibacterial activity in their urine attending a paediatric outpatient department in Siem Reap, Cambodia.--NEW SECTION--Caregiver reports of medication history and presence of possible infection symptoms were collected in addition to urine samples. Urine antibiotic activity was estimated by exposing bacteria to urine specimens, including assessment against multiresistant bacteria previously isolated from patients in the hospital (a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a multiresistant Salmonella typhi and an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli isolate).--NEW SECTION--Medication information and urine were collected from 775 children. Caregivers reported medication use in 69.0% of children in the preceding 48 h. 31.7% samples showed antibacterial activity; 16.3% showed activity against a local multiresistant organism. No specimens demonstrated activity against an ESBL-producing E. coli.--NEW SECTION--Antibiotics are widely used in the community setting in Cambodia. Parents are often ill-informed about drugs given to treat their children. Increasing the regulation and training of private pharmacies in Cambodia may be necessary. Regional surveillance of antibiotic use and resistance is also essential in devising preventive strategies against further development of antibiotic resistance, which would have both local and global consequences.",eng,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25320323,10.1128/JVI.02425-14,Contact-induced mitochondrial polarization supports HIV-1 virological synapse formation.,"Rapid HIV-1 spread between CD4 T lymphocytes occurs at retrovirus-induced immune cell contacts called virological synapses (VS). VS are associated with striking T cell polarization and localized virus budding at the site of contact that facilitates cell-cell spread. In addition to this, spatial clustering of organelles, including mitochondria, to the contact zone has been previously shown. However, whether cell-cell contact specifically induces dynamic T cell remodeling during VS formation and what regulates this process remain unclear. Here, we report that contact between an HIV-1-infected T cell and an uninfected target T cell specifically triggers polarization of mitochondria concomitant with recruitment of the major HIV-1 structural protein Gag to the site of cell-cell contact. Using fixed and live-cell imaging, we show that mitochondrial and Gag polarization in HIV-1-infected T cells occurs within minutes of contact with target T cells, requires the formation of stable cell-cell contacts, and is an active, calcium-dependent process. We also find that perturbation of mitochondrial polarization impairs cell-cell spread of HIV-1 at the VS. Taken together, these data suggest that HIV-1-infected T cells are able to sense and respond to contact with susceptible target cells and undergo dynamic cytoplasmic remodeling to create a synaptic environment that supports efficient HIV-1 VS formation between CD4 T lymphocytes.--NEW SECTION--HIV-1 remains one of the major global health challenges of modern times. The capacity of HIV-1 to cause disease depends on the virus's ability to spread between immune cells, most notably CD4 T lymphocytes. Cell-cell transmission is the most efficient way of HIV-1 spread and occurs at the virological synapse (VS). The VS forms at the site of contact between an infected cell and an uninfected cell and is characterized by polarized assembly and budding of virions and clustering of cellular organelles, including mitochondria. Here, we show that cell-cell contact induces rapid recruitment of mitochondria to the contact site and that this supports efficient VS formation and consequently cell-cell spread. Additionally, we observed that cell-cell contact induces a mitochondrion-dependent increase in intracellular calcium, indicative of cellular signaling. Taken together, our data suggest that VS formation is a regulated process and thus a potential target to block HIV-1 cell-cell spread.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25320309,10.1128/JVI.02393-14,Identification of a neutralizing epitope within antigenic domain 5 of glycoprotein B of human cytomegalovirus.,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important, ubiquitous pathogen that causes severe clinical disease in immunocompromised individuals, such as organ transplant recipients and infants infected in utero. The envelope glycoprotein B (gB) of HCMV is a major antigen for the induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies. We have begun to define target structures within gB that are recognized by virus-neutralizing antibodies. Antigenic domain 5 (AD-5) of gB has been identified as an important target for neutralizing antibodies in studies using human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Anti-AD-5 MAbs share a target site on gB, despite originating from different, healthy, HCMV-infected donors. Mutational analysis of AD-5 identified tyrosine 280 in combination with other surface-exposed residues (the YNND epitope) as critical for antibody binding. The YNND epitope is strictly conserved among different HCMV strains. Recombinant viruses carrying YNND mutations in AD-5 were resistant to virus-neutralizing MAbs. Competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with human HCMV-convalescent-phase sera from unselected donors confirmed the conserved antibody response for the YNND epitope in HCMV-infected individuals and, because a significant fraction of the gB AD-5 response was directed against the YNND epitope, further argued that this epitope is a major target of anti-AD-5 antibody responses. In addition, affinity-purified polyclonal anti-AD-5 antibodies prepared from individual sera showed reactivity to AD-5 and neutralization activity toward gB mutant viruses that were similar to those of AD-5-specific MAbs. Taken together, our data indicate that the YNND epitope represents an important target for anti-gB antibody responses as well as for anti-AD-5 virus-neutralizing antibodies.--NEW SECTION--HCMV is a major global health concern, and a vaccine to prevent HCMV disease is a widely recognized medical need. Glycoprotein B of HCMV is an important target for neutralizing antibodies and hence an interesting molecule for intervention strategies, e.g., vaccination. Mapping the target structures of neutralizing antibodies induced by naturally occurring HCMV infection can aid in defining the properties required for a protective capacity of vaccine antigens. The data presented here extend our knowledge of neutralizing epitopes within gB to include AD-5. Collectively, our data will contribute to optimal vaccine design and development of antibody-based therapies.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Moreover, iron deficiency is the most prevalent nutritional concern worldwide with many associated cognitive and neural ramifications. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which iron enters the brain and how those processes are regulated addresses significant global health issues. The existing paradigm assumes that the endothelial cells (ECs) forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) serve as a simple conduit for transport of transferrin-bound iron. This concept is a significant oversimplification, at minimum failing to account for the iron needs of the ECs. Using an in vivo model of brain iron deficiency, the Belgrade rat, we show the distribution of transferrin receptors in brain microvasculature is altered in luminal, intracellular, and abluminal membranes dependent on brain iron status. We used a cell culture model of the BBB to show the presence of factors that influence iron release in non-human primate cerebrospinal fluid and conditioned media from astrocytes; specifically apo-transferrin and hepcidin were found to increase and decrease iron release, respectively. These data have been integrated into an interactive model where BBB ECs are central in the regulation of cerebral iron metabolism.",eng,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations advise the administration of a once-daily, oral, prophylactic regimen of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine (NVP) from birth until 4 to 6 weeks of age for infants born to HIV-infected mothers in regions without access to safe and nutritionally adequate alternatives to breast milk. A critical factor driving the successful implementation of the WHO guidelines involves sustaining high adherence to the frequent dosing. With these challenges in mind, we have developed the first injectable, sustained-release NVP formulations with the goal of providing, for 6 weeks or longer, preventative plasma drug levels from a single subcutaneous administration at birth. The long-acting NVP consists of large (>50 μm), monodisperse NVP particles coated with biocompatible polymers that control the drug release kinetics. Two lead formulations exhibiting burst-free, sustained-release kinetics for up to 75 days in vitro were developed. Subsequent in vivo studies in rats demonstrated no toxicity related to the formulations. Rat plasma NVP concentrations were above the analytical assay's limit of quantification for up to 28 days. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the rat plasma NVP concentration-time data allowed absorption rate constants to be calculated. These data then were used to simulate infant NVP exposure from a single injected dose (<200 mg) of our long-acting formulations, demonstrating preliminary feasibility of the technology to maintain safe, preventative NVP plasma levels (0.2 to 3.0 μg ml(-1)) for 6 weeks or longer.",eng,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Communication technology increasingly plays a role in decision-making about health and environmental behaviors and is being leveraged to influence that process. But at its root is the fundamental need to understand human cognition, communication, and behavior. The concept of 'One Health' has emerged as a framework for interdisciplinary work that cuts across human, animal, and ecosystem health in recognition of their interdependence and the value of an integrated perspective. Yet, the science of communication, information studies, social psychology, and other social sciences have remained marginalized in this emergence.

In addition, head and neck cancer exhibits a high recurrence rate, readily causing second primary cancers in other locations, often yielding a poor prognosis. Current medical and surgical treatment options result in considerable impairment of speaking and swallowing functions, with side effects such as nausea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and renal damage, thereby impairing patients' quality of life. Thus, developing a prevention and therapeutic intervention strategy for head and neck cancer is vital. Phytochemicals have been shown to have a unique ability to protect cells from damage and modulation of cell repair. The chemopreventive activities of phytochemicals have also been demonstrated to be associated with their antioxidant properties and the induction and stimulation of intercellular communication via gap junctions, which play a role in the regulation of cancer cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, and stagnate cancer cell growth. Phytochemicals can also regulate cancer cell signaling pathways, reduce the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells, and protect normal cells during treatment, thus reducing the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The most studied of the chemopreventive effects of phytochemicals are the carotenoids and phenolics. In this review, we investigated the multiple mechanisms of carotenoids and polyphenols (PPs) for use in preventing head and neck cancer, reducing the side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, improving patient survival rates, and reducing the occurrence rate of second primary cancers.",eng,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This study was aimed to determine the frequency of MDR H. pylori strains in Iran. H. pylori isolates were obtained from cultured gastric biopsy samples on selective culture media after their characterization by PCR and conventional biochemical methods. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ampicillin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline were determined for 111 strains that were isolated from 197 dyspeptic patients by the agar dilution method. The primary resistance rates were 61.3% (68/111) for metronidazole, 15.3% (17/111) for ampicillin, and 14.4% (16/111) for rifampicin. Resistance rates for other antimicrobials were as follows: macrolides (erythromycin or clarithromycin) 32.4% (36/111) and quinolones (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin) 30.6% (34/111).

The quadruple drug resistance phenotype encompasses 37.9% of the MDR strains, of which 90% of them was resistant to metronidazole. In conclusion, these results showed a high frequency of MDR phenotypes among the studied H. pylori strains in Iran.

Lesotho offers a representative case study on global health governance, given the country's high HIV burden and heavy dependence on foreign donor nations to implement local HIV prevention initiatives. In this paper, I use the case of VMMC opposition in Lesotho to examine how the new era of 'partnerships' has shifted the architecture of contemporary global health, specifically considering how global agreements are translated or negotiated into local practice. I argue that Lesotho's domestic policy-makers, in employing national statistics to assess if VMMC is an effective approach to addressing the local epidemic, are asserting a claim of expertise. In doing so, they challenge the traditional structures of global health politics, which have largely been managed by experts and funders from and in the global North.

The global waterpipe epidemic is likely driven by (1) the introduction of manufactured flavoured tobacco (Maassel); (2) the intersection between waterpipe's social dimension and thriving café culture; (3) the evolution of mass communication media; (4) the lack of regulatory/policy framework specific to the waterpipe. Waterpipe smoking is becoming the most popular tobacco use method among youth in the Middle East, and is quickly gaining popularity elsewhere. Important patterns of waterpipe smoking include the predominance among younger, male, high socioeconomic, and urban groups. Intermittent and social use are also noted patterns.--NEW SECTION--Waterpipe smoking has become a global public health problem. Developing surveillance, intervention and regulatory/policy frameworks specific to the waterpipe has become a public health priority.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In this study we aimed to determine the degree of association between oral HRQoL and global HRQoL in SSc.--NEW SECTION--Subjects were recruited from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group registry. Global HRQoL was measured using the Medical Outcomes Trust 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and oral HRQoL with the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP). The Medsger Disease Severity Score was used to determine organ involvement. Multivariate regression models determined the independent association of the OHIP with the SF-36 after adjusting for confounders.--NEW SECTION--This study included 156 SSc subjects. The majority (90%) were women, with a mean age of 56 years, mean disease duration 13.8 years (s.d. 8.5) and 29% of the subjects had dcSSc. Mean total OHIP score was 40.8 (s.d. 32.4). Mean SF-36 mental component summary (MCS) score was 49.7 (s.d. 11.1) and physical component summary (PCS) score was 37.0 (s.d. 10.7). In adjusted analyses, the total OHIP score was significantly associated with the SF-36 MCS and PCS, accounting for 9.7% and 5.6% of their respective variances. Measures of disease severity were not related to OHIP score.--NEW SECTION--Oral HRQoL in SSc is independently associated with global HRQoL. Oral HRQoL, however, is not related to physician-assessed disease severity. This suggests that physicians may be disregarding issues related to oral health. HRQoL is an additional dimension of HRQoL not captured by generic instruments such as the SF-36.",eng,"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25287718,10.1002/pro.2578,Design and characterization of ebolavirus GP prehairpin intermediate mimics as drug targets.,"Ebolaviruses are highly lethal filoviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. With no approved treatments or preventatives, the development of an anti-ebolavirus therapy to protect against natural infections and potential weaponization is an urgent global health need. Here, we describe the design, biophysical characterization, and validation of peptide mimics of the ebolavirus N-trimer, a highly conserved region of the GP2 fusion protein, to be used as targets to develop broad-spectrum inhibitors of ebolavirus entry. The N-trimer region of GP2 is 90% identical across all ebolavirus species and forms a critical part of the prehairpin intermediate that is exposed during viral entry. Specifically, we fused designed coiled coils to the N-trimer to present it as a soluble trimeric coiled coil as it appears during membrane fusion. Circular dichroism, sedimentation equilibrium, and X-ray crystallography analyses reveal the helical, trimeric structure of the designed N-trimer mimic targets. Surface plasmon resonance studies validate that the N-trimer mimic binds its native ligand, the C-peptide region of GP2. The longest N-trimer mimic also inhibits virus entry, thereby confirming binding of the C-peptide region during viral entry and the presence of a vulnerable prehairpin intermediate. Using phage display as a model system, we validate the suitability of the N-trimer mimics as drug screening targets. Finally, we describe the foundational work to use the N-trimer mimics as targets in mirror-image phage display, which will be used to identify D-peptide inhibitors of ebolavirus entry.",eng,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Interleukin (IL)-17A has been shown to be involved in regulating viral and allergic lung inflammatory responses, which has led to a more recent interest in its role in RSV infection. Using a neonatal mouse model of RSV, we demonstrate that neonates fail to develop IL-17A responses compared with adult mice; the main immediate IL-17A contributor in adults were γδ T cells. Antibody neutralization of IL-17A in adult mice caused increased lung inflammation and airway mucus from RSV, whereas exogenous IL-17A administration to RSV-infected neonates caused decreased inflammation but no change in airway mucus. We also observed a lack of pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1β, IL-6) from infected neonates. Using human cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we compared inflammasome activation by direct retinoic acid-inducible gene I agonism; CBMCs failed to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines or IL-17A(+) γδ T cells compared with PBMCs. Our results indicate that RSV disease severity is in part mediated by a lack of inflammasome activation and IL-17A production in neonates.",eng,Immunology and cell biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25267443,10.1002/stem.1857,Concise review: The obesity cancer paradigm: exploration of the interactions and crosstalk with adipose stem cells.,"With the recognition of obesity as a global health crisis, researchers have devoted greater effort to defining and understanding the pathophysiological molecular pathways regulating the biology of adipose tissue and obesity. Obesity, the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue due to hyperplasia and hypertrophy, has been linked to an increased incidence and aggressiveness of colon, hematological, prostate, and postmenopausal breast cancers. The increased morbidity and mortality of obesity-associated cancers have been attributed to higher levels of hormones, adipokines, and cytokines secreted by the adipose tissue. The increased amount of adipose tissue also results in higher numbers of adipose stromal/stem cells (ASCs). These ASCs have been shown to impact cancer progression directly through several mechanisms, including the increased recruitment of ASCs to the tumor site and increased production of cytokines and growth factors by ASCs and other cells within the tumor stroma. Emerging evidence indicates that obesity induces alterations in the biologic properties of ASCs, subsequently leading to enhanced tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer cells. This review will discuss the links between obesity and cancer tumor progression, including obesity-associated changes in adipose tissue, inflammation, adipokines, and chemokines. Novel topics will include a discussion of the contribution of ASCs to this complex system with an emphasis on their role in the tumor stroma. The reciprocal and circular feedback loop between obesity and ASCs as well as the mechanisms by which ASCs from obese patients alter the biology of cancer cells and enhance tumorigenesis will be discussed.",eng,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Self-report questionnaires were administered to 710 adolescents attending California continuation high schools at baseline and at 1-year follow-up between 2006 and 2008. Cross-sectionally, predictor and outcome measures were correlated. However, in longitudinal analyses, only tobacco use myths predicted change in outcome measures.

To facilitate quality improvement initiatives, baseline knowledge of capacity for surgical, anaesthetic, emergency and obstetric care is critical. In partnership with the Malawi Ministry of Health, we quantified government hospitals' surgical capacity through workforce, infrastructure and health service delivery components.--NEW SECTION--From November 2012 to January 2013, we surveyed district and mission hospital administrators and clinical staff onsite using a modified version of the Personnel, Infrastructure, Procedures, Equipment and Supplies (PIPES) tool from Surgeons OverSeas. We calculated percentage of facilities demonstrating adequacy of the assessed components, surgical case rates, operating theatre density and surgical workforce density.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-seven government hospitals were surveyed (90% of the district hospitals, all central hospitals). Of the surgical workforce surveyed (n = 370), 92.7% were non-surgeons and 77% were clinical officers (COs). Of the 109 anaesthesia providers, 95.4% were non-physician anaesthetists (anaesthesia COs or ACOs). Non-surgeons and ACOs were the only providers of surgical services and anaesthetic services in 85% and 88.9% of hospitals, respectively. No specialists served the district hospitals. All of the hospitals experienced periods without external electricity. Most did not always have a functioning generator (78.3% district, 25% central) or running water (82.6%, 50%). None of the district hospitals had an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Cricothyroidotomy, bowel resection and cholecystectomy were not done in over two-thirds of hospitals. Every hospital provided general anaesthesia but some did not always have a functioning anaesthesia machine (52.2%, 50%). Surgical rate, operating theatre density and surgical workforce density per 100 000 population was 289.48-747.38 procedures, 0.98 and 5.41 and 3.68 surgical providers, respectively.--NEW SECTION--COs form the backbone of Malawi's surgical and anaesthetic workforce and should be supported with improvements in infrastructure as well as training and mentorship by specialist surgeons and anaesthetists.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Research questions focused on the disease costs from a societal perspective and HRQoL burden in adults and pediatric/adolescent patients according to disease stage/severity. Total, direct and indirect costs were identified, as well as the impact of CD on HRQoL measured using both generic and disease-specific instruments.--NEW SECTION--Overall, 61 publications met the research criteria (38 on costs, 23 on HRQoL). CD in the USA and Europe together was associated with annual total costs of nearly <euro>30 billion, more than half due to indirect costs. HRQoL was consistently and statistically significantly lower among CD patients compared with normal populations, due to physical, emotional and social effects.--NEW SECTION--CD is a global health problem with high societal costs and substantial HRQoL burden.

I then examine the ways in which the capacities of CHWs were valued by the institutions that deployed them. NGO and government officials recognized that empathic care was crucial to both saving and improving the quality of people's lives. These institutional actors also defended a policy of not financially remunerating CHWs, partly by constructing their capacities as so valuable that they become ""priceless"" and therefore only remunerable with immaterial satisfaction.

Essential medicines are central to treating chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Our study aimed to quantify access to essential medicines for people with chronic conditions in five low- and middle-income countries and to evaluate how household socioeconomic status and perceptions about medicines availability and affordability influence access. We analysed data for 1867 individuals with chronic diseases from national surveys (Ghana, Jordan, Kenya, Philippines and Uganda) conducted in 2007-10 using a standard World Health Organization (WHO) methodology to measure medicines access and use. We defined individuals as having access to medicines if they reported regularly taking medicine for a diagnosed chronic disease and data collectors found a medicine indicated for that disease in their homes. We used logistic regression models accounting for the clustered survey design to investigate determinants of keeping medicines at home and predictors of access to medicines for chronic diseases. Less than half of individuals previously diagnosed with a chronic disease had access to medicines for their condition in every country, from 16% in Uganda to 49% in Jordan. Other than reporting a chronic disease, higher household socioeconomic level was the most significant predictor of having any medicines available at home. The likelihood of having access to medicines for chronic diseases was higher for those with medicines insurance coverage [highest adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.12 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.38, 7.07)] and lower for those with past history of borrowing money to pay for medicines [lowest adjusted OR 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.92)].

25252586,10.14670/HH-30.245,Ependymal damage in a Plasmodium yoelii yoelii lethal murine malaria model.,"Malaria continues to be a major global health problem, and over 40% of the world's population is at risk. Severe or complicated malaria is defined by clinical or laboratory evidence of vital organ dysfunction, including dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS). The pathogenesis of complicated malaria has not been completely elucidated; however, the development of the multiorgan affection seems to play an important role in the disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) that protects the CNS against chemical insults. Historically, the BBB has received more attention in the pathogenesis of malaria than have the cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier (CSFBB) and ependymal cells. This perspective may be misguided because, in the context of disease or toxicity, the CSFBB is more vulnerable to many foreign invaders than are the capillaries. Given the lack on studies of the damage to the CSFBB and ependymal epithelium in experimental murine malaria, the present study evaluated morphological changes in the ependymal cells of CD-1 male mice infected with lethal Plasmodium yoelii yoelii (Pyy) via histopathology and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Samples were taken two, four and six days post-infection (PI). No lesions were observed upon the initial infection. By the fourth day PI, fourth ventricle ependymal samples exhibited disruptions and roughened epithelia. More severe injuries were observed at six days PI and included thickened cilia and deep separations between the ependymal intercellular spaces. In some of the analyzed areas, the absence of microvilli and cell layer detachment were observed, and some areas exhibited blebbing surfaces. The ependymal cell lesions observed in the CD1 male mice infected with lethal Pyy seemed to facilitate the paracellular permeability of the CSFBB and consequently promote the access of inflammatory mediators and toxic molecules through the barrier, which resulted in damage to the brain tissue. Understanding the mechanism of ependymal disruption during lethal murine malaria could help to elucidate the local and systemic factors that are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease and may provide essential clues for the prevention and treatment of complicated human malaria.",eng,Histology and histopathology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25251876,10.1111/resp.12385,Lung function abnormalities in HIV-infected adults and children.,"Despite the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic remains a global health crisis with a high burden of respiratory disease among infected persons. While the early complications of the epidemic were dominated by opportunistic infections, improved survival has led to the emergence of non-infectious conditions that are associated with chronic respiratory symptoms and pulmonary disability. Obstructive ventilatory defects and reduced diffusing capacity are common findings in adults, and the association between HIV and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is increasingly recognized. There is synergism between viral factors, opportunistic infections, conventional influences like tobacco smoke and biomass fuel exposure, and potentially, the immunological effects of ART on the development of HIV-associated chronic obstructive lung disease. Pulmonary function data for HIV-infected infants and children are scarce, but shows that bronchiectasis and obliterative bronchiolitis with severe airflow limitation are major problems, particularly in the developing world. However, studies from these regions are sorely lacking. There is thus a major unmet need to understand the influences of chronic HIV infection on the lung in both adults and children, and to devise strategies to manage and prevent these diseases in HIV-infected individuals. It is important for clinicians working with HIV-infected individuals to have an appreciation of their effects on measurements of lung function. This review therefore summarizes the lung function abnormalities described in HIV-positive adults and children, with an emphasis on obstructive lung disease, and examines potential pathogenic links between HIV and the development of chronic pulmonary disability.",eng,"Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Feasible goals with some quantifiable, measurable targets can influence governments. We propose, as a quatitative health target, ""Avoid in each country 40% of premature deaths (under-70 deaths that would be seen in the 2030 population at 2010 death rates), and improve health care at all ages"". Targeting overall mortality and improved health care ignores no modifiable cause of death, nor any cause of disability that is treatable (or also causes many deaths). 40% fewer premature deaths would be important in all countries, but implies very different priorities in different populations. Reinforcing this target for overall mortality in each country are four global subtargets for 2030: avoid two-thirds of child and maternal deaths; two-thirds of tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria deaths; a third of premature deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs); and a third of those from other causes (other communicable diseases, undernutrition, and injuries). These challenging subtargets would halve under-50 deaths, avoid a third of the (mainly NCD) deaths at ages 50-69 years, and so avoid 40% of under-70 deaths. To help assess feasibility, we review mortality rates and trends in the 25 most populous countries, in four country income groupings, and worldwide.--NEW SECTION--UN sources yielded overall 1970-2010 mortality trends. WHO sources yielded cause-specific 2000-10 trends, standardised to country-specific 2030 populations; decreases per decade of 42% or 18% would yield 20-year reductions of two-thirds or a third.--NEW SECTION--Throughout the world, except in countries where the effects of HIV or political disturbances predominated, mortality decreased substantially from 1970-2010, particularly in childhood. From 2000-10, under-70 age-standardised mortality rates decreased 19% (with the low-income and lower-middle-income countries having the greatest absolute gains). The proportional decreases per decade (2000-10) were: 34% at ages 0-4 years; 17% at ages 5-49 years; 15% at ages 50-69 years; 30% for communicable, perinatal, maternal, or nutritional causes; 14% for NCDs; and 13% for injuries (accident, suicide, or homicide).--NEW SECTION--Moderate acceleration of the 2000-10 proportional decreases in mortality could be feasible, achieving the targeted 2030 disease-specific reductions of two-thirds or a third. If achieved, these reductions avoid about 10 million of the 20 million deaths at ages 0-49 years that would be seen in 2030 at 2010 death rates, and about 17 million of the 41 million such deaths at ages 0-69 years.

The origin of SCD lies in the malarial regions of the tropics where carriers are protected against death from malaria and hence enjoy an evolutionary advantage. More recently, population migration has meant that SCD now has a worldwide distribution and that a substantial number of children are born with the condition in higher-income areas, including large parts of Europe and North and South America. Newborn screening, systematic clinical follow-up and prevention of sepsis and organ damage have led to an increased life expectancy among people with SCD in many such countries; however, in resource-limited settings where the majority continue to be born, most affected children continue to die in early childhood, usually undiagnosed, due to the lack of effective programmes for its early detection and treatment.

Data from same questionnaires (European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and H&N35 questionnaires) were exacted and we analyzed four items (global health status, dry mouth and sticky saliva, swallowing, social eating and social contact), which have a close relationship with xerostomia-related QoL. Results indicated that a maximal deterioration of most QoL scales including global health status developed during treatment or at the end of the treatment course and then followed by a gradual recovery to 1 year, 1-2 years after IMRT, compared with their baseline level, some specific head and neck items, most in the EORTC QLQ H&N35, remained worse for the surviving patients. In conclusion, the published data reasonably support the benefits of IMRT in improving QoL, but xerostomia-related items still had a significantly negative effect in 2 years to impact a survivor's QoL.",eng,Expert review of anticancer therapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25229995,10.1111/phn.12149,The Impact of Nurses on Neglected Tropical Disease Management.,"Although Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are largely endemic in the developing nations of Africa, Asia, and South and Central America, they are reemerging with increasing frequency in developed countries. Their diagnosis, treatment, and control are an increasing public health concern that requires a different awareness by health care providers. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are chronic infectious diseases which disproportionately burden poor, rural, and marginalized populations with significant mortality and high morbidity (disability, disfigurement, impaired childhood growth and cognitive development, increased vulnerability to coinfection) that reinforces their poverty. What can we learn from the nurses in developing countries already battling NTD's that could be useful in the developed world? This article provides an overview of distribution, pathophysiology, symptoms, and management of 13 NTDs, with particular attention to the role of nurses in delivering cost-effective integrated interventions. Case studies of schistosomiasis, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis address recognition and treatment of infected individuals in developed nations where NTD infection is limited primarily to immigrants and travelers.",eng,"Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
25228753,10.1093/ndt/gfu300,Uromodulin: from monogenic to multifactorial diseases.,"Uromodulin, the major protein secreted in normal urine, is exclusively produced in the thick ascending limb (TAL) cells of the kidney. The exact role uromodulin (UMOD) plays in renal physiology remains enigmatic. UMOD has been linked to water/electrolyte balance and to kidney innate immunity and it is believed to protect against urinary tract infections and renal stones. A renewed interest in UMOD has been triggered by the identification of UMOD mutations as cause of hereditary dominant renal diseases, now referred to as uromodulin-associated kidney diseases (UAKDs), presenting with tubulointerstitial fibrosis, defective urinary concentration, hyperuricaemia and gout, and progressive renal failure. In UAKDs, the key primary pathogenetic event is a delayed intracellular trafficking of mutant UMOD, causing its intracellular accumulation. In the last decade, multiple genome-wide association studies have identified common variants in the UMOD gene, causing independent susceptibility to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, two complex traits representing major global health problems. The biological mechanism underlying the association between UMOD risk variants and susceptibility to CKD and hypertension was not understood until last year, when the link between UMOD and hypertension was found to be caused by overactivation of the TAL sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter NKCC2, pointing to UMOD as a therapeutic target for lowering blood pressure and preserving renal function.",eng,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

25218795,10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.09.003,The global condition of epidemics: Panoramas in A (H1N1) influenza and their consequences for One World One Health programme.,"Among the most relevant elements contributing to define the One World One Health programme we find epidemics. The reason is that in recent decades, infectious diseases such as HIV/SIDA, SARS and Influenza have shown that we need new approaches and concepts in order to understand how biological emergencies and health alerts deploy new scales of action. Especially relevant has been the case of A(H1N1) influenza. This reached the status of global threat virtually from its onset, triggering an international response with a diffusion, visibility and rapidity unparalleled in previous health alerts. This article maintains that this global condition cannot be explained solely by the epidemiologic characteristics of the disease, such as mortality rate, severe cases, propagation capacity, etc. Resorting to the approach proposed by the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), this paper suggests that the action of certain socio-technical operators was what built a heterogeneous network of ideas, concepts and materials that turned the A (H1N1) influenza into a global-scale phenomenon with unprecedented speed. Among these operators, the most important ones were: the speaking position, a discourse about threat, the protocols and guidelines that were used and, lastly, the maps that allowed a real-time monitoring of the influenza. The paper ends with the notion of panorama, as defined by Bruno Latour: a suggestion to describe the common denominator of the aforementioned operators, and a means to foresee the development of global scales for certain health alerts. The paper will conclude by proposing that this type of analysis would allow the One World One Health to understand with greater precision the dynamic of epidemics and thus make its principles of action much more specific as well as its definition of what global health should be.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

A prospective policy analysis of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement.,"The Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) is one of a new generation of 'deep' preferential trade and investment agreements that will extend many of the provisions seen in previous agreements. This paper presents a prospective policy analysis of the likely text of the TPPA, with reference to nutrition policy space. Specifically, we analyse how the TPPA may constrain governments' policy space to implement the 'policy options for promoting a healthy diet' in the World Health Organization's Global Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) 2013-2020. This policy analysis suggests that if certain binding commitments are made under the TPPA, they could constrain the ability of governments to protect nutrition policy from the influence of vested interests, reduce the range of interventions available to actively discourage consumption of less healthy food (and to promote healthy food) and limit governments' capacity to implement these interventions, and reduce resources available for nutrition education initiatives. There is scope to protect policy space by including specific exclusions and/or exceptions during negotiation of trade and investment agreements like the TPPA, and by strengthening global health frameworks for nutrition to enable them to be used as reference during disputes in trade fora.",eng,"Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Risk factors such as obesity and hypertension that accelerate the development of CVD begin in childhood. Ethnicity is a known risk factor for CVD in adults. The aim of this study is to explore differences in the prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia among overweight/obese and normal-weight children/adolescents of three different ethnic origins living in Central Europe.--NEW SECTION--Prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia was calculated among obese/overweight children/adolescents (n = 25,986; mean age 12.7 ± 3.0 years; range: 0-18 years; 46% males) documented in the German-Austrian-Swiss APV (Prospective Documentation of Overweight Children and Adolescents) registry and among normal-weight subjects (n = 14,935; mean age: 8.8 ± 5.1 years; range 0-18 years; 51% males) from the population-based cross-sectional German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) study. In both cohorts, subjects were categorized into three ethnic groups (Central European: Germany, Austria, Switzerland; Southeastern European: Turkish; Southern European: Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Malta) based on the country of birth of both parents. Regression models were used to examine ethnic differences after adjustment for age and gender and body mass index (BMI) category.--NEW SECTION--Age-, gender- and BMI category-adjusted prevalence of hypertension were 38% and 39% for the ethnic minority groups, compared with 35% among German/Austrian/Swiss counterparts. Turkish ethnicity was significantly associated with hypertension (odds ratio (OR) 1.14; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.27; P = 0.0446). No significant ethnic differences were found in lipid levels. Prevalence of hypertension found among normal-weight subjects (Central European vs Southeastern vs Southern European: 6.8% vs 6.3% vs 7.2%) did not differ significantly.--NEW SECTION--Turkish obese/overweight children/adolescents showed a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension relative to their peers of Central European descent. No significant ethnic difference in the prevalence of hypertension was found among normal-weight children/adolescents. The high prevalence of hypertension among Turkish obese/overweight children/adolescents indicates the need for greater preventive and therapeutic efforts to reduce cardiovascular risk factors among vulnerable populations.",eng,International journal of obesity (2005),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

While medical anthropologists have been conducting qualitative research in resource-poor settings for decades, they are increasingly called on to train ""local"" clinicians, researchers, and students in qualitative research methods. In this article, I describe the process of teaching introductory courses in qualitative research methods to Haitian clinicians, hospital staff, and medical students, who rarely encounter qualitative research in their training or practice. These trainings allow participants to identify and begin to address challenges related to health services delivery, quality of care, and provider-patient relations. However, they also run the risk of perpetuating colonial legacies of objectification and reinforcing hierarchies of knowledge and knowledge production. As these trainings increase in number and scope, they offer the opportunity to reflect critically on new forms of transnational interventions that aim to reduce health disparities.",eng,Medical anthropology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, newly emerging infectious diseases (EID) and more well-established tropical disease pathogens present complex challenges to vaccine developers; in particular, neglected tropical diseases, which are most prevalent among the world's poorest, include many pathogens with large sizes, multistage life cycles and a variety of nonhuman vectors. EID such as MERS-CoV and H7N9 are highly pathogenic for humans. For many of these pathogens, while their genomes are available, immune correlates of protection are currently unknown. These complexities make developing vaccines for EID and neglected tropical diseases all the more difficult.

We used data from all three waves to examine time trends in singles availability and purchasing. To explore the association between neighbourhood access to singles and cessation behaviour, we used data from participants who were smokers at Wave 5 and followed up at Wave 6 (n=1272).--NEW SECTION--The percentage of participants who saw singles sold daily (45.2% in 2010; 51.4% in 2011; 64.9% in 2012), who bought singles at least once a week (22.3% in 2010; 29.1% in 2011; 29.1% in 2012) and whose last cigarette purchase was a single (16.6% in 2010; 20.7% in 2011; 25.8% in 2012) increased significantly from 2010 to 2012 (all p<0.001). The average percentage of residents who reported seeing singles sold daily in their neighbourhood in 2012 was 60% (SD=25%). In adjusted analyses, smokers living in neighbourhoods with higher access to singles were less likely to make a quit attempt (risk ratio (RR)=0.72; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.12), and more likely to relapse (RR=1.30; CI 0.94 to 1.82), but these results were not statistically significant.--NEW SECTION--Single cigarettes appear widely accessible in Mexico and growing in availability.

However, little is known about the association of remoteness with quality of life (QoL) for colorectal cancer survivors. We examined the relationship between distance from hospital and colorectal cancer survivors' QoL, with a specific focus on gender.--NEW SECTION--Colorectal cancer survivors in Ireland who were more than 6-months postdiagnosis completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30, measuring global health status (GHS) and physical, role, cognitive, social, and emotional functioning. Bootstrap linear regression was used to evaluate the association between remoteness and QoL scales, controlling for demographic and clinical variables. Separate models were generated for the full sample, for women, and for men.--NEW SECTION--The final analytical sample was 496 colorectal cancer survivors; 186 women and 310 men. Living remote from the treating hospital was associated with lower physical functioning (coefficient -4.38 [95 % confidence interval -8.13, -0.91]) and role functioning (coeff. -7.78 [-12.64, -2.66]) among all colorectal cancer survivors. In the separate gender models, remoteness was significantly associated with lower physical (coeff. -7.00 [-13.47, -1.49]) and role functioning (coeff. -11.50 [-19.66, -2.65]) for women, but not for men. Remoteness had a significant negative relationship to GHS (coeff. -4.31 [-8.46, -0.27]) for men.--NEW SECTION--Aspects of QoL are lower among colorectal cancer survivors who live far from their treating hospital.

Few studies in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) have investigated the role of the neighbourhood environment on smoking behaviour.--NEW SECTION--To determine whether neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation is related to smoking intensity, quit attempts, quit success and smoking relapse among a cohort of smokers in Mexico from 2010 to 2012.--NEW SECTION--Data were analysed from adult smokers and recent ex-smokers who participated in waves 4-6 of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Mexico Survey. Data were linked to the Mexican government's composite index of neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation, which is based on 2010 Mexican Census data. We used generalised estimating equations to determine associations between neighbourhood deprivation and individual smoking behaviours.--NEW SECTION--Contrary to past findings in HICs, higher neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation was associated with lower smoking intensity. Quit attempts showed a U-shaped pattern whereby smokers living in high/very high deprivation neighbourhoods and smokers living in very low deprivation neighbourhoods were more likely to make a quit attempt than smokers living in other neighbourhoods. We did not find significant differences in neighbourhood deprivation on relapse or successful quitting, with the possible exception of people living in medium-deprivation neighbourhoods having a higher likelihood of successful quitting than people living in very low deprivation neighbourhoods (p=0.06).--NEW SECTION--Neighbourhood socioeconomic environments in Mexico appear to operate in an opposing manner to those in HICs.

According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, approximately 1.37 million people die each year from lung cancer. Different therapeutic approaches as well as several treatment options exist. To date decisions on which therapies to use have largely been made by clinical experts. Comparative preference studies show that underlying weighting of treatment goals by experts is not necessarily congruent with the preferences of affected patients.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this empirical study was to ascertain patient preferences in relation to treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). After identification of patient-relevant treatment attributes via literature review and qualitative interviews(ten) a discrete-choice experiment including seven patient-relevant attributes was conducted using a fractional factorial NGene-design. Statistical data analysis was performed using latent class models.--NEW SECTION--The qualitative part of this study identified outcome measures related to efficacy, side effects and mode of administration.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the QoL in patients after TG and SG for cancer.--NEW SECTION--All surviving patients who had undergone TG or SG between 1994 and 2009 were identified from a prospectively collected database and sent the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire (QLQ-C30 v.3) and the gastric module (QLQ-STO22).--NEW SECTION--From a total of 261 patients who had undergone TG or SG in the study period, 91 were still alive and 53 responded. There was no significant difference between the QoL between TG and SG based on functional scales and global health status. However dysphagia and eating restrictions were significantly worse in the TG group.--NEW SECTION--This study has demonstrated that there is no difference in overall QoL in patients with TG or SG although eating restrictions and dysphagia are worse after TG.",eng,The surgeon : journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

This study aimed to assess levels of exposure and summarize the evidence for associations between exposures to environmental risk factors and adverse health outcomes in Mongolia, with a particular focus on children. A systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Global Health Library, CINAHL, CABI, Scopus, and mongolmed.mn electronic databases up to April 2014 . A total of 59 studies meeting the predetermined criteria were included. Results indicate that the Mongolian population has significant exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution, metals, environmental tobacco smoke, and other chemical toxins, and these risk factors have been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases among adults and respiratory diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders among children. Well-designed epidemiological investigations in vulnerable populations especially in pregnant women and children are recommended.",eng,Asia-Pacific journal of public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

For the first time, the burden of ASDs has been estimated for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010). The aims of this study were to develop global and regional prevalence models and estimate the global burden of disease of ASDs.--NEW SECTION--A systematic review was conducted for epidemiological data (prevalence, incidence, remission and mortality risk) of autistic disorder and other ASDs. Data were pooled using a Bayesian meta-regression approach while adjusting for between-study variance to derive prevalence models. Burden was calculated in terms of years lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), which are reported here by world region for 1990 and 2010.--NEW SECTION--In 2010 there were an estimated 52 million cases of ASDs, equating to a prevalence of 7.6 per 1000 or one in 132 persons. After accounting for methodological variations, there was no clear evidence of a change in prevalence for autistic disorder or other ASDs between 1990 and 2010. Worldwide, there was little regional variation in the prevalence of ASDs. Globally, autistic disorders accounted for more than 58 DALYs per 100 000 population and other ASDs accounted for 53 DALYs per 100 000.--NEW SECTION--ASDs account for substantial health loss across the lifespan. Understanding the burden of ASDs is essential for effective policy making. An accurate epidemiological description of ASDs is needed to inform public health policy and to plan for education, housing and financial support services.",eng,Psychological medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The role of student-led initiatives in global health promotion projects is also discussed.--NEW SECTION--A survey of 213 net recipients was conducted after a 12-month period to evaluate malaria prevention knowledge, and net use and maintenance.--NEW SECTION--Only 4.7% of recipients could not recall any malaria prevention methods. Seventy percent of pregnant women and 86.5% of children under five slept under a net the previous night. Only two households (0.9%) no longer possessed a net, and nets were not used in 2.3% of houses. Household observation revealed 17.4% of nets had at least one problem that would compromise effectiveness.--NEW SECTION--Student-led projects can play an important role in effectively preventing malaria. However coordination with existing programs, targeting hard-to-access groups, and training of students overcomes some common limitations of such student-led initiatives.",eng,Global health promotion,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2015

Chikungunya virus represents a new threat. Surged from remote African regions, this virus has become endemic in the Indic ocean basin, the Indian subcontinent and the southeast of Asia, causing serious epidemics in Africa, Indic Ocean Islands, Asia and Europe. Due to their epidemiological and biological features and the global presence of their vectors, chikungunya represents a serious menace and could become endemic in the Americas. Although chikungunya infection has a low mortality rate, its high attack ratio may collapse the health system during epidemics affecting a sensitive population. In this paper, we review the clinical and epidemiological features of chikungunya fever as well as the risk of its introduction into the Americas.

The Nigerian government recognizes the need to implement these priorities by putting in place the necessary policy framework, but political instability, poor infrastructural development and inadequate funding have remained barriers toward the achievement of success in implementing these priorities. The rest of the paper elucidates the fact that despite leadership and influence from the World Health Organization and other United Nations agencies, and some responses from the Nigerian government, tackling these public health problems requires much more fundamental reform to primary health services and a reduction in poverty. Although the government has shown enough political will to tackle these problems, it is expected that a better result will be achieved through injecting more funds into the Nigerian health sector, and deploying astute health administrators to manage the sector rather than pure health professionals without managerial acumen.",eng,Global health promotion,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We compared the genetic structure of the Wolaita ethnic population from Southern Ethiopia (WETH, n=120) with HapMap populations using genome-wide variants. We investigated allele frequencies of 443 clinically and pharmacogenomically relevant genetic variants in WETH compared with HapMap populations. We found that WETH were genetically most similar to the Kenya Maasai and least similar to the Japanese in HapMap. Variant alleles associated with increased risk of adverse reactions to drugs used for treating tuberculosis (rs1799929 and rs1495741 in NAT2), thromboembolism (rs7294, rs9923231 and rs9934438 in VKORC1), and HIV/AIDS and solid tumors (rs2242046 in SLC28A1) had significantly higher frequencies in WETH compared with African ancestry HapMap populations. Our results illustrate that clinically relevant pharmacogenomic loci display allele frequency differences among African populations.

Few studies have shown interactions between pairs of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be associated with BP. Although many studies use a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing to control type I error, thereby potentially reducing power, false discovery rate (FDR) approaches are also used in genome-wide studies. Renal ion balance genes have been associated with BP regulation, but, although inflammation has been studied in connection with BP, few studies have reported associations between inflammation genes and BP.--NEW SECTION--We analyzed SNP-SNP interactions among 31 SNPs from genes involved in renal ion balance and 30 SNPs from genes involved in inflammation using data from the Framingham Heart Study.--NEW SECTION--No evidence of association was found for interactions among renal ion balance SNPs for either systolic or diastolic BP. A group of 3 interactions involving 6 inflammation genes (IKBKB-NFKBIA, IKBKE-CHUK, and ADIPOR2-RETN) showed evidence of association with diastolic BP with an FDR of 4.2%; no single interaction reached experiment-wide significance.--NEW SECTION--This study identified promising and biologically plausible candidates for interactions between inflammation genes that may be associated with DBP.

Cancer of the cervix is one of the leading gynecological malignancies worldwide; though it is more prevalent in the developing countries. Fruitful approaches are needed to control cervical cancer. Awareness through proper education, screening and early detection may pave a way to combat the disease process in the first place. Surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are some of the common modes of treatment for cervical cancer. Conventional medical treatments often are not able to eliminate the offending growth fully and are not free from complications. Side effects very often are disastrous. Therefore, it is high time to focus our attention to bring about a novel way to tackle the problem. Advocating holistic approach using plant derived phytochemicals may address this health problem. These molecules show potent anticancer potential and are free from toxicity. Adjunctive therapies using phytochemicals may prove to be of tremendous importance. Plants are a prime source of effective drugs for the treatment of various forms of cancer. Many of these compounds are well characterized and have led the researchers to develop potential chemotherapeutic agents. Neutraceuticals may not replace the conventional treatment regimen, but they may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",eng,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Estimates of population-level interest in WTS over time are not documented. We assessed the popularity of WTS using World Wide Web search query results across four English-speaking countries.--NEW SECTION--We analysed trends in Google search queries related to WTS, comparing these trends with those for electronic cigarettes between 2004 and 2013 in Australia, Canada, the UK and the USA. Weekly search volumes were reported as percentages relative to the week with the highest volume of searches.--NEW SECTION--Web-based searches for WTS have increased steadily since 2004 in all four countries. Search volume for WTS was higher than for e-cigarettes in three of the four nations, with the highest volume in the USA. Online searches were primarily targeted at WTS products for home use, followed by searches for WTS cafés/lounges.--NEW SECTION--Online demand for information on WTS-related products and venues is large and increasing. Given the rise in WTS popularity, increasing evidence of exposure-related harms, and relatively lax government regulation, WTS is a serious public health concern and could reach epidemic levels in Western societies.",eng,Tobacco control,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015

All subjects with PsA who had sought health care in the period 2003-2007 were identified using a regional health-care register. In 2009, all those identified who were 18 years of age or more (n = 2,003) were sent a questionnaire with questions on smoking, health-related quality of life [EuroQol five-dimension (EQ-5D)questionnaire], function [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], pain, fatigue, and global health. We performed age- and sex-adjusted regression analysis to compare health status outcomes in never and ever smokers. Altogether, 1,185 subjects (59%) returned the questionnaire. Mean age was 57 years (SD 13.5), and 58% were women; 38% were never smokers and 62% were ever smokers. Mean age at disease onset was 38.2 years (SD 13.2) and 41.2 years (SD 13.6), respectively (p = 0.001).

In this population-based PsA cohort, patients who were ever smokers reported worse health status than never smokers. Besides being a possible result of a worse PsA in ever smokers, impaired health status could also be an effect of unstudied comorbidities. Further longitudinal studies are needed to gain a better understanding of cause and effect.

25000963,10.1093/heapol/czu059,Crossing institutional boundaries: mapping the policy process for improved control of endemic and neglected zoonoses in sub-Saharan Africa.,"The recent adoption of the World Health Assembly Resolution 66.12 for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in May 2013 is an important turning point for advocacy regarding a number of endemic zoonotic infections, defined by the World Health Organization as the neglected zoonotic diseases (NZDs). In addition to NTD-listed zoonoses such as rabies, echinococcosis (hydatid disease), leishmaniasis, Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and Taenia solium cysticercosis, the NZDs also include important bacterial zoonoses such as anthrax, bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. To date, analysis of the processes that prioritize, develop and deliver zoonoses control programmes in many low- and middle-income countries is lacking, despite its potential to highlight significant evidence gaps and institutional constraints to the intersectoral approach required for their control. Policy process analysis was conducted via a series of semi-structured interviews with key policy actors within various ministries and institutes in Uganda and Nigeria. The study concluded that despite the rhetoric around 'linear' models of health policy development promoting consultation with a wide range of national stakeholders, the decision-making process for zoonotic disease control appears instead overtly influenced by the external political economy of trending pandemic threats, often overlooking national and regional zoonoses priorities. The inclusion of political systems remains a key factor in the zoonoses analysis matrix, enhancing our understanding of the intersectoral and transdisciplinary approaches required for their control. The authors consider policy process analysis to be a fundamental first step of any attempt to holistically strengthen human and animal health systems in a development context, particularly regarding the promotion of integrated control policies for regionally important zoonoses under the growing One Health movement.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

All patients underwent colonoscopy. We assessed Charlson comorbidity index scores and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, low-dose aspirin, other antiplatelet drugs, or warfarin. Rebleeding, the total number of rebleeding episodes, and mortality were measured. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs).--NEW SECTION--Rebleeding occurred in 84 patients, at a mean follow-up time of 19 months. The cumulative percentages of patients with rebleeding at 1 and 5 years were 19% and 46%, respectively. During the follow-up period, 29 patients (39%) had secondary rebleeding and 18 patients (62%) had subsequent rebleeding. Multivariate analysis showed age 65 years and older (HR, 1.7; P = .04) and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (HR, 2.0; P < .01) and nonaspirin antiplatelet drugs (HR, 1.8; P < .05) as independent risk factors for rebleeding. Dual therapy had a higher risk than single therapy (adjusted HR, 1.8; P < .05). During the mean follow-up period of 28 months, 21 patients died (2 from bleeding). Cumulative mortality rates at 1 and 5 years were 4.2% and 13%, respectively. Mortality was associated significantly with age ≥65 years (P < .05), Charlson comorbidity index score, and warfarin use.--NEW SECTION--Based on a retrospective analysis of patients with LGIB, 46% of all patients have rebleeding, and the overall mortality rate is 13% within 5 years after hospitalization. Besides age ≥65 years, use of antithrombotic drugs increases the risk of bleeding recurrence and mortality among patients with LGIB.",eng,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Mainstay of therapy is surgery including adequate staging and complete tumor resection, possibly inducing long-term side effects, especially in premenopausal women. The aim of this study was to evaluate quality of life (QoL) and sexual function in patients treated for BOT, also with respect to treatment modalities.--NEW SECTION--This prospective study was part of an ambidirectional multicentric cohort study in patients with BOT in Germany. Patients from seven centers completed three questionnaires after completion of therapy. QoL and sexual function data were correlated with treatment characteristics: surgical approach, lymphadenectomy, and fertility sparing surgery.--NEW SECTION--One hundred ten patients returned the questionnaires. Median follow-up was 4.0 years. The majority lived in a relationship (n = 85, 77%, missing n = 4), and 49% (n = 54, missing n = 6) were sexually active.

Food security, edible insects, and ""One World, One Health"" collaboration.","Scientists in the Netherlands are cultivating edible insects to address concerns of international food security. Committed to the One World, One Health (OWOH) movement, their research aims to create a safe and effective global solution to the conjoined problems of climate change and an increasing worldwide demand for protein. Their preliminary work is promising, as it suggests that when compared to other sources of meat, insects can be an efficient, safe, and low-impact source of nutrients. Additionally, in many sites with endemic malnutrition, people find insects tasty. The problem these scientists are grappling with, however, is that insects that are easily mass-produced are not the insects people typically want to eat. This paper shows how the contingency of edibility complicates existing scientific models of travel that posit that singular objects spread peripherally outwards from a center into a globally connected, singular world. The scientists are finding that the production of successful food products necessitates that insects be constantly tinkered with: there is no ""insect"" that can be globally edible since ""the global"" itself is not a singular entity. This in turn complicates the vision of replicability and ""scaling up"" inherent in an OWOH vision of science. The researchers' process of moving their goods from the laboratory boxes they work with into the mealtime practices they seek to impact is compelling them to cultivate and articulate new ideals for research, methods of translation, and pathways by which goods can travel.

Joint lobbying by national-level tobacco companies (that are foreign subsidiaries of multinationals) and local producers of other forms of tobacco blocked GHWLs for decades and delayed the implementation of effective GHWLs after they were mandated in 2007. Tobacco control activists used public interest lawsuits and the Right to Information Act to win government implementation of GHWLs on cigarette, bidi and smokeless tobacco packs in May 2009 and rotating GHWLs in December 2011.--NEW SECTION--GHWLs in India illustrate how the presence of bidis and cigarettes in the same market creates a complex regulatory environment. The government imposing tobacco control on multinational cigarette companies led to the enforcement of regulation on local forms of tobacco. As other developing countries with high rates of alternate forms of tobacco use establish and enforce GHWL laws, the tobacco control advocacy community can use pressure on the multinational cigarette industry as an indirect tool to force implementation of regulations on other forms of tobacco.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of COPD in Africa in the year 2010 to provide the information that could assist health policy in the region.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a systematic review of Medline, EMBASE and Global Health for studies on COPD published between 1990 and 2012. We included original population based studies providing estimates of the prevalence of COPD. We considered the reported estimates in terms of the mean age of the sample, sex ratio, the year of study and the country of the study as possible covariates. RESULTS from two different types of studies, i.e., based on spirometric and non-spirometric diagnosis of COPD, were further compared. The United Nation Population Division's population figures were used to estimate the number of COPD cases in the year 2010.--NEW SECTION--Our search returned 243 studies, from which only 13 met our selection criteria and only five were based on spirometry. The difference in the median prevalence of COPD in persons aged 40 years or older based on spirometry data (13.4%; IQR: 9.4%-22.1%) and non-spirometry data (4.0%; IQR: 2.1%-8.9%) was statistically significant (p = 0.001). There was no significant effect of the gender or the year of the study on the reported prevalence of COPD in either set of studies. The prevalence of COPD increased with age in spirometry-based studies (p = 0.017), which is a plausible finding suggesting internal consistency of spirometry-based estimates, while this trend was not observed in studies using other case definitions. When applied to the appropriate age group (40 years or more), which accounted for 196.4 million people in Africa in 2010, the estimated prevalence translates into 26.3 million (18.5-43.4 million) cases of COPD. Comparable figures for the year 2000 based on the same prevalence rates would amount to 20.0 million (14.1-33.1), suggesting an increase of 31.5% over a decade that is attributable to ageing of the African population alone.--NEW SECTION--Our findings suggest that COPD is likely to already represent a very large public health problem in Africa. Moreover, rapidly ageing African population should expect a steady increase in the number of COPD cases in the next decade and beyond. The quantity and quality of available evidence does not match the size of the problem. There is a need for more research on COPD prevalence, but also incidence, mortality and risk factors in Africa.

According to the ""UK Health Protection Agency Tuberculosis in the UK: 2012 Report,"" 8963 cases were reported in the United Kingdom in 2011. London had the greatest proportion of cases in the United Kingdom and the greatest rate of disease. TB affecting the foot is rare, affecting about 10% of all skeletal TB cases. However, owing to the current patterns of global immigration, with significant volumes of people migrating out of endemic countries, it has become a disease that physicians and surgeons in developed countries should be more aware of in today's practice. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first adult case of TB of the cuboid in the United Kingdom and the first adult case documented outside of India. We present the case details and the results of a thorough review of the literature. TB of the foot and ankle poses a diagnostic challenge because of the propensity of TB to mimic other pathologic entities radiologically. Tissue diagnosis and antitubercular medication is the mainstay of diagnosis and treatment, respectively.",eng,The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,Case Reports,2025-04-23,2015

Knowledge, perception of harm, and determinants of e-cigarettes use were assessed, while separate regression analyses among current (n=7352) and former cigarette smokers (n=5782) were performed. National estimates of the number of e-cigarette users were also extrapolated.--NEW SECTION--20.3% of current smokers, 4.7% of ex-smokers, and 1.2% of never cigarette smokers in the EU reported having ever used an e-cigarette (overall approximately 29.3 million adults). Among smokers, ever e-cigarette use was more likely among 15-24-year-olds (aOR 3.13, 95% CI 2.22 to 4.54) and 25-39-year-olds (aOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.78) in comparison to older smokers, and among those who smoked 6-10 cigarettes/day (aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.13) or 11-20 cigarettes/day (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.81) in comparison to very light smokers (≤5 cigarettes/day). Moreover, e-cigarette use was more likely among smokers who had made a past year quit attempt (aOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.58). E-cigarette use among ex-smokers was associated only with the respondents' age, with younger ex-smokers being more likely to have ever used an e-cigarette.--NEW SECTION--A substantial number of EU adults have ever used e-cigarettes. Ever users were more likely to be younger, current smokers, or past-year quit attempters. These findings underscore the need to evaluate the potential long term impact of e-cigarette use on consumer health, cessation and nicotine addiction and formulate a European framework for e-cigarette regulation within the revised EU Tobacco Product Directive.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The primary outcome was life expectancy at birth. Covariates of interest included sociodemographic and health indicators. To both establish and validate appropriate categorization of countries, a cluster analysis was undertaken to group cases by taking selected characteristics into account. A variance-component, multilevel mixed-effects linear model was employed that incorporated a finite, Almon, distributed lag of 5 years and bootstrapping with 5000 simulations to model the production function of life expectancy.--NEW SECTION--Results of the cluster analysis found four groupings. Clusters 1 and 2, composed of six total countries, generally represented non-industrialized/least developed countries. Clusters 3 and 4, totalling 15 nations, captured more industrialized nations. Overall, gross domestic product (GDP) (P = 0.011), vaccination averages (P = 0.026) and urbanization (P = 0.026), were significant positive predictors of life expectancy. No significant predictors existed for Cluster 1 countries. Among Cluster 2 nations, physician density (P = 0.014) and vaccination averages (P = 0.044) were significant positive predictors. GDP (P = 0.037) and literacy (P = 0.014) were positive significant predictors among Cluster 3 nations. GDP (P = 0.002), health expenditures (P = 0.002) and vaccination averages (P = 0.014) were positive significant predictors in Cluster 4 countries.--NEW SECTION--Predictors of life expectancy differed between non-industrialized and industrialized nations, with the exception of vaccination averages. Non-industrialized/least developed nations were associated with adjusted life expectancies of >14% lower than their industrialized peers.

Therefore, detection of microbial pathogens in food is the solution to the prevention and recognition of problems related to health and safety. Conventional and standard bacterial detection methods such as culture and colony counting methods and immunology-based methods may take up to several hours or even a few days to yield a result. Obviously, this is inadequate, and recently many researchers are focusing towards the progress of rapid diagnostic methods. The advent of molecular techniques has led to the development of a diverse array of assay for quality control of meat and meat products. Rapid analysis using DNA hybridization and amplification techniques offer more sensitivity and specificity to get results than culture based methods as well as dramatic reduction in the time to get results. Many methods have also achieved the high level automation, facilitating their application as routine sample screening assays.

A 63 year-old Caucasian man on metoprolol 200 mg/day for stable coronary artery disease was prescribed a 90-day course of oral terbinafine 250 mg/day for onychomycosis. On the 49th day of terbinafine therapy, he was brought to the emergency room for a decrease of his global health status, confusion and falls. The electrocardiogram revealed a 37 beats/min sinus bradycardia. A score of 7 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the patient's sinus bradycardia and the drug interaction between metoprolol and terbinafine. The heart rate ameliorated first with a decrease in the dose of metoprolol. It was subsequently changed to bisoprolol and the heart rate remained normal. By inhibiting the cytochrome P450 2D6, terbinafine had decreased metoprolol's clearance, leading in metoprolol accumulation which has resulted in clinically significant sinus bradycardia.",eng,European journal of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,Case Reports,2025-04-23,2015

A daily acupressure on HT7 point (H7 Insomnia Control(®)) was performed for a 8-week period. We administered the following scales: the mini mental state examination, the global deterioration scale, the neuropsychiatric inventory, the state-trait-anxiety inventory, the activity daily living and the instrumental activity daily living, the global health quality of life, and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index.--NEW SECTION--After receiving the acupressure treatment, patients saw a significant decrease of sleep disorders. The number of hours of effective sleep was perceived as increased. Furthermore, the time necessary to fall asleep decreased significantly and also the quality of sleep increased. Additionally, also the quality of life was bettered. Sedative drugs have been reduced in all patients involved in the study.--NEW SECTION--Acupressure can be recommended as a complementary, effective, and non-intrusive method to reduce sleep disturbances in old resident patients affected by cognitive disorders.

To enable timely supportive care, these symptoms must be assessed adequately with reliable tools.--NEW SECTION--This study aimed to validate the German version of the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).--NEW SECTION--This was a multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study. At five German university hospitals, 697 cancer patients aged from 18 to 80 years undergoing active anticancer treatment were recruited to participate in the study. For the validation, reliability (Cronbach's alpha), construct validity (factor analysis), known group validity (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status), and convergent divergent analyses were calculated.--NEW SECTION--Of the 980 patients who were eligible, 697 patients were included and agreed to participate in the study (71%). Reliability analysis showed good internal consistencies for the MDASI set of symptoms (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.78, 0.84) and for the set of interference items (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.857; 95% CI = 0.484, 0.87). Factor analysis resulted in a one-factor solution (general symptoms; eigenvalue = 4.26) with a psychological (distress and sadness) and a gastrointestinal subscale (nausea and vomiting). Convergent and divergent analyses showed significant correlations between symptom burden and distress and global health-related quality of life (subscale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 Version 3.0.).--NEW SECTION--The MDASI-German version is a valid tool for measuring patient-reported symptom severity and symptom interference in German cancer patients.

Typhimurium.,"Salmonella infection, ranging from mild, self-limiting diarrhea to severe gastrointestinal, septicemic disease and enteric fever, is a global health problem both in humans and animals. Rapid development of microbial drug resistance has led to a need for efficacious and affordable vaccines against Salmonella. Microbial heat shock proteins (HSPs), including HSP60 and HSP70, are the dominant antigens that promote the host immune response. Co-administration of these antigens with cytokines, such as IL-22, which plays an important role in antimicrobial defense, can enhance the immune response and protection against pathogens. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the immunogenicity of rGroEL (Hsp60) of S. Typhi, alone or administered in combination with murine rIL-22, and its protective efficacy against lethal infection with Salmonella, in mice. There was appreciable stimulation of the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice immunized with rGroEL alone. However, co-administration of rGroEL with rIL-22 further boosted the antibody titers (IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a), T-cell proliferative responses and the secretion of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Additionally, rGroEL alone accorded 65%-70% protection against lethal challenge with S. Typhi and S.

However, evidence for this relationship has not been systematically reviewed. This review of empirical studies aims to: (1) synthesise the evidence linking women's empowerment and child nutritional status in South Asia and (2) suggest directions for future research. We systematically searched Global Health, Embase (classic and Ovid), MEDLINE, Campbell Collaboration, Popline, Eldis, Web of Science, EconLit and Scopus. We generated 1661 studies for abstract and title screening. We full-text screened 44 of these, plus 10 additional studies the authors were aware of. Only 12 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We included English materials published between 1990 and 2012 that examined the relationship(s) of at least one women's empowerment domain and nutritional status among South Asian children. Data were extracted and synthesised within three domains of empowerment: control of resources and autonomy, workload and time, and social support. The results showed women's empowerment to be generally associated with child anthropometry, but the findings are mixed. Inter-study differences in population characteristics, settings or methods/conceptualisations of women's empowerment, and the specific domains studied, likely contributed to these inconsistencies. This review also highlights that different women's empowerment domains may relate differently to child nutritional status. Future research should aim to harmonise definitions of women's empowerment, which key domains it should include, and how it is measured. Rigorous evaluation work is also needed to establish which policies and programmes facilitate women's empowerment and in turn, foster child nutritional well-being.",eng,Maternal & child nutrition,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

In the North American context, much has been written about blood and tissue donation patterns among different religious and cultural groups within the United States. However, there are few available statistics or descriptive research that discusses blood donation decisions among Aboriginal Canadians. In 2001, Aboriginal Canadians represented approximately 4.1% of the total Canadian population, or 1.1 million persons (Birn et al., in Textbook of international health: global health in a dynamic world. Oxford University Press, New York, NY, 2009). Comparatively, Canada Blood Services reports that Aboriginal Canadians represent only 0.9% of registered donors (Canadian Blood Services 2011a). These low donation patterns suggest that blood donation choice among Aboriginal Canadians requires better understanding. This paper discusses several factors that may influence Aboriginal health choices, specifically those associated with blood donation decision-making. Several influential factors will be discussed, including: the meaning of the body and its parts in relationship to the interconnectedness of all things (religio-cultural), the reflexivity of choice and control (political), and relationships with others (social).",eng,Journal of religion and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The goal of this study was to examine the prevalence of and factors associated with this smoking-induced deprivation among adult smokers in China.--NEW SECTION--The data came from Waves 1-3 of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) China Survey, conducted from 2006 to 2009 among urban adults aged 18 years or older in China. We focus on the samples of current smokers from six cities (N=7981). Smoking-induced deprivation was measured with the survey question, ""In the last six months, have you spent money on cigarettes that you knew would be better spent on household essentials like food?"" We examined whether sociodemographic factors, smoking intensity and price paid per pack of cigarettes were associated with smoking-induced deprivation using generalised estimating equations modelling.--NEW SECTION--7.3% of smokers reported smoking-induced deprivation due to purchasing cigarettes. Low-income and middle-income smokers were more likely to have smoking-induced deprivation compared with high-income smokers (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.06, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.31; AOR=1.44, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.69); smokers living in Shenyang (AOR=1.68, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.24) and Yinchuan (AOR=2.50, 95% CI 1.89 to 3.32) were more likely to have smoking-induced deprivation compared with smokers living in Beijing. Retired smokers were less likely to have smoking-induced deprivation compared with employed smokers (AOR=0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.87). There was no statistically significant relationship between smoking intensity, price paid per pack of cigarettes and smoking-induced deprivation.--NEW SECTION--Our findings indicate that certain groups of smokers in China acknowledge spending money on cigarettes that could be better spent on household essentials.

In addition to facing high mortality rates, the survivors of acute kidney injury are at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is the most common cause of acute kidney injury, and results from impaired delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the kidney. Massive leukocyte influx into the post-ischemic kidney is one of the hallmarks of IRI. The recruited leukocytes exacerbate tissue damage and, if uncontrolled, initiate the progressive changes that lead to renal fibrosis and chronic kidney disease. Early on, recruitment and activation of platelets promotes microthrombosis in the injured kidney, further exacerbating kidney damage. The diversity, complexity, and multiplicity of pathways involved in leukocyte recruitment and platelet activation make it extremely challenging to control these processes, and past efforts have met with limited success in human trials. A generalized strategy to inhibit infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes and platelets, thereby reducing inflammation and injury, may prove to be more beneficial. In this review, we summarize recent findings demonstrating that the neuronal guidance cues, Slit and Roundabout (Robo), prevent the migration of multiple leukocyte subsets towards diverse inflammatory chemoattractants, and have potent anti-platelet functions in vitro and in vivo. These properties uniquely position Slit2 as a novel therapeutic that could be used to prevent acute kidney injury associated with IRI.",eng,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

It is now is the fourth leading cause of death and the primary cause of adult disability in the United States. Substantial evidence from both experimental and clinical studies has demonstrated that social isolation (SI) can increase stroke incidence and impair recovery. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that an increasing number of patients are living alone, and as the aging population increases, loneliness will only increase in prevalence. SI is increasingly identified as an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality. In contrast, individuals with high levels of social support exhibit more rapid and extensive functional and cognitive recovery after a wide variety of pathological insults, including stroke. Clinical data suggests that SI is an important risk factor for increased mortality and delayed functional recovery following ischemic stroke. Attesting to the importance of mortality and behavioral factors in stroke outcome is that these same effects can be reproduced in animal models of experimental stroke. This has allowed researchers to identify several mechanistic changes that occur with affiliative interactions. These include decreased systemic inflammation, elaboration of growth factors including brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), enhanced neurogenesis, and improved neuroimmune responsiveness in group housed animals. These may mediate the beneficial effects of social interaction on improving stroke recovery and reducing neuronal death.

BCTs were classified according to the CALO-RE taxonomy.--NEW SECTION--Data were synthesized by cross-tabulation of BCTs with study outcomes.--NEW SECTION--Fifteen of 16 eligible studies reported a positive intervention effect in at least one outcome. Nine studies (56%) did not define health coaching; the number of intervention sessions provided ranged from 2 to 48; and in three studies, one or more intervention details were unclear. It was hence difficult to synthesize the studies to adequately address our research questions.--NEW SECTION--Health coaching is a promising strategy for health improvements; however, future research should ensure clarity in reporting intervention details, clearer definitions of health coaching/theoretical bases, consistency in reporting BCTs, and the inclusion of process variables as outcome measures.",eng,American journal of health promotion : AJHP,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015
24638966,10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051364,A review of smoking policies in airports around the world.,"To review smoking policies of major international airports, to compare these policies with corresponding incountry tobacco control legislation and to identify areas of improvement for advancing smoke-free policy in airports.--NEW SECTION--We reviewed smoking policies of 34 major international airports in five world regions, and collected data on current national and subnational legislation on smoke-free indoor places in the corresponding airport locations. We then compared airport smoking policies with local legislation. Additionally, we collected anecdotal information concerning smoking rules and practices in specific airports from an online traveller website.--NEW SECTION--We found that 52.9% of the airports reviewed had indoor smoking rooms or smoking areas; smoking policy was unknown or unstated for two airports. 55.9% of the airports were located in countries where national legislation allowed designated smoking rooms and areas, while 35.3% were in smoke-free countries. Subnational legislation restricted smoking in 60% of the airport locations, while 40% were smoke-free. 71.4% of the airport locations had subnational legislation that allowed smoke-free laws to be more stringent than at the national level, but only half of these places had enacted such laws.--NEW SECTION--Despite the increasing presence of smoke-free places and legal capacity to enact stricter legislation at the local level, airports represent a public and occupational space that is often overlooked in national or subnational smoke-free policies. Secondhand smoke exposure in airports can be reduced among travellers and workers by implementing and enforcing smoke-free policies in airports. Additionally, existing information on smoke-free legislation lacks consistent terminology and definitions, which are needed to inform future tobacco control policy within airports and in the law.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

24444512,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.12.108,Understanding the translation of scientific knowledge about arsenic risk exposure among private well water users in Nova Scotia.,"Arsenic is a class I human carcinogen that has been identified as the second most important global health concern in groundwater supplies after contamination by pathogenic organisms. Hydrogeological assessments have shown naturally occurring arsenic to be widespread in groundwater across the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. Knowledge of arsenic risk exposure among private well users in these arsenic endemic areas has not yet been fully explored but research on water quality perceptions indicates a consistent misalignment between public and scientific assessments of environmental risk. This paper evaluates knowledge of arsenic risk exposure among a demographic cross-section of well users residing in 5 areas of Nova Scotia assessed to be at variable risk (high-low) of arsenic occurrence in groundwater based on water sample analysis. An integrated knowledge-to-action (KTA) methodological approach is utilized to comprehensively assess the personal, social and local factors shaping perception of well water contaminant risks and the translation of knowledge into routine water testing behaviors. Analysis of well user survey data (n=420) reveals a high level of confidence in well water quality that is unrelated to the relative risk of arsenic exposure or homeowner adherence to government testing recommendations. Further analysis from the survey and in-depth well user interviews (n=32) finds that well users' assessments of risk are influenced by personal experience, local knowledge, social networks and convenience of infrastructure rather than by formal information channels, which are largely failing to reach their target audiences. Insights from interviews with stakeholders representing government health and environment agencies (n=15) are used to reflect on the institutional barriers that mediate the translation of scientific knowledge into public awareness and stewardship behaviors. The utilization of local knowledge brokers, community-based networks and regulatory incentives to improve risk knowledge and support routine testing among private well users is discussed.",eng,The Science of the total environment,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Patients non-responsive or intolerant to a single TNFi were enrolled ≤4 weeks after starting rituximab or a second TNFi. Primary end point: change in Disease Activity Score in 28 joints excluding patient's global health component (DAS28-3)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) over 6 months.--NEW SECTION--604 patients received rituximab, and 507 an alternative TNFi as second biological therapy. Reasons for discontinuing the first TNFi were inefficacy (n=827), intolerance (n=263) and other (n=21). A total of 728 patients were available for primary end point analysis (rituximab n=405; TNFi n=323). Baseline mean (SD) DAS28-3-ESR was higher in the rituximab than the TNFi group: 5.2 (1.2) vs 4.8 (1.3); p<0.0001. Least squares mean (SE) change in DAS28-3-ESR at 6 months was significantly greater in rituximab than TNFi patients: -1.5 (0.2) vs -1.1 (0.2); p=0.007. The difference remained significant among patients discontinuing the initial TNFi because of inefficacy (-1.7 vs -1.3; p=0.017) but not intolerance (-0.7 vs -0.7; p=0.894). Seropositive patients showed significantly greater improvements in DAS28-3-ESR with rituximab than with TNFi (-1.6 (0.3) vs -1.2 (0.3); p=0.011), particularly those switching because of inefficacy (-1.9 (0.3) vs -1.5 (0.4); p=0.021). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar between the rituximab and TNFi groups.--NEW SECTION--These real-life data indicate that, after discontinuation of an initial TNFi, switching to rituximab is associated with significantly improved clinical effectiveness compared with switching to a second TNFi. This difference was particularly evident in seropositive patients and in those switched because of inefficacy.",eng,Annals of the rheumatic diseases,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2015
24373050,10.1111/dewb.12034,Cultural conundrums: the ethics of epidemiology and the problems of population in implementing pre-exposure prophylaxis.,"The impending implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has prompted complicated bioethical and public health ethics concerns regarding the moral distribution of antiretroviral medications (ARVs) to ostensibly healthy populations as a form of HIV prevention when millions of HIV-positive people still lack access to ARVs globally. This manuscript argues that these questions are, in part, concerns over the ethics of the knowledge production practices of epidemiology. Questions of distribution, and their attendant cost-benefit calculations, will rely on a number of presupposed, and therefore, normatively cultural assumptions within the science of epidemiology specifically regarding the ability of epidemiologic surveillance to produce accurate maps of HIV throughout national populations. Specifically, ethical questions around PrEP will focus on who should receive ARVs given the fact that global demand will far exceed supply. Given that sexual transmission is one of the main modes of HIV transmission, these questions of 'who' are inextricably linked to knowledge about sexual personhood. As a result, the ethics of epidemiology, and how the epidemiology of HIV in particular conceives, classifies and constructs sexual populations will become a critical point of reflection and contestation for bioethicists, health activists, physicians, nurses, and researchers in the multi-disciplinary field of global health. This paper examines how cultural conundrums within the fields of bioethics and public health ethics are directly implicated within the ethics of PrEP, by analyzing the problems of population inaugurated by the construction of the men who have sex with men (MSM) epidemiologic category in the specific national context of South Africa.",eng,Developing world bioethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

With the majority of deaths from the tobacco epidemic occurring in LMICs, new media must be harnessed both as an advocacy tool to promote social mobilisation around tobacco issues and to build public support for MPOWER policies. This paper examines three consecutive new media advocacy campaigns that used communication channels such as mobile SMS, Facebook and online advertising to promote tobacco control policies. It includes some of the lessons learned, such as the pitfalls of relying on viral growth as a strategy for obtaining reach and campaign growth; the challenge of translating strategies from traditional media to new media; and the importance of incorporating marketing strategies such as paid advertising, community organising or public relations. It also identifies some of the many knowledge gaps and proposes future research directions.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

The Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) and the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) are the most frequently used in cost-effect analyses in national and global health policy discussions for allocation of health care resources. While sometimes useful, both the DALY and QALY metrics have limitations in their ability to capture the full health impact of helminth infections and other 'neglected tropical diseases' (NTDs). Gaps in current knowledge of disease burden are identified, and interim approaches to disease burden assessment are discussed.",eng,Acta tropica,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

However, few studies have been conducted to explore the effects of nursing unit structure on medication errors. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the effects of structural factors on medication errors in nursing units. A total of 977 staff nurses and 62 head nurses participated in this cross-sectional design study. The findings show that professional autonomy (β = .53, t = 6.03, p < .01), technology (β = .25, t = 3.02, p < .01), and nursing experts (β = .52, t = 5.99, p < .01) are predictors of medication error rates. This study shows that the structural factors influence medication administration and the mechanistic approach is specifically in relation of low medication error rates. The author suggests that head nurses should consider strategies that require adjustments to unit control mechanisms.",eng,Western journal of nursing research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2015

Articles focusing solely on interventions designed to stimulate cessation were excluded, as were articles focusing solely on assisted cessation, leaving articles reporting on smokers who quit unassisted. Data from articles reporting on unassisted cessation were extracted and grouped into related categories.--NEW SECTION--A total of 248 articles reported on smoking cessation, of which 63 focused solely on interventions designed to stimulate cessation, leaving 185 reporting on the method of cessation ('how' a smoker quits). Of these, 166 focused solely on assisted cessation, leaving 19 reporting, either directly or indirectly, on smokers who quit unassisted. Data from these studies indicated 54% to 69% of ex-smokers quit unassisted and 41% to 58% of current smokers had attempted to quit unassisted.--NEW SECTION--The majority of Australian smokers quit or attempt to quit unassisted, yet little research has been dedicated to understanding this process. Almost all research that reported unassisted cessation referenced it as a comparator to the focal point of assisted cessation.

Field geographic information systems data were obtained for all tobacco vendors and advertisements within 500 m of schools (n=26). Random-effects multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate associations of tobacco vendor and advertisement densities with ever tobacco use, current smokeless tobacco use and current tobacco use.--NEW SECTION--There were 1741 tobacco vendors and 424 advertisements within 500 m of schools, with 221 vendors (13%) and 42 advertisements (10%) located within 100 m. School-adjacent tobacco vendor density within 100 m was not associated with the tobacco use outcomes, but tobacco advertisement density within 100 m was associated with all outcomes when comparing highest to lowest density tertiles: ever use (OR: 2.01; 95% CI 1.00 to 4.07), current use (2.23; 1.16, 4.28) and current smokeless tobacco use (2.01; 1.02, 3.98).
