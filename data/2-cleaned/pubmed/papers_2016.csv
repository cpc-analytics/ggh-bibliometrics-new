29731808,10.1093/phe/phw021,Global Health Solidarity.,"For much of the 20th century, vulnerability to deprivations of health has often been defined by geographical and economic factors. Those in wealthy, usually 'Northern' and 'Western', parts of the world have benefited from infrastructures, and accidents of geography and climate, which insulate them from many serious threats to health. Conversely, poorer people are typically exposed to more threats to health, and have lesser access to the infrastructures needed to safeguard them against the worst consequences of such exposure. However, in recent years the increasingly globalized nature of the world's economy, society and culture, combined with anthropogenic climate change and the evolution of antibiotic resistance, has begun to shift the boundaries that previously defined the categories of person threatened by many exogenous threats to health. In doing so, these factors expose both new and forgotten similarities between persons, and highlight the need for global cooperative responses to the existential threats posed by climate change and the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. In this article, we argue that these emerging health threats, in demonstrating the similarities that exist between even distant persons, provides a catalyst for global solidarity, which justifies, and provides motivation for, the establishment of solidaristic, cooperative global health infrastructures.",eng,Public health ethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

The overall mean difference in screen time outcomes between groups was -17.12 (95% CI -28.82 to -5.42) min/day with a significant overall intervention effect (Z=2.87, p=0.004). The overall mean difference in sedentary time between groups was -18.91 (95% CI -33.31 to -4.51) min/day with a significant overall intervention effect (Z=2.57, p=0.01). Subgroup analyses suggest that for screen time, interventions of ≥6 months duration and those conducted in a community-based setting are most effective. For sedentary time, interventions targeting physical activity (and reporting changes in sedentary time) are more effective than those directly targeting sedentary time.--NEW SECTION--Despite heterogeneity in study methods and results, overall interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in early childhood show significant reductions, suggesting that this may be an opportune time to intervene.--NEW SECTION--CRD42015017090.",eng,British journal of sports medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2018
29263856,10.1038/npjvaccines.2016.17,An efficient cell free enzyme-based total synthesis of a meningococcal vaccine candidate.,"Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a global health problem and vaccination has proven the most effective way of disease control. Neisseria meningitidis serogroup X (NmX) is an emerging threat in the African sub-Saharan meningitis belt, but no vaccine is available today. Leading vaccines against Nm are glycoconjugates, in which capsular polysaccharides isolated from large-scale pathogen cultures are conjugated to adjuvant proteins. Though safe and efficacious even in infants, high costs and biohazard associated with the production limit abundant application of glycoconjugate vaccines particularly in the most afflicted nations. An existing NmX vaccine candidate (CPSXn-CRM197) produced by established protocols from NmX capsule polysaccharide (CPSX) has been shown to elicit high bactericidal immunoglobulin G titres in mice. Here we describe the scalable in vitro synthesis of CPSXiv from chemically pure precursors by the use of recombinant NmX capsule polymerase. Application of the described coupling chemistry gives CPSXiv-CRM197, which in mouse vaccination experiments behaves identical to the benchmark CPSXn-CRM197. Excluding any biohazards, this novel process represents a paradigm shift in vaccine production and a premise towards vaccine manufacturing in emerging economies.",eng,NPJ vaccines,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

29244989,10.1200/JGO.2016.005587,Global Use of Traditional and Complementary Medicine in Childhood Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"Purpose Traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) strategies are commonly used in pediatric oncology. Patterns may vary based on country income. We systematically reviewed published studies describing T&CM use among pediatric oncology patients in low-income countries (LIC/LMIC), middle-income countries (UMIC), and high-income countries (HIC). Objectives included describing estimated prevalence of use, reasons for use, perceived effectiveness, modalities used, rates of disclosure, and reporting of delayed or abandoned treatment. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ProceedingsFirst were searched. Inclusion criteria were primary studies involving children younger than the age of 18 years, undergoing active treatment of cancer, and any T&CM use. Exclusion criteria included no pediatric oncology-specific outcomes and studies involving only children off active treatment. Data were extracted by two reviewers using a systematic data extraction form determined a priori. Results Sixty-five studies published between 1977 and 2015 were included, representing 61 unique data sets and 7,219 children from 34 countries. The prevalence of T&CM use ranged from 6% to 100%. Median rates of use were significantly different in LIC/LMIC (66.7% ± 19%), UMIC (60% ± 26%), and HIC (47.2% ± 20%; P = .02). Rates of disclosure differed significantly by country income, with higher median rates in HIC. Seven studies reported on treatment abandonment or delays. Conclusion The use of T&CM in pediatric oncology is common worldwide, with higher median prevalence of use reported in LIC/LMIC. Further research is warranted to examine the impact on treatment abandonment and delay.",eng,Journal of global oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017
29202068,10.1186/s41256-016-0020-9,Developing an approach to assessing the political feasibility of global collective action and an international agreement on antimicrobial resistance.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global issue. International trade, travel, agricultural practices, and environmental contamination all make it possible for resistant microbes to cross national borders. Global collective action is needed in the form of an international agreement or other mechanism that brings states together at the negotiation table and commits them to adopt or implement policies to limit the spread of resistant microorganisms. This article describes an approach to assessing whether political and stakeholder interests can align to commit to tackling AMR.--NEW SECTION--Two dimensions affecting political feasibility were selected and compared across 82 countries: 1) states' global influence and 2) self-interest in addressing AMR. World Bank GDP ranking was used as a proxy for global influence, while human antibiotic consumption (10-year percent change) was used as a proxy for self-interest in addressing AMR. We used these data to outline a typology of four country archetypes, and discuss how these archetypes can be used to understand whether a proposed agreement may have sufficient support to be politically feasible.--NEW SECTION--Four types of countries exist within our proposed typology: 1) wealthy countries who have the expertise and financial resources to push for global collective action on AMR, 2) wealthy countries who need to act on AMR, 3) countries who require external assistance to act on AMR, and 4) neutral countries who may support action where applicable. Any international agreement will require substantial support from countries of the first type to lead global action, and from countries of the second type who have large increasing antimicrobial consumption levels. A large number of barriers exist that could derail efforts towards global collective action on AMR; issues of capacity, infrastructure, regulation, and stakeholder interests will need to be addressed in coordination with other actors to achieve an agreement on AMR.--NEW SECTION--Achieving a global agreement on access, conservation, and innovation - the three pillars of AMR - will not be easy. However, smaller core groups of interested Initiator and Pivotal Countries could develop policy and resolve many issues. If highly influential countries take the lead, agreements could then be scaled up to achieve global action.",eng,Global health research and policy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
29195892,10.1016/j.foodres.2016.10.015,A consumer-based approach to salt reduction: Case study with bread.,"In recent years high sodium intake has raised growing concern worldwide. A widespread reduction of salt concentration in processed foods has been claimed as one of the most effective strategies to achieve a short-term impact on global health. However, one of the major challenges in reducing salt in food products is its potential negative impact on consumer perception. For this reason, gradual salt reduction has been recommended. In this context, the aim of the present work was to present a consumer-based approach to salt reduction, using bread as case study. Two consumer studies with a total of 303 consumers were carried out. In the first study, four sequential difference thresholds were determined through paired-comparison tests, starting at a salt concentration of 2%. In the second study, 99 consumers performed a two-bite evaluation of their sensory and hedonic perception of five bread samples: a control bread containing 2% salt and four samples with reduced salt content according to the difference thresholds determined in the first study. Survival analysis was used to determine average difference thresholds, which ranged from 9.4% to 14.3% of the salt concentration of the control bread. Results showed that salt concentration significantly influenced consumer overall liking of the bread samples. However, large heterogeneity was found in consumer hedonic reaction towards salt reduction: two groups of consumers with different preference and hedonic sensitivity to salt reduction were found. Results from the present work confirm that cumulative series of small salt reductions may be a feasible strategy for reducing the sodium content of bread without affecting consumer hedonic perception and stress the importance of considering consumer perception in the design of gradual salt reduction programmes.",eng,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

28952584,10.3390/bioengineering3040021,Optimal Signal Quality Index for Photoplethysmogram Signals.,"A photoplethysmogram (PPG) is a noninvasive circulatory signal related to the pulsatile volume of blood in tissue and is typically collected by pulse oximeters. PPG signals collected via mobile devices are prone to artifacts that negatively impact measurement accuracy, which can lead to a significant number of misleading diagnoses. Given the rapidly increased use of mobile devices to collect PPG signals, developing an optimal signal quality index (SQI) is essential to classify the signal quality from these devices. Eight SQIs were developed and tested based on: perfusion, kurtosis, skewness, relative power, non-stationarity, zero crossing, entropy, and the matching of systolic wave detectors. Two independent annotators annotated all PPG data (106 recordings, 60 s each) and a third expert conducted the adjudication of differences. The independent annotators labeled each PPG signal with one of the following labels: excellent, acceptable or unfit for diagnosis. All indices were compared using Mahalanobis distance, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation. The skewness index outperformed the other seven indices in differentiating between excellent PPG and acceptable, acceptable combined with unfit, and unfit recordings, with overall F 1 scores of 86.0%, 87.2%, and 79.1%, respectively.",eng,"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In this article, I track the role of corporations in the construction of the obesity epidemic, deemed one of the major public health threats of the century. Focusing on China, a rising superpower in the midst of rampant, state-directed neoliberalization, I unravel the process, mechanisms, and broad effects of the corporate invention of an obesity epidemic. Largely hidden from view, Western firms were central actors at every stage in the creation, definition, and governmental management of obesity as a Chinese disease. Two industry-funded global health entities and the exploitation of personal ties enabled actors to nudge the development of obesity science and policy along lines beneficial to large firms, while obscuring the nudging. From Big Pharma to Big Food and Big Soda, transnational companies have been profiting from the 'epidemic of Chinese obesity', while doing little to effectively treat or prevent it. The China case suggests how obesity might have been constituted an 'epidemic threat' in other parts of the world and underscores the need for global frameworks to guide the study of neoliberal science and policymaking.",eng,Social studies of science,Historical Article,2025-04-23,2016

Herbal medicines account for 16.8% of patients with chronic liver disease who use complementary and alternative therapies. A survey of the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan reported that Long-Dan-Xie-Gan-Tang, Jia-Wei-Xia-Yao-San, and Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang (Sho-saiko-to) were the most frequent formula prescriptions for chronic hepatitis used by traditional Chinese medicine physicians. Bioanalytical methods of herbal medicines for the treatment of chronic hepatitis were developed to investigate pharmacokinetics properties, but multicomponent herbal formulas have been seldom discussed. The pharmacokinetics of herbal formulas is closely related to efficacy, efficiency, and patient safety of traditional herbal medicines. Potential herbal formula-drug interactions are another essential issue during herbal formula administration in chronic hepatitis patients. In a survey with the PubMed database, this review article evaluates the existing evidence-based data associated with the documented pharmacokinetics profiles and potential herbal-drug interactions of herbal formulas for the treatment of chronic hepatitis. In addition, the existing pharmacokinetic profiles were further linked with clinical practice to provide insight for the safety and specific use of traditional herbal medicines.",eng,Journal of food and drug analysis,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

28879135,10.4102/ajlm.v5i2.560,The WHO AFRO external quality assessment programme (EQAP): Linking laboratory networks through EQA programmes.,"External Quality Assessment (EQA) surveys performed by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) revealed the need for the strengthening of public health microbiology laboratories, particularly for testing of epidemic-prone diseases in the African Region. These surveys revealed common issues such as supply chain management, skilled personnel, logistical support and overall lack of quality standards. For sustainable improvements to health systems as well as global health security, deficiencies identified need to be actively corrected through robust quality assurance programmes and implementation of laboratory quality management systems. Given all the pathogens of public health importance, an external quality assessment programme with a focus on vaccine-preventable diseases and emerging and re-emerging dangerous pathogens is important, and should not be stand-alone, but integrated within laboratory networks as seen in polio, measles, yellow fever and rubella. In 2015, WHO AFRO collaborated with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and partners in a series of consultations with countries and national and regional EQA providers for the development of quality assurance models to support HIV point-of-care testing and monitoring. These consultations revealed similar challenges as seen in the WHO AFRO surveys. WHO AFRO brought forth its experience in implementing quality standards for health programmes, and also opened discussions on how lessons learned through such established programmes can be utilised to supporting and strengthening the introduction of early infant diagnosis of HIV and viral load point-of-care testing. An optimised external quality assessment programme will impact the ability of countries to meet core capacities, providing improved quality management systems, improving the confidence of diagnostic network services in Africa, and including capacities to detect events of international public health importance.",eng,African journal of laboratory medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Accurate determination of CD4+ T-cells in patient samples relies on reliable CD4 enumeration. The Quality Assessment and Standardization programme for Immunological measures relevant to HIV/AIDS (QASI) programme of the Public Health Agency of Canada provides clinical laboratories from resource-limited countries with a mechanism to evaluate the quality of CD4 testing and develop the implementation of an independent national External Quality Assessment (EQA) programme. This study describes how QASI helped develop the capacity for managing a sustainable national CD4 EQA programme in India.--NEW SECTION--Supported by the Public Health Agency of Canada and Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative, QASI engaged with the National AIDS Control Organization and the Indian National AIDS Research Institute to assist in technology transfer in preparation for the implementation/management of an independent CD4 EQA programme. Technology transfer training was provided to support corrective actions and to improve the quality of CD4 testing. Inter-laboratory variation of EQA surveys between pre- and post-skill development was compared.--NEW SECTION--Prior to training, coefficient of variation values were 14.7% (mid-level CD4 count controls) and 39.0% (low-level). Following training, variation was reduced to 10.3% for mid-level controls and 20.0% for low-level controls.--NEW SECTION--This training assisted the National AIDS Control Organization and the Indian National AIDS Research Institute in identifying the information necessary for management of an EQA programme, and developed the foundation for India to provide corrective actions for sites with challenges in achieving reliable results for CD4 enumeration. This led to a demonstrable improvement in CD4 testing quality and illustrates how country-specific training significantly improved CD4 enumeration performance for better clinical management of HIV care in India.",eng,African journal of laboratory medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
28855808,10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.10.013,Protective effect of some plant oils on diazinon induced hepatorenal toxicity in male rats.,"Environmental pollution and exposure to environmental pollutants are still some of the major global health issues. Pesticides have been linked to a wide range of health hazards. The toxicity of pesticides depends on several factors such as its chemical properties, doses, exposure period, exposure methods, gender, genetics, age, nutritional status and physiological case of exposed individuals. Medicinal plants, natural products and nutrition continue to play a central role in the healthcare system of large proportions of the world's population. Alternative medicine plays an important role in health services around the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of olive, sesame and black seed oils on hepatorenal toxicity induced by diazinon (DZN) in male rats. The experimental animals were divided into nine groups. The first group served as control. The second group was exposed to DZN. The third group was treated with olive oil and DZN. Rats of the fourth group were subjected to sesame oil and DZN. Rats of the fifth group were exposed to black seed oil and DZN. The sixth, seventh and eighth groups were supplemented with olive, sesame and black seed oils respectively. Rats of the ninth group were treated with corn oil. Levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase, total bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and malondialdehyde were significantly increased in rats exposed to DZN. Moreover, levels of serum glutathione and superoxide dismutase were significantly decreased. Several histopathological changes were observed in the structures of liver and kidney due to DZN exposure. This study showed that these oils attenuated the physiological disturbances and histopathological alterations induced by DZN intoxication. Moreover, the antioxidant properties of these oils support the bioactive roles of its protective effects on DZN toxicity. This study therefore suggests that these oils could be used as preventive factors against the toxicity of DZN due to its antioxidant properties.",eng,Saudi journal of biological sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Cost effectiveness in healthcare is the minimal amount spent to obtain acceptable outcomes. Studies on manual therapies often fail to identify which manual therapy intervention or combinations with other interventions is the most cost effective. The purpose of this commentary is to sample the dialogue within the literature on the cost effectiveness of evidence-based manual therapies with a particular focus on the neck and low back regions.--NEW SECTION--This commentary identifies and presents the available literature on the cost effectiveness of manual therapies for NLBP. Key words searched were neck and low back pain, cost effectiveness, and manual therapy to select evidence-based articles. Eight articles were identified and presented for discussion.--NEW SECTION--The lack of homogeneity, in the available literature, makes difficult any valid comparison among the various cost effectiveness studies.--NEW SECTION--Potential outcome bias in each study is dependent upon the lens through which it is evaluated. If evaluated from a societal perspective, the conclusion slants toward ""adequate"" interventions in an effort to decrease costs rather than toward the most efficacious interventions with the best outcomes. When cost data are assessed according to a healthcare (or individual) perspective, greater value is placed on quality of life, the patient's beliefs, and the ""willingness to pay.""",eng,Journal of bodywork and movement therapies,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Zoo and public health professionals working together within a One Health framework represent a powerful alliance to address current and future conservation and public health problems around the world. For researchers, practitioners, and students, the collaboration between zoos and public health institutions offers the opportunity to both teach and operationalize this transdisciplinary approach. Using examples from our programs, we give a template for moving forward with collaborative initiatives and sustainable solutions involving partners in both zoos and public health institutions. We provide examples of cooperative programs and suggest a model for consideration in the development of further activities in this area.",eng,"One health (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

The recent Global Action Plan on antimicrobial resistance highlights the importance of adopting One Health approaches that can cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. We report on the early experiences of a multisectoral Sino-Swedish research project that aims to address gaps in our current knowledge and seeks to improve the situation through system-wide interventions. Our research project is investigating antibiotic use and resistance in a rural area of China through a combination of epidemiological, health systems and laboratory investigations. We reflect here on the challenges inherent in conducting long distance cross-disciplinary collaborations, having now completed data and sample collection for a baseline situation analysis. In particular, we recognise the importance of investing in aspects such as effective communication, shared conceptual frameworks and leadership. We suggest that our experiences will be instructive to others planning to develop similar international One Health collaborations.",eng,"One health (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
28596813,NA,Three Eras in Global Tobacco Control: How Global Governance Processes Influenced Online Tobacco Control Networking.,"Online networks can serve as a platform to diffuse policy innovations and enhance global health governance. This study focuses on how shifts in global health governance may influence related online networks. We compare social network metrics (average degree centrality [AVGD], density [D] and clustering coefficient [CC]) of Globalink, an online network of tobacco control advocates, across three eras in global tobacco control governance; pre-Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) policy transfer (1992-1998), global regime formation through the FCTC negotiations (1999-2005), and philanthropic funding through the Bloomberg Initiative (2006-2012). Prior to 1999, Globalink was driven by a handful of high-income countries (AVGD=1.908 D=0.030, CC=0.215). The FCTC negotiations (1999-2005) corresponded with a rapid uptick in the number of countries represented within Globalink and new members were most often brought into the network through relationships with regional neighbors (AVGD=2.824, D=0.021, CC=0.253). Between 2006 and 2012, the centrality of the US in the network increases significantly (AVGD=3.414, D=0.023, CC=0.310). The findings suggest that global institutionalization through WHO, as with the FCTC, can lead to the rapid growth of decentralized online networks. Alternatively, private initiatives, such as the Bloomberg Initiative, can lead to clustering in which a single source of information gains increasing influence over an online network.",eng,Global health governance : the scholarly journal for the new health security paradigm,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

An innovative global health discussion platform allows capturing insights from the global health community on factors driving demand and supply for diagnostics. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of the online discussion 'Advancing Care Delivery: Driving Demand and Supply of Diagnostics' organised by the Global Health Delivery Project (GHD) (http://www.ghdonline.org/) at Harvard University. The discussion, driven by 12 expert panellists, explored what must be done to develop delivery systems, business models, new technologies, interoperability standards, and governance mechanisms to ensure that patients receive the right diagnostic at the right time. The GHD Online (GHDonline) platform reaches over 19 000 members from 185 countries. Participants (N=99) in the diagnostics discussion included academics, non-governmental organisations, manufacturers, policymakers, and physicians. Data was coded and overarching categories analysed using qualitative data analysis software. Participants considered technical characteristics of diagnostics as smaller barriers to effective use of diagnostics compared with operational and health system challenges, such as logistics, poor fit with user needs, cost, workforce, infrastructure, access, weak regulation and political commitment. Suggested solutions included: health system strengthening with patient-centred delivery; strengthened innovation processes; improved knowledge base; harmonised guidelines and evaluation; supply chain innovations; and mechanisms for ensuring quality and capacity. Engaging and connecting different actors involved with diagnostic development and use is paramount for improving diagnostics. While the discussion participants were not representative of all actors involved, the platform enabled a discussion between globally acknowledged experts and physicians working in different countries.",eng,BMJ global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Non-adherence can lead to drug-resistant HIV caused by failure to achieve maximal viral suppression. Optimal treatment requires the identification of patients at high risk of suboptimal adherence and targeted interventions. The aim of this review was to identify and summarise determinants of adherence to ART among HIV-positive adults.--NEW SECTION--Systematic review of adherence to ART in SSA from January 2002 to October 2014.--NEW SECTION--A systematic search was performed in 6 databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, Popline, Global Health Library) for qualitative and quantitative articles. Risk of bias was assessed. A meta-analysis was conducted for pooled estimates of effect size on adherence determinants.--NEW SECTION--Of the 4052 articles screened, 146 were included for final analysis, reporting on determinants of 161 922 HIV patients with an average adherence score of 72.9%. Main determinants of non-adherence were use of alcohol, male gender, use of traditional/herbal medicine, dissatisfaction with healthcare facility and healthcare workers, depression, discrimination and stigmatisation, and poor social support. Promoters of adherence included counselling and education interventions, memory aids, and active disclosure among people living with HIV. Determinants of health status had conflicting influence on adherence.--NEW SECTION--The sociodemographic, psychosocial, health status, treatment-related and intervention-related determinants are interlinked and contribute to optimal adherence. Clinics providing ART in SSA should therefore design targeted interventions addressing these determinants to optimise health outcomes.",eng,BMJ global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This study was aimed to determine the mortality risk for emergency abdominal paediatric surgery in low-income countries globally.--NEW SECTION--Multicentre, international, prospective, cohort study. Self-selected surgical units performing emergency abdominal surgery submitted prespecified data for consecutive children aged <16 years during a 2-week period between July and December 2014. The United Nation's Human Development Index (HDI) was used to stratify countries. The main outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality, analysed by multilevel logistic regression.--NEW SECTION--This study included 1409 patients from 253 centres in 43 countries; 282 children were under 2 years of age. Among them, 265 (18.8%) were from low-HDI, 450 (31.9%) from middle-HDI and 694 (49.3%) from high-HDI countries. The most common operations performed were appendectomy, small bowel resection, pyloromyotomy and correction of intussusception. After adjustment for patient and hospital risk factors, child mortality at 30 days was significantly higher in low-HDI (adjusted OR 7.14 (95% CI 2.52 to 20.23), p<0.001) and middle-HDI (4.42 (1.44 to 13.56), p=0.009) countries compared with high-HDI countries, translating to 40 excess deaths per 1000 procedures performed.--NEW SECTION--Adjusted mortality in children following emergency abdominal surgery may be as high as 7 times greater in low-HDI and middle-HDI countries compared with high-HDI countries.

We estimate the economic gain realised over an 11-year period resulting from a vertical surgical programme addressing cleft lip (CL) and cleft palate (CP).--NEW SECTION--The database from a large non-governmental organisation (Smile Train) over an 11-year period was analysed. Incidence-based disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted through the programme were calculated, discounted 3%, using disability weights from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and an effectiveness factor for each surgical intervention. The effectiveness factor allowed for the lack of 100% resolution of the disability from the operation. We used the value of lost welfare approach, based on the concept of the value of a statistical life (VSL), to assess the economic gain associated with each operation. Using income elasticities (IEs) tailored to the income level of each country, a country-specific VSL was calculated and the VSL-year (VSLY) was determined. The VSLY is the economic value of a DALY, and the DALYs averted were converted to economic gain per patient and aggregated to give a total value and an average per patient. Sensitivity analyses were performed based on the variations of IE applied for each country.--NEW SECTION--Each CL operation averted 2.2 DALYs on average and each CP operation 3.3. Total averted DALYs were 1 325 678 (CP 686 577 and CL 639 102). The economic benefit from the programme was between US$7.9 and US$20.7 billion. Per patient, the average benefit was between US$16 133 and US$42 351. Expense per DALY averted was estimated to be $149.--NEW SECTION--Addressing basic surgical needs in developing countries provides a massive economic boost through improved health. Expansion of surgical capacity in the developing world is of significant economic and health value and should be a priority in global health efforts.",eng,BMJ global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This systematic review assesses the effects of onsite midwife-led birth units (OMBUs) embedded within hospitals which provide comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care.--NEW SECTION--Both interventional and observational studies that compared OMBUs with standard medical-led obstetric care were eligible for inclusion. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Science Citation and Social Sciences Citation Index, Global Health Library and one Chinese database were searched. Meta-analysis was conducted to synthesise data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Findings of observational studies were summarised by forest plots with brief narratives.--NEW SECTION--Three RCTs, one controlled before-and-after study and six cohort studies were included. There were no or very few maternal and perinatal deaths in either OMBUs or standard obstetric units, with no significant differences between the two. Women giving birth in OMBUs were less likely to use epidural analgesia (risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.82; three trials, n=2431). The UK national cohort study and two other cohorts in China and Nepal found less oxytocin augmentation, more spontaneous vaginal deliveries, fewer caesarean sections and fewer episiotomies performed in OMBUs than in standard obstetric units. These differences were not statistically significant in RCTs and the remaining cohorts. One study investigated satisfaction with midwife-led birth care among women and midwives, with positive findings in both groups favouring OMBUs. In addition, two studies found that the total cost of birth was lower in OMBUs than in standard obstetric units.--NEW SECTION--OMBUs could be an alternative model for providing safe and cost-effective childbirth care, which may be particularly important in low- and middle-income countries to meet the growing demand for facility-based birth for low-risk women and improve efficiency of health systems.",eng,BMJ global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We believe that, to become more relevant for the health systems and communities that are their intended beneficiaries, Global Health practices must actively span and disrupt boundaries of geography, geopolitics and constituency, some of which are rooted in imbalances of power and resources. In this process, fostering cross-country learning networks and communities of practice, and building local and national institutions with a global outlook in low and middle-income countries, are critically important.

Access to evidence is instrumental in reducing diagnostic errors and generating better health outcomes. UpToDate, a leading evidence-based clinical resource is used extensively in the USA and other regions of the world and has been linked to lower mortality and length of stay in US hospitals. In 2009, the Global Health Delivery Project collaborated with UpToDate to provide free subscriptions to qualifying health workers in resource-limited settings. We evaluated the provision of UpToDate access to health workers by analysing their usage patterns. Since 2009, ∼2000 individual physicians and healthcare institutions from 116 countries have received free access to UpToDate through our programme. During 2013-2014, users logged into UpToDate ∼150 000 times; 61% of users logged in at least weekly; users in Africa were responsible for 54% of the total usage. Search patterns reflected local epidemiology with 'clinical manifestations of malaria' as the top search in Africa, and 'management of hepatitis B' as the top search in Asia. Our programme demonstrates that there are barriers to evidence-based clinical knowledge in resource-limited settings we can help remove.

Research on similar interview techniques used as part of a mental health treatment (eg, debriefing) has raised concerns that they might worsen mental health-more than doubling the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder in some studies. While controversy over the mental health impact of debriefing continues, debriefing treatments have been discontinued in most clinics nearly 2 decades ago. The purpose of this article is to promote the development and integration of preventative measures to limit potential mental health damage associated with legal endeavours to address human rights violations and international crimes.--NEW SECTION--Given the recent growth of the field of global mental health and its current capacity to provide feasible, acceptable, effective care in low-resource settings, we propose a research agenda to identify the mental health impact of current human rights legal practices and test a model of scalable medicolegal care that minimises risk by integrating mental health monitoring and applying up-to-date models of trauma treatment, including multiple meeting sessions, as indicated.--NEW SECTION--As the fields of global health, human rights law, international criminal law and transitional justice increasingly overlap in their efforts to assist communities affected by grave violence, we propose that synchronising efforts may offer important opportunities to improve mental health for survivors.",eng,BMJ global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Early identification through screening is important to negate the negative effects of untreated hearing impairment. Substantial barriers exist in screening for hearing impairment in LMICs, such as the requirement for skilled hearing health care professionals and prohibitively expensive specialist equipment to measure hearing. These challenges may be overcome through utilization of increasingly available smartphone app technologies for ear and hearing assessments that are easy to use by unskilled professionals.--NEW SECTION--Our objective was to identify and compare available apps for ear and hearing assessments and consider the incorporation of such apps into hearing screening programs.--NEW SECTION--In July 2015, the commercial app stores Google Play and Apple App Store were searched to identify apps for ear and hearing assessments. Thereafter, six databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, and mHealth Evidence) were searched to assess which of the apps identified in the commercial review had been validated against gold standard measures. A comparison was made between validated apps.--NEW SECTION--App store search queries returned 30 apps that could be used for ear and hearing assessments, the majority of which are for performing audiometry. The literature search identified 11 eligible validity studies that examined 6 different apps. uHear, an app for self-administered audiometry, was validated in the highest number of peer reviewed studies against gold standard pure tone audiometry (n=5). However, the accuracy of uHear varied across these studies.--NEW SECTION--Very few of the available apps have been validated in peer-reviewed studies.

The prevalence data as determined by microscopy and molecular methods were compared using chi-square tests.--NEW SECTION--Parasitaemia from these asymptomatic infections ranged from 40 to 3,520 parasites/µl of blood (geometric mean parasitaemia = 732 parasites/µl). The prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum carriage was 4.8% (10/209) and 13.9% (29/209) using microscopy and RT-PCR respectively. The overall prevalence of sub-microscopic infections in the total number of samples analysed was 9.1% (19/209) and 66% (19/29) of the asymptomatic infections. P. falciparum gametocytemia detected by microscopy was 1% (2/209) and 3.8% (8/209) by PCR.--NEW SECTION--This is the first report of sub-microscopic asexual and gametocytes infections in the dry season in a seasonal malaria transmission area in Ghana. It has established that persistent latent malaria infections occur and that these could supply the source of parasites for the next transmission season.

An interdisciplinary perspective is applied to analyze health policy changes at the national, regional, and global levels by drawing on data from key informant interviews, and institutional and civil society documents. It is demonstrated that, in the context of austerity measures, member states such as the UK and Greece reduced commitments to rights associated with HIV/AIDS; at the regional level, the EU failed to develop rights-based approaches to address the vulnerabilities and health care needs of key populations affected by HIV/AIDS, particularly migrants and sex workers; and at the global level, the EU backtracked on commitments to global health and is prioritizing the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies over the human rights of people living with HIV/AIDS.

In these resolutions, states promised to deliver affordable health care for everyone, referring to notions of equity and human rights law, particularly a human right to health. However, the explosion of migration coupled with the post-2008 bleak economic climate have led societies worldwide to restrict, or at least challenge, the affordability of access to national health systems for non-nationals. It is in this light that the claims of universality made by universal health coverage should be challenged.

28550158,10.1136/medethics-2015-102858,Viewing benefit sharing in global health research through the lens of Aristotelian justice.,"The ethics of benefit sharing has been a topical issue in global health research in resource-limited countries. It pertains to the distribution of goods, benefits and advantages to the research participants, communities and countries that are involved in research. One of the nuances in benefit sharing is the ethical justification on which the concept should be based. Extensive literature outlining the different principles underlying benefit sharing is available. The purpose of this paper is to examine the proposed principles using Aristotelian principles of justice. The paper assesses the central idea of Aristotelian justice and applies and evaluates this idea to benefit sharing in research, especially when commercial research sponsors conduct research in resource-limited countries. Two categories of Aristotelian justice-universal and particular-were examined and their contribution to the benefit-sharing discourse assessed. On the one hand, benefit sharing in accordance with universal justice requires that for-profit research sponsors obey the legal regulations and international standards set for benefit sharing. On the other hand, benefit sharing in accordance with particular justice transcends obeying legal requirements and standards to a realm of acting in an ethically accepted manner. Accordingly, the paper further examines three perspectives of particular justice and develops ethical justification for benefit sharing in global health research. As Aristotelian justice is still relevant to the contemporary discourse on justice, this paper broadens the ethical justifications of benefit sharing in global health research.",eng,Journal of medical ethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Traditionally, infectious disease was globally governed by the quarantine regulated by the international conventions. When an infectious disease outbreak occurred in one country, each country prevented transmission of the disease through the standardized quarantine since the installation of international sanitary convention in 1892. Republic of Korea also organized the infectious disease control system with quarantine and disease report procedure after the establishment of government. Additionally, Korea National Health Institute(KNIH) was founded as research and training institute for infectious disease. However, traditional international health regulation system faced a serious challenge by the appearance of emerging and re-emerging infectious disease in 1990s. As a result, global infectious disease governance was rapidly changed under the demand to global disease surveillance and response. Moreover, global health security frame became important after 2001 bioterror and 2003 SARS outbreak. Consequently, international health regulation was fully revised in 2005, which included not only infectious disease but also public health emergency. The new international health regime was differently characterized in several aspects; reinforcement of global cooperation and surveillance, enlargement of the role of supranational and international agencies, and reorganization of national capacity. KNIH was reorganized with epidemic control and research since late 1990s. However, in 2004 Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention(KCDC) was established as a disease control institution with combining quarantine and other functions after 2003 SARS outbreak. KCDC unified national function against infectious disease including prevention, protection, response and research, as a national representative in disease control. The establishment of KCDC can be understood as the adoption of new international health regulation system based upon SARS experience.",eng,Ui sahak,Historical Article,2025-04-23,2016

Here we use type 2 diabetes as a case study to illustrate the rise of noncommunicable diseases and call attention to the important role of primary care systems in addressing these diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Comprehensive screening for diabetes should be implemented through primary care systems to increase early detection of prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes - a first step to diabetes prevention and management. In addition, primary care systems should strengthen and expand capacity to link patients to appropriate interventions based on their diabetes status and provide care coordination (e.g. leveraging task-shifting and technology), and integrate clinic and community resources for diabetes prevention and control. Additional strategies should include continuous quality improvement, health systems strengthening, workforce development, and affordable and sustainable financing. Together, these actions could elevate the role of primary care in addressing diabetes in low- and middle-income countries and help advance global progress towards reducing diabetes complications, and also preventing or delaying diabetes among those at risk.",eng,The journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This study aims to enlighten pathways associated with HBV related liver fibrosis for delineation of potential new therapeutic targets and biomarkers.--NEW SECTION--Tissue samples from 47 HBV infected patients with different fibrotic stages (F1 to F6) were enrolled for 2D-DIGE proteomic screening. Differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and verified by western blotting. Functional proteomic associations were analyzed by EnrichNet application.--NEW SECTION--Fibrotic stage variations were observed for apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), pyruvate kinase PKM (KPYM), glyceraldehyde 3-phospahate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (DHE3), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), alcohol dehydrogenase (ALDH1A1), transferrin (TRFE), peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3), phenazine biosynthesis-like domain-containing protein (PBLD), immuglobulin kappa chain C region (IGKC), annexin A4 (ANXA4), keratin 5 (KRT5). Enrichment analysis with Reactome and Kegg databases highlighted the possible involvement of platelet release, glycolysis and HDL mediated lipid transport pathways. Moreover, string analysis revealed that HIF-1α (Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha), one of the interacting partners of HBx (Hepatitis B X protein), may play a role in the altered glycolytic response and oxidative stress observed in liver fibrosis.--NEW SECTION--To our knowledge, this is the first protomic research that studies HBV infected fibrotic human liver tissues to investigate alterations in protein levels and affected pathways among different fibrotic stages. Observed changes in the glycolytic pathway caused by HBx presence and therefore its interactions with HIF-1α can be a target pathway for novel therapeutic purposes.",eng,Proteome science,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

With the widespread utilization of molecular technologies such as next-generation sequencing and the advancement of bioinformatics tools, a new age of viral discovery has commenced. Many of the novel agents being discovered in recent years have been isolated from mosquitoes and exhibit a highly restricted host range. Strikingly, these insect-specific viruses have been found to be members of viral families traditionally associated with human arboviral pathogens, including but not limited to the families Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Reoviridae, and Bunyaviridae.

The aim of the study was to determine QoL among treated patients with advanced cancer (ACPs) in the island of Crete, Greece, their satisfaction with the given care and to evaluate possible differences in QoL between in- and day care clinic patients.--NEW SECTION--The QoL of 95 Greek ACPs with breast, lung, and colon cancer were evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3), and its Breast (QLQ-BR23) and Lung (QLQ-LC13) Cancer modules, while their satisfaction with the given care was evaluated with a 10-point questionnaire. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess associations of QoL with patients' demographic and clinical characteristics.--NEW SECTION--Patients reported moderate global health status/QoL (62.6) and higher cognitive, physical, and emotional scores (75.4, 66.8, and 66.6 respectively). In symptoms scales/items, all patients had mean scores <50 while higher mean scores were observed for fatigue (41.8) and dyspnea (36.2). No significant differences in functioning and symptoms scales were found between different cancer types. Sexual functioning in QLQ-BR23 and alopecia in QLQ-LC13 severely affected QoL. Hospitalized patients reported worse mean global QoL than those visiting the day care clinic (55.6 versus 67.6, p =0.017), as well as in all parameters described by QLQ-C30. Most patients were satisfied with the given care (≥8/10, 74.2% of patients).--NEW SECTION--ACPs in the present study were found to have an overall good QoL, functioning, and symptoms scores and were satisfied with the given care.

Reliable disease burden estimates are required for national strategies. This analysis estimates the global prevalence of viraemic HCV at the end of 2015, an update of-and expansion on-the 2014 analysis, which reported 80 million (95% CI 64-103) viraemic infections in 2013.--NEW SECTION--We developed country-level disease burden models following a systematic review of HCV prevalence (number of studies, n=6754) and genotype (n=11 342) studies published after 2013. A Delphi process was used to gain country expert consensus and validate inputs. Published estimates alone were used for countries where expert panel meetings could not be scheduled. Global prevalence was estimated using regional averages for countries without data.--NEW SECTION--Models were built for 100 countries, 59 of which were approved by country experts, with the remaining 41 estimated using published data alone. The remaining countries had insufficient data to create a model. The global prevalence of viraemic HCV is estimated to be 1·0% (95% uncertainty interval 0·8-1·1) in 2015, corresponding to 71·1 million (62·5-79·4) viraemic infections. Genotypes 1 and 3 were the most common cause of infections (44% and 25%, respectively).--NEW SECTION--The global estimate of viraemic infections is lower than previous estimates, largely due to more recent (lower) prevalence estimates in Africa. Additionally, increased mortality due to liver-related causes and an ageing population may have contributed to a reduction in infections.--NEW SECTION--John C Martin Foundation.",eng,The lancet.

In this report, we summarise these discussions. Countries differ in their policy responses to HBV and HCV; however, substantial systemic, cultural, and financial barriers to achievement of elimination of these infections persist in all countries. Common challenges to elimination include limited availability of reliable epidemiological data; insufficient public awareness of risk factors and modes of transmission, leading to underdiagnosis; high rates of transmission through infected blood products, including in medical settings; limited access to care for people who inject drugs; prevailing stigma and discrimination against people infected with viral hepatitis; and financial barriers to treatment and care. Despite these challenges, promising examples of effective programmes, public-private initiatives, and other innovative approaches are evident in all countries we studied in Asia Pacific. The draft WHO Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis 2016-21 provides a solid framework upon which governments can build their local strategies towards viral hepatitis. However, greater recognition by national governments and the international community of the urgency to comprehensively tackle both HBV and HCV are still needed. In all countries, strategic plans and policy goals need to be translated into resources and concrete actions, with national governments at the helm, to enable a sustainable response to the rising burden of hepatitis B and C in all countries.",eng,The lancet.

This has happened despite intractable challenges relating to the measurement of maternal mortality. Even after three decades of measurement innovation, maternal mortality data are widely presumed to be of poor quality, or, as one leading measurement expert has put it, 'guilty until proven innocent'. This paper explores how and why leading epidemiologists, demographers and statisticians have devoted the better part of the last three decades to producing ever more sophisticated and expensive surveys and mathematical models of globally comparable MMR estimates. The development of better metrics is publicly justified by the need to know which interventions save lives and at what cost. We show, however, that measurement experts' work has also been driven by the need to secure political priority for safe motherhood and by donors' need to justify and monitor the results of investment flows. We explore the many effects and consequences of this measurement work, including the eclipsing of attention to strengthening much-needed national health information systems. We analyse this measurement work in relation to broader political and economic changes affecting the global health field, not least the incursion of neoliberal, business-oriented donors such as the World Bank and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation whose institutional structures have introduced new forms of administrative oversight and accountability that depend on indicators.",eng,Critical public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Intentional weight loss may alter vitamin D status and, conversely, vitamin D supplementation has been hypothesized to aid in weight loss. A systematic literature search in PubMed/Medline identified 3173 articles of which 37 studies (randomized controlled trials (RCT) [n=17], non-RCTs [n=20]) are summarized as effect of: (I) diet-induced weight loss on vitamin D status (n=7), (II) vitamin D supplementation on diet-induced weight loss (n=11), (III) surgery-induced weight loss on vitamin D status (n=15), and (IV) vitamin D supplementation after surgery-induced weight loss on vitamin D status (n=5). While all studies on the effect of diet-induced weight loss on vitamin D status have consistently reported increased vitamin D levels, the targeted percentage of weight loss that is necessary for an increase has varied between 5% and >10%. N=11 RCTs testing the effect of vitamin D supplementation observe that vitamin D supplementation does not result in increased weight loss, but may affect body fat loss. Vitamin D deficiency and subsequent hyperparathyroidism have been detected in post-surgery patients, and there is evidence that vitamin D supplementation improves these post-surgery complications. We review the current evidence addressing the role of vitamin D status and supplementation in diet- and surgery-induced weight loss. Subsequently, we highlight gaps in current research and suggest directions for future research including differences in vitamin D supplementation dosages, indoor vs. outdoor exercise, and the assessment of vitamin D status in different body pools.",eng,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

The response to Zika must involve a paradigm shift from traditional to novel methods of mosquito control, and according to the World Health Organization should incorporate the release of mosquitoes infected with the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachiapipientis. In our recent paper [Dutra, HLC et al., Cell Host & Microbe 2016] we investigated the potential of Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypti to restrict infection and transmission of Zika virus recently isolated in Brazil. Wolbachia is now well known for its ability to block or reduce infection with a variety of pathogens in different mosquito species including the dengue (DENV), yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses, and malaria-causing Plasmodium, and consequently has great potential to control mosquito-transmitted diseases across the globe. Our results demonstrated that the wMel Wolbachia strain in Brazilian Ae. aegypti is a strong inhibitor of ZIKV infection, and furthermore appears to prevent transmission of infectious viral particles in mosquito saliva, which highlights the bacterium's suitability for more widespread use in Zika control.",eng,"Microbial cell (Graz, Austria)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Since the early 2000s, numerous policy initiatives have been created to facilitate the entry of international medical graduates (IMGs) into the Canadian workforce. In Ontario, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) developed alternative licensure routes to increase the ability of qualified IMGs to obtain licenses to practice. The current study provides demographic and descriptive information about the IMGs registered through the CPSO's alternative licensure routes between 2000 and 2012. An analysis of the characteristics and career trajectories of all IMGs practicing in the province sheds light on broader globalization trends and raises questions about the future of health human resource planning in Canada. As the medical profession becomes increasingly globalized, health policy and regulation will continue to be influenced by trends in international migration, concerns about global health equity, and the shifting demographics of the Canadian physician workforce.

This lack of access to treatment has been long-standing, but there is now a growing consensus about the urgent need to prioritize solutions to this problem and that a global strategy is required for them to be successful. An essential element of making radiotherapy universally accessible is a coordinated approach to clinical training and practice. This has been recently recognized by many university departments and clinical training programs. However, formalized training and career promotion tracks in global health within radiation oncology have been slow to emerge, thereby limiting the sustained involvement of students and faculty, and restricting opportunities for leadership in this space. We examine here potential structures and benefits of formalized global health training in radiation oncology. We explore how defining specific competencies in this area can help trainees and practitioners integrate their activities in global health within their existing roles as clinicians, educators, or scientists. This would also help create a new global health track for academic advancement, which could focus on such domains as implementation science, health service, and advocacy.

Reverse innovation has been identified as a key emerging trend in global health systems in part because low-resourced settings are particularly good laboratories for low-cost/high-impact innovations that are developed out of necessity. A difficult question receiving scant attention is that of legal and regulatory barriers.--NEW SECTION--The objective of this paper is to understand and elucidate the legal barriers faced by innovators bringing health interventions to the United States.--NEW SECTION--Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 9 key informants who have directly participated in the introduction of global health care approaches to the United States health system. A purposive sampling scheme was employed to identify participants. Phone interviews were conducted over one week in July 2016 with each participant and lasted an average of 35 minutes each.--NEW SECTION--Purely legal barriers included questions surrounding tort liability, standard of care, and concerns around patient-administered self-care. Regulatory burdens included issues of international medical licensure, reimbursement, and task shifting and scope of work challenges among nonprofessionals (e.g. community health workers). Finally, perceived (i.e. not realized or experienced) legal and regulatory barriers to innovative modalities served as disincentives to bringing products or services developed outside of the United States to the United States market.--NEW SECTION--Conflicting interests within the health care system, safety concerns, and little value placed on low-cost interventions inhibit innovation. Legal and regulatory barriers rank among, and contribute to, an anti-innovation atmosphere in healthcare for domestic and reverse innovators alike. Reverse innovation should be fostered through the thoughtful development of legal and regulatory standards that encourage the introduction and scalable adoption of successful health care innovations developed outside of the US, particularly innovations that support public health goals and do not have the benefit of a large corporate sponsor to facilitate introduction to the market.",eng,Annals of global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

28314493,10.1016/j.aogh.2016.10.010,Beyond Visas and Vaccines: Preparing Students for Domestic and Global Health Engagement.,"At campuses across the United States, scores of students are embarking on global health experiences in low- and middle-income countries. The desire to improve the health of poor communities while preparing for future health careers is often the main driver. The spotlight on domestic health issues also has fueled a resurgence of interest in underserved communities in the United States. Regardless of the destination, rigorous preparation is needed to ensure that the students' presence benefits the communities they aim to serve. Development of mutually beneficial programs with host communities coupled with thoughtful preparation of students is essential to the future of these university programs but, more importantly, to achieve the goal of shared learning and capacity building across borders. US program leaders may not fully consider the potential risks that can occur to their programs from involving poorly prepared students, or these risks may appear largely theoretical. However, many experienced practitioners and their international collaborators can relate examples of damaged partnerships, adverse consequences on community structures, dangers to patient safety, and harmed professional reputations and credibility. Domestic health experiences do not require a visa or vaccines but bring students in contact with many of the same ethical, professional, and cross-cultural challenges as overseas endeavors. Fortunately, best practices for preparing students to confront these challenges have emerged from years of experience in domestic and global contexts alike. It all begins with establishing institutional partnerships built on principles of reciprocity and respect. Through careful program design, universities can align missions, goals, and expectations to best serve all invested parties: local partners, students, faculty, staff, and the communities where they will be working. A second critical component is appropriate student selection. Matching student skills with partner needs can optimize benefits for both the host organization and student. Finally, universities can prepare students to navigate in cross-cultural settings in a professional and ethical manner through careful training. Just as negative experiences can have lasting negative consequences, the best ones can lead to strengthened partnerships; durable benefits for local and global communities; and optimal learning for students, their supervisors, and hosts.",eng,Annals of global health,Editorial,2025-04-23,2016

The Public Health Institute, through its Global Health Fellows Program (I and II), has been in a unique position to identify the shifting employment dynamic in global health.--NEW SECTION--The purpose of the survey was to gather information on global health employers' hiring practices and insights into the importance of nonclinical skills in contributing to successful professional work; preparedness of graduates with needed nonclinical skills; and the value of domestic work experience for global health careers. The focus was on individuals primarily raised in the United States who studied global health in either graduate or undergraduate settings.--NEW SECTION--A web-based survey and telephone interviews were conducted in early 2015. Overall, 49 project directors from 32 organizations participated.--NEW SECTION--Key findings included: CONCLUSIONS: The process of preparing professionals for global health work has fallen behind emerging realities, including globalization, ever-evolving technologies, and advances in health care.

28299152,10.4081/jphia.2016.534,"Ebola Viral Disease in West Africa: A Threat to Global Health, Economy and Political Stability.","The West African sub-continent is currently experiencing its first, and ironically, the largest and longest Ebola viral diseases (EVD) outbreak ever documented in modern medical history. The current outbreak is significant in several ways, including longevity, magnitude of morbidity and mortality, occurrence outside the traditional niches, rapid spread and potential of becoming a global health tragedy. The authors provided explicit insights into the current and historical background, drivers of the epidemic, societal impacts, status of vaccines and drugs development and proffered recommendations to halt and prevent future occurrences. The authors reviewed mainly five databases and a hand search of key relevant literature. We reviewed 51 articles that were relevant up until the 18th of August 2014. The authors supplemented the search with reference list of relevant articles and grey literature as well as relevant Internet websites. Article searches were limited to those published either in English or French. There are strong indications that the EVD may have been triggered by increased human activities and encroachment into the forest ecosystem spurred by increasing population and poverty-driven forest-dependent local economy. Containment efforts are being hampered by weak and fragile health systems, including public health surveillance and weak governance, certain socio-anthropological factors, fast travels (improved transport systems) and globalization. The societal impacts of the EBV outbreak are grave, including economic shutdown, weakening of socio-political systems, psychological distress, and unprecedented consumption of scarce health resources. The research and development (R&D) pipeline for product against EBV seems grossly insufficient. The outbreak of Ebola and the seeming difficulty to contain the epidemic is simply a reflection of the weak health system, poor surveillance and emergency preparedness/response, poverty and disconnect between the government and the people in many West African countries. Although interventions by the United Nations and other international development agencies could ultimately halt the epidemic, local communities must be engaged to build trust and create demand for the public health interventions being implemented in the Ebola-ravaged populations. In the intermediate and long term, post-Ebola rehabilitation should focus on strengthening of health systems, improving awareness about zoonosis and health behaviors, alleviating poverty and mitigating the impact of triggering factors. Finally, national governments and international development partners should mobilize huge resources and investments to spur or facilitate R&D of disease control tools for emerging and pernicious infectious diseases (not limited to EVD).",eng,Journal of public health in Africa,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This level of sustainability is rarely achieved with current models of global health intervention that rely on continuous injection of resources or persistent external presence on the ground. Presented here is a case study of a flipped approach to creating capacity and adoption through an engagement strategy centered around an innovative mHealth device and connected service. Through an impact-oriented business model, this mHealth solution engages stakeholders in a cohesive and interdependent network by appealing to the pain points for each actor throughout the health system.

Multiple actors (governmental and non-governmental) and countries have played their part in the reformation of the global healthcare system. New opportunities are presenting themselves while multiple challenges still remain especially in developing countries. Better way to proceed would be to learn from historical patterns while we plan for the future in a technology-driven society with dynamic demographic, epidemiological and economic uncertainties.--NEW SECTION--A structured review of both peer-reviewed and gray literature on the topic was carried out.--NEW SECTION--On the whole, people are healthier, doing better financially and live longer today than 30 years ago. The number of under-5 mortality worldwide has declined from 12.7 million in 1990 to 6.3 million in 2013. Infant and maternal mortality rates have also been reduced. However, both rates are still considered high in Africa and some Asian countries. The world's population nearly doubled in these 30 years, from 4.8 billion in 1985 to 7.2 billion in 2015. The majority of the increasing population was coming from the least developed countries, i.e., 3.66 to 5.33 billion. The world will be short of 12.9 million health-care workers by 2035; today, that figure stands at 7.2 million. Health care expenditures among countries also show sharp differences. In high income countries, per person health expenditure is over USD 3,000 on average, while in poor countries, it is as low as USD 12, WHO estimate of minimum spending per person per year needed to provide basic, life-saving services is USD 44. The challenges faced by the global health system over the past 30 years have been increased in population and urbanization, behavioral changes, rise in chronic diseases, traumatic injuries, infectious diseases, specific regional conflicts and healthcare delivery security. Over the next 30 years, most of the world population growth will occur in the urban areas of poor countries. The rapid, unplanned and unsustainable style of urban development will make developing countries cities the key focal points for emerging environmental and health hazards. Changes will be seen in design, culture and practices of hospitals to better meet the needs of patients, families and providers. Top driving factors of global healthcare system for next 30 years will be leading causes of mortalities, non-health factors (impact of nutrition, sanitation and women's empowerment), investment in health workforce and growth of medical tourism in future healthcare scenario.--NEW SECTION--Evaluating the patterns of previous 30 years and predicting the progress and challenges of future health system are no rocket science. Medical care will be more self-directed in a more tech-savvy population as information will be more accessible and user friendly with higher quality. Health driving factors such as clean water, sanitation and food will take the center stage in humanities struggle and even increase population size.",eng,mHealth,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Many instances of in-flight transmission have been documented, but the relative influence of the many factors (see below) affecting in-flight transmission has not been quantified. Long-standing guidance by public health agencies is that the primary transmission risk associated with air travel for most respiratory infectious diseases is associated with sitting within two rows of an infectious passenger. The effect of proximity may be one of these factors.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this study was to determine the risk of infection within and beyond the 2-row rule given by public health guidance.--NEW SECTION--We searched the literature for reports of in-flight transmission of infection which included seat maps indicating where the infectious and infected passengers were seated.--NEW SECTION--There is a ∼ 6% risk to passengers seated within the 2-rows of infected individual(s) and there is ∼ 2% risk to passengers seated beyond 2-rows from the infectious individual.--NEW SECTION--Contact tracing limited to passengers within 2-rows of the infectious individual(s) could fail to detect other cases of infections. This has important consequences for assessing the spread of infectious diseases.--NEW SECTION--Infection at a distance from the index case indicates other factors, such as airflow, movement of passenger/crew members, fomites and contacts between passengers in the departure gate before boarding, or after deplaning, are involved.",eng,Annals of global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Ancestry search of the American College of Physicians statement identified specific publications that provided additional detail on key steps in the guideline development process, with additional focus given to evidence, equity, and local adaptation considerations.--NEW SECTION--Our adaptation produced a 5-step process for developing locally optimized protocols for diagnosis and treatment of common conditions seen in MSTs. For specified conditions, this process includes: 1) a focused environmental scan of current practices based on grey literature protocols from MST sending organizations; 2) a review of relevant practice guidelines; 3) a literature review assessing the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the specified condition; 4) an eDelphi process with experts representing MST and Latin American and the Caribbean partner organizations assessing identified guidelines; and 5) external peer review and summary.--NEW SECTION--This protocol will enable the creation of practice guidelines that are based on best available evidence, local knowledge, and equitable considerations.

Many publications describe individual partnerships and projects, and tools are available for guiding collaborations, but systematic mappings of the basic, common characteristics of partnerships are scarce.--NEW SECTION--To document and categorize the international interuniversity partnerships deemed significant to building the capacity of medicine, nursing, and public health programs of 4 East African universities.--NEW SECTION--Two universities in Kenya and 2 in Tanzania were purposefully selected. Key informant interviews, conducted with 42 senior representatives of the 4 universities, identified partnerships they considered significant for increasing the capacity of their institutions' medicine, nursing, and public health programs in education, research, or service. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed. Partners were classified by country of origin and corresponding international groupings, duration, programs, and academic health science components.--NEW SECTION--One hundred twenty-nine university-to-university partnerships from 23 countries were identified. Each university reported between 25 and 36 international university partners. Seventy-four percent of partnerships were with universities in high-income countries, 15% in low- and middle-income countries, and 11% with consortia. Seventy percent included medicine, 37% nursing, and 45% public health; 15% included all 3 programs. Ninety-two percent included an education component, 47% research, and 24% service; 12% included all 3 components.--NEW SECTION--This study confirms the rapid growth of interuniversity cross-border health partnerships this century. It also finds, however, that there is a pool of established international partnerships from numerous countries at each university. Most partnerships that seek to strengthen universities in East Africa should likely ensure they have a significant education component.

GH clinical electives (GHCEs) are opportunities for students to experience a medical system and culture different from their own. GHCEs are administered through institutional affiliation agreements, often between an institution in a high-income country (HIC) and one in a low- or middle-income country (LMIC). Although these agreements suggest the exchange of students in both directions, GHCEs are traditionally characterized by students from HICs traveling to LMICs.--NEW SECTION--The goal of this study was to investigate the availability of opportunities for students from LMICs participating in GHCEs at partner institutions in HICs and to describe the costs of these opportunities for students from LMICs.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a web-based search of 30 US institutions previously identified as having structured programs in GH. We determined which of these schools have programs that accept medical students from international schools for GHCEs, as well as the administrative requirements, types of fees, and other costs to the international student based on information available on the web. Descriptive statistics were employed for the quantitative analysis of costs.--NEW SECTION--We found that, although the majority of US institutions with structured GH programs sending students to sites abroad accept international students at their sites in the United States, nearly one-fifth of programs do not offer such opportunities for bidirectional exchange. We also characterized the substantial costs of such experiences, because this can represent a significant barrier for students from LMICs.--NEW SECTION--Access to GHCEs in US partner institutions should be an important underlying ethical principle in the establishment of institutional partnerships.

Measures included evidence of impact; evidence of cost-effectiveness; and monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.--NEW SECTION--Researchers identified many examples of legal interventions effectively reducing NCD risk factors. Key enabling factors for effective NCD-related laws include regulatory capacity; governance mechanisms promoting multisectoral collaboration and accountability; and tailoring interventions to local legal, economic and social contexts.--NEW SECTION--In the EMR, and globally, law can be a cost-effective and affordable means of curbing underlying drivers of the NCD pandemic, such as rampant junk food marketing. Building upon this research, together with international and regional experts, EMRO has identified 10 priority interventions in the areas of tobacco control, unhealthy diets and NCD governance.

Exacerbations are acute events involving the worsening of asthma's primary respiratory symptoms and are a major cause of morbidity in asthma patients, largely due to the unpredictability of their onset. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between changes in acoustic features of inhaler inhalations and changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) that occur during a simulated exacerbation, a bronchial challenge test (BCT). This is a clinical test that simulates an asthma exacerbation through the administration of a bronchoconstrictor agent. Eight patients indicated for a BCT were recruited for this study. Non-contact and tracheal microphones were employed to record Diskus™ inhaler inhalations throughout the course of a BCT. A spirometer was employed to measure inhaler peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR). In patients responsive to the BCT (n=4), significant correlations between changes in FEV1 and acoustic features on both microphones existed, with fractal increment of Katz fractal dimension yielding the strongest correlation (R=0.58), and between FEV1 and PIFR (R=0.62). These findings suggest that inhaler inhalation acoustic features may assist in the early detection of exacerbations.

Alveolar macrophages, as the primary host cell of this intracellular bacterium, play an important role in the course of disease. Vitamin D3 is known to have a potent effect on macrophage behavior during infection, modulating the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immune effector molecules. In a vitamin D3 deficient host, the immune systems response to infection is greatly impaired. We used a quantitative systems biology approach to model the intracellular effects of vitamin D3 and compared our simulation output to our in vitro model of mycobacterium infection of macrophages in the presence and absence of Vitamin D3. Our in silico model results agreed with the in vitro assay results of interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory protein whose production is known to be influenced by vitamin D3.

RECAP-VN is a semi-structured program that provides students with classroom social skills training, and teachers with in-classroom consultation on program implementation and classroom-wide behavior management. Project data were collected at three time-points across the academic year from 443 2nd grade students in regards to their social skills and mental health functioning, in the Vietnamese cities of Hanoi and Danang. Mental health functioning (emotional and behavioral mental health problems) was the ultimate outcome target (at Time 3), with social skills intermediate (at Time 2) outcomes targeted to improve mental health functioning. Significant treatment effects were found on both social skills and mental health functioning. However, although program effects on mental health functioning were significant for both low and high risk status groups, program effects on social skills were only significant for low risk status students, suggesting that different mechanisms may underlie program effects for high and low risk status students. Overall the results of this study, one of the first to assess directly the effects of a school-based program on mental health functioning in a low or middle income country, provide some support for the value of using school-based programs to address the substantial child mental health treatment gap found in low- and middle-income countries.",eng,School Psychology International,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Caloric restriction, with or without exclusion of certain types of food, is often a key component. Fasting varies significantly among different populations according to cultural habits and local climate conditions. Religious fasting in terms of patterns (continuous versus intermittent) and duration can vary from 1 to 200 d; thus, the positive and negative impact on health can be considerable. Advantages of religious fasting are claimed by many but have been explored mainly by a limited number of studies conducted in Buddhist, Christian, or Muslim populations. These trials indicate that religious fasting has beneficial effects on body weight and glycemia, cardiometabolic risk markers, and oxidative stress parameters. Animals exposed to a diet mimicking fasting have demonstrated weight loss as well as lowered plasma levels of glucose, triacylglycerols, and insulin growth factor-1, although lean body mass remained stable. Diabetic mice on repeated intermittent fasting had less insulin resistance that mice fed ad libitum. The long-term significance of such changes on global health remains to be explored. This review summarizes the data available with regard to benefits of fasting followed for religious reasons on human health, body anthropometry, and cardio-metabolic risk markers; aims to bridge the current knowledge gap on available evidence and suggests considerations for the future research agenda. Future studies should explore every type of religious fasting, as well as their consequences in subpopulations such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly, or patients with chronic metabolic diseases.",eng,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Workshop participants representing human, animal, and environmental health ministries were selected as core decision-making participants. Over 300 articles describing the zoonotic diseases considered at the workshop were reviewed for disease specific information on prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and DALYs for Ethiopia or the East Africa region. Committee members individually ranked the importance of each criterion to generate a final group weight for each criterion.--NEW SECTION--Forty-three zoonotic diseases were evaluated. Criteria selected in order of importance were: 1)severity of disease in humans, 2)proportion of human disease attributed to animal exposure, 3)burden of animal disease, 4)availability of interventions, and 5)existing inter-sectoral collaboration. Based on the results from the decision tree analysis and subsequent discussion, participants identified the following five priority zoonotic diseases: rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis, and echinococcosis.--NEW SECTION--Multi-sectoral collaborations strengthen disease surveillance system development in humans and animals, enhance laboratory capacity, and support implementation of prevention and control strategies. To facilitate this, the creation of a One Health-focused Zoonotic Disease Unit is recommended. Enhancement of public health and veterinary laboratories, joint outbreak and surveillance activities, and intersectoral linkages created to tackle the prioritized zoonotic diseases will undoubtedly prepare the country to effectively address newly emerging zoonotic diseases.",eng,"One health (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Given substantial evidence regarding the impact of point of sale advertising (PoS), we analyzed the prevalence of encountering such advertising in Mumbai, India.--NEW SECTION--A survey was conducted of 199 current and recent former tobacco users recruited at the Tata Memorial Hospital (Mumbai). Enrollees were queried regarding their exposure to tobacco advertising in the last 30 days through multiple media sources. Descriptive epidemiologic techniques were used to characterize the data.--NEW SECTION--Overall, 95% of participants were men and 5% were women (mean age=49 years). All were current tobacco users or quit using all forms of tobacco in the last 60 days. Participants' responses revealed that PoS tobacco advertising had been encountered in the last 30 days for cigarettes (61%), bidis (54%), and smokeless tobacco (59%). Other forms of tobacco advertising were virtually non-existent.--NEW SECTION--PoS tobacco advertising remains prominent and highly visible to consumers in Mumbai, India, indicating corporate exploitation of a loophole in the COPTA legislation. Given the observed compliance with the currently imposed bans, revisions of COPTA to include all forms of tobacco promotion and advertising would be impactful.",eng,Tobacco regulatory science,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In choosing a PRO to track general health status, it is necessary to consider which measure will be the most responsive to change after treatment. To date, no studies exist comparing responsiveness among the EQ-5D, PROMIS 10 Global Health, and the Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12).--NEW SECTION--To determine which of the generic PROs are most responsive internally and externally in the setting of knee arthroscopy.--NEW SECTION--Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3.--NEW SECTION--Fifty patients who underwent knee arthroscopy were surveyed preoperatively and a mean 3.6 months postoperatively, with 90% follow-up. PROs included the EQ-5D, EQ-5D visual analog scale, PROMIS 10 Global Health (PROMIS 10) physical and mental components, VR-12 physical and mental components, and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)-pain subscale. Internal responsiveness was evaluated by performing paired t tests on the changes in measures and calculating 2 measures of effect size: Cohen d and standardized response mean (SRM). External responsiveness was evaluated by comparing Pearson correlation measures between the disease-specific reference KOOS-pain and generic PROs.--NEW SECTION--For internal responsiveness, 3 PROs showed a statistically significant improvement in score after treatment (EQ-5D: +0.10 [95% CI, 0.06-0.15], VR-12 physical: +7.2 [95% CI, 4.0-10.4]), and PROMIS 10 physical: +4.4 [95% CI, 2.6-6.3]) and effect size statistics with moderate change (Cohen d and SRM, 0.5-0.8). Assessing external responsiveness, a high correlation with the disease-specific reference (KOOS-pain score) was found for EQ-5D (0.65), VR-12 physical (0.57), and PROMIS 10 physical (0.77). For both internal and external responsiveness, the EQ-5D, VR-12 physical, and PROMIS 10 physical showed significantly greater responsiveness compared with the other general PRO measures but no statistical differences among themselves.--NEW SECTION--There is no statistical difference in internal or external responsiveness to change among the EQ-5D, VR-12 physical, and PROMIS 10 physical instruments. In tracking longitudinal patient health, researchers and administrators have the flexibility to choose any of the general PROs among the EQ-5D, VR-12 physical, and PROMIS 10 physical.

From September 2014 to April 2015, we conducted 43 semi-structured interviews about factors that encourage and discourage policy-makers' support for childhood obesity prevention policies. We interviewed policy-makers (n = 12) and two other groups engaged with childhood obesity prevention policies: representatives of non-governmental organizations (n = 24) and academics (n = 7). Factors that encourage policy-makers' support for childhood obesity prevention policies included: positive impact on government finances, an existing evidence base, partnerships with community-based collaborators, and consistency with policy-makers' priorities. Factors that discourage policy-makers' support included the following: perceptions about government's role, food and beverage industry opposition, and policy-makers' beliefs about personal responsibility.

The aim of this study was to examine trends in first-authorship for researchers from LMIC institutions (LMIC first-authors) over the period 1990-2013.--NEW SECTION--This study systematically reviewed research articles about randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis (TB) conducted in LMICs from 1990 to 2013, and identified the institutional affiliations of the authors. Key variables extracted from the articles included author affiliation, funding source, disease, intervention type, region and year of publication. Poisson regression was used to explore the impact of these key variables on LMIC first-authorship over time.--NEW SECTION--A total of 1593 articles were identified, of which 49.8% had LMIC first-authors. From 1990 to 2000 a total of 222 trials were published, and from 2001 to 2013 a total of 1371 trials were published, with a steady year-on-year increase over the period particularly evident in trials conducted in Africa. Whereas the absolute total number of LMIC first-authors has increased, as a proportion of all authors it declined. The relative rate increase in first-authorships post 2000 was 11.8-fold for non-LMIC first-authors and 2.8-fold for LMIC authors. LMIC first-authorship increased over time for research funded from LMIC; but LMIC first-authorship declined over time for research funded from high income countries (HIC).--NEW SECTION--The absolute increase in the number of trials in HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in Africa has led to a modest increase in LMIC first-authors, and a much larger increase in non-LMIC authors. The findings suggest that more inclusive policies by international funders are important in shifting research control to LMICs and improving research equity in the future.",eng,International journal of epidemiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

One of the possible mechanisms of tissue damages caused by this toxic metal is oxidative stress, which in turn may cause numerous pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia. The present study was conducted to determine the relationship between maternal Blood Lead Level (BLL) and preeclampsia.--NEW SECTION--The present case-control study was conducted on 158 pregnant women admitted to a hospital in Zanjan, Iran, from August 2015 to March 2016. To measure their BLL, 1.5 cc of blood was drawn from each participant. The demographic and obstetric details of the patients were recorded in a form. The potentiometric method was used to test the samples. The data obtained were analyzed by SPSS version 22, using Mann-Whitney U test, the Chi square, independent-samples t-test, Pearson product-moment correlation, and simple linear regression analysis.--NEW SECTION--The mean BLL was 6.24±1.74 μg/dl in the control group and 8.04±3.4 μg/dl in the preeclampsia group. The two groups were matching in terms of the mother's age and education and the household income. A significant relationship was observed between BLL and preeclampsia (p=0.028), as per every unit of increase (1 μg/dl) in BLL, systolic blood pressure increased by 0.014 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 0.013 mm Hg (p=0.004).--NEW SECTION--The results obtained suggest a relationship between BLL and preeclampsia.

28138518,10.1126/sciadv.1600844,Decellularized zebrafish cardiac extracellular matrix induces mammalian heart regeneration.,"Heart attack is a global health problem that leads to significant morbidity, mortality, and health care burden. Adult human hearts have very limited regenerative capability after injury. However, evolutionarily primitive species generally have higher regenerative capacity than mammals. The extracellular matrix (ECM) may contribute to this difference. Mammalian cardiac ECM may not be optimally inductive for cardiac regeneration because of the fibrotic, instead of regenerative, responses in injured adult mammalian hearts. Given the high regenerative capacity of adult zebrafish hearts, we hypothesize that decellularized zebrafish cardiac ECM (zECM) made from normal or healing hearts can induce mammalian heart regeneration. Using zebrafish and mice as representative species of lower vertebrates and mammals, we show that a single administration of zECM, particularly the healing variety, enables cardiac functional recovery and regeneration of adult mouse heart tissues after acute myocardial infarction. zECM-treated groups exhibit proliferation of the remaining cardiomyocytes and multiple cardiac precursor cell populations and reactivation of ErbB2 expression in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, zECM exhibits pro-proliferative and chemotactic effects on human cardiac precursor cell populations in vitro. These contribute to the structural preservation and correlate with significantly higher cardiac contractile function, notably less left ventricular dilatation, and substantially more elastic myocardium in zECM-treated hearts than control animals treated with saline or decellularized adult mouse cardiac ECM. Inhibition of ErbB2 activity abrogates beneficial effects of zECM administration, indicating the possible involvement of ErbB2 signaling in zECM-mediated regeneration. This study departs from conventional focuses on mammalian ECM and introduces a new approach for cardiac tissue regeneration.",eng,Science advances,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

It is ranked first in females in Morocco (accounting for 33.4% of the total cancer burden) and more than 60% of cases are diagnosed at stage III or IV. During the last decade, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has become an important aspect of breast cancer treatment. The objective of this study was to describe self-reported HRQOL in patients with breast cancer and to investigate its associations with sociodemographic and clinical variables. Methods: A prospective study was carried out in the main oncology centers in Morocco. Quality of life was measured using the Moroccan Arabic versions of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C 30 (EORTC QLQ C30) and the Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BR23). Statistical analyses were performed using descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 1463 subjects were included in the study, with a mean age of 55.6 (SD. 11.2) years, 70% being married. The majority had stage II (45.9%) and a few cases stage IV (12.9%) lesions. The participants’ global health mean score was 68.5 and in “functional scales”, social functioning scored the highest (Mean 86.2 (SD=22.7)). The most distressing symptom on the symptom scale was financial difficulties (Mean 63.2 (SD=38.2)). Using the disease specific tool, it was found that future perspective scored the lowest (Mean 40.5 (SD=37.3)). On the symptom scale, arm symptoms scored the highest (Mean 23.6 (SD=21.6)).

Patients with TB have a high rate of vitamin D deficiency, both at diagnosis and during the course of treatment with anti-tuberculosis drugs. Although data on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) clearance is uncertain from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), vitamin D enhances the expression of the anti-microbial peptide human cathelicidin (hCAP18) in cultured macrophages in vitro. One possible explanation for the mixed (primarily negative) results of RCTs examining vitamin D treatment in TB infection is that anti-TB drugs given to enrolled subjects may impact actions of vitamin D to enhance cathelicidin in macrophages. To address this hypothesis, human macrophage-like monocytic (THP-1) cells were treated with varying doses of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in the presence of the active form of vitamin D, 1N1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). The expression of hCAP18 was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 1,25(OH)2D3 strongly induced expression of hCAP18 mRNA in THP-1 cells (fold-change from control). The combination of the standard 4-drug TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) in the cultured THP-1 cells demonstrated a significant decrease of hCAP18 mRNA at the dosage of 10 ug/mL. In 31 subjects with newly diagnosed drug-sensitive TB randomized to either high-dose vitamin D3 (1.2 million IU over 8 weeks, n=13) versus placebo (n=18), there was no change from baseline to week 8 in hCAP18 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in plasma concentrations of LL-37, the protein product of hCAP18.These data suggest that first-line anti-TB drugs may alter the vitamin D-dependent increase in hCAP18 and LL-37 human macrophages.",eng,Journal of clinical & translational endocrinology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Thus, an urgent need exists to find ways to combat resistant pathogens. One promising approach to overcoming bacterial resistance is the use of herbal products. Green tea catechins, the major green tea polyphenols, show antimicrobial activity against resistant pathogens. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of catechins, green tea extract, and methylxanthines in combination with gentamicin against standard and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and the standard strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).--NEW SECTION--The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of different agents against bacterial strains were determined. The interactions of green tea extract, epigallate catechin, epigallocatechin gallate, two types of methylxanthine, caffeine, and theophylline with gentamicin were studied in vitro by using a checkerboard method and calculating the fraction inhibitory concentration index (FICI).--NEW SECTION--The MICs of gentamicin against bacterial strains were in the range of 0.312 - 320 μg/mL. The MIC values of both types of catechins were 62.5 - 250 μg/ mL. Green tea extract showed insufficient antibacterial activity when used alone. Methylxanthines had no intrinsic inhibitory activity against any of the bacterial strains tested. When green tea extract and catechins were combined with gentamicin, the MIC values of gentamicin against the standard strains and a clinical isolate were reduced, and synergistic activities were observed (FICI < 1). A combination of caffeine with gentamicin did not alter the MIC values of gentamicin.--NEW SECTION--The results of the present study revealed that green tea extract and catechins potentiated the antimicrobial action of gentamicin against some clinical isolates of S. aureus and standard P. aeruginosa strains. Therefore, combinations of gentamicin with these natural compounds might be a promising approach to combat microbial resistance.",eng,Journal of pharmacopuncture,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

28089404,10.1016/j.ijotn.2016.12.001,The SCHHS hip fracture clinical network experience-Improving care and outcomes through an interprofessional approach.,"Hip fractures are a major global health care issue, with the 1.26 million estimated cases in 1990 predicted to increase to 4.5 million by 2050. Varying models of care have been developed to improve outcomes following fragility hip fractures. Most of these care models embrace an interprofessional approach to care. Specialist orthopedic nurses play an important role in the management of fragility hip fracture patients and their contribution to the interprofessional health care team is an important predictor of patient outcomes.--NEW SECTION--The Sunshine Coast Hospital and Health Service (SCHHS) is compromised of four hospitals in South East Queensland, Australia however only one large regional hospital provides specialist hip fracture services. Approximately, 350 older hip fracture patients present to the Sunshine Coast Hospital & Health Service (SCHHS) each year. We used Hospital Health round table (HHRT) data to identify and assess key performance care and management of hip fracture patient and outcomes at SCHHS. The HHRT is a nonprofit membership organisation of health services across Australia and New Zealand that aims to provide opportunity for Health Services to achieve best practice, collect analyse and publish information, identify ways to improve and promote collaboration and networking. Exemplars of best practice are also identified in the data so that organizations can adopt similar models of care. HHRT data identified underperformance in management of hip fracture patients in a number of quality indicators at the study site, including length of stay (LOS), time to surgery and relative stay index (RSI).--NEW SECTION--Following review of HHRT data key stakeholders undertook a quality improvement project and formed the Hip Fracture Clinical Network Group (HFCNG). This was established in 2013 with the aim of improving outcomes and achieving key performance indicators for all elderly patients who sustain a hip fracture through active collaboration and regular communication between a broad group of key clinical stakeholders.--NEW SECTION--Following the implementation of the initiative the Relative Stay Index reduced from 88% in 2012/13 to 78% in 2014/15, and the average LOS reduced from 10.4 days to 8.6 days. The percentage of patients receiving surgery within 2 days rose from 85% to 96%; demonstrating consistent outperformance of the time to surgery key performance indicator of 80%. The percentage of patients discharged to their place of usual residence increased from 45% to 54%. The rate of complications reduced slightly from 69% to 66%. Rates of hospital acquired anaemia reduced from 20.7% to 15%. Detection of delirium rose over the reporting period from 22% to 34%, enabling rapid management. We noted during this period that there was no corresponding increase in readmission rates for this group of patients. These data reflect improvement to clinical documentation and the appropriate identification of cognitive changes.--NEW SECTION--In this quality improvement report, we describe how key stakeholders were engaged to improve communication and collaboration, and how the use of a national benchmarking dataset enabled health care providers to identify care gaps and inconsistencies in clinical practice. This quality improvement project markedly improved collaboration, clinical practice and patient outcomes.",eng,International journal of orthopaedic and trauma nursing,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

The present exploratory and descriptive retrospective analysis assessed the quality of life (QoL) of CRYSTAL study patients with RAS wt mCRC-the labeled indication for cetuximab in many countries.--NEW SECTION--Patient QoL was investigated using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL questionnaire core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). QoL assessments were performed at baseline, after every 8 weeks of treatment, and at the final tumor assessment. RAS wt patients were considered evaluable for QoL if they had provided ≥ 1 evaluable EORTC QLQ-C30.--NEW SECTION--Of the 367 patients with RAS wt tumors, 351 were evaluable for QoL. Global health status (GHS)/QoL and the time to worsening of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status were similar between the treatment groups. However, the analysis was complicated by a large decrease in the number of evaluable patients in the FOLFIRI arm between weeks 32 and 40. The individual dimensions of interest in mCRC (eg, social functioning, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and functional difficulties) were also similar between the treatment arms. Changes in GHS/QoL and social functioning from baseline to week 8 were similar, irrespective of whether patients experienced early skin reactions.--NEW SECTION--The findings of the present descriptive retrospective analysis suggest that adding cetuximab to first-line FOLFIRI improves PFS, OS, and ORR without negatively affecting the QoL of CRYSTAL study patients with RAS wt mCRC.",eng,Clinical colorectal cancer,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017
28077739,10.4269/ajtmh.16-0687,The Emergence of Undergraduate Majors in Global Health: Systematic Review of Programs and Recommendations for Future Directions.,"Global health education has been expanding rapidly and several universities have created an undergraduate major degree (bachelor's degree) in global heath or global health studies. Because there are currently no national guidelines for undergraduate degrees in global health, each of these programs was developed along individual lines. To guide the development of future global health majors, we conducted a systematic review of undergraduate majors in global health. We identified eight programs and invited program directors or representatives to a symposium at the Consortium of Universities for Global Health 2016 conference to review their existing undergraduate major in global health and to discuss lessons learned and recommendations for other colleges and universities seeking to develop undergraduate degrees in global health. We noted significant diversity among the existing programs in terms of required courses, international field experiences, and thesis research projects. In this review, we describe these global health programs, their student characteristics, as well as the key educational competencies, program requirements, and core global health courses. Based on program reviews and discussions, we identify seven recommendations for the development and expansion of an undergraduate major in global health and discuss issues that have arisen in the curricular development of these programs that warrant further exploration. As the field of global health education continues to expand, following these students after graduation will be essential to ensure that the degree programs in global health both meet student needs and launch students on viable career pathways.",eng,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

The secondary aim was to explore H&N cancer patients' HRQoL and perceived information.--NEW SECTION--H&N cancer patients were identified via the Swedish Cancer Register. Data were collected using the following questionnaires; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C-30, INFO25, and a study-specific questionnaire.--NEW SECTION--Out of 289 patients, 203 (70%) responded and among these, 43 (21%) reported being referred to palliative care. Global health was the lowest reported functional scale (median score = 67) and fatigue (median scores 33) the highest reported symptom (QLQ C-30). Patients with a written care plan were significantly more satisfied with information regarding self-care compared to patients without a care plan. Patients referred to palliative care were less satisfied with information regarding disease (p < 0.000), the spread of the disease (p < 0.001) and were more likely to visit hospital emergency departments (43% vs. 19% p < 0.000).--NEW SECTION--To avoid H&N cancer care in silos, a closer integration between the oncology and the palliative care team is needed.

28066758,10.3389/fpubh.2016.00280,Global Health and Visa Policy Reform to Address Dangers of Hajj during Summer Seasons.,"Every year on the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, 2-3 million Muslims from over 160 countries migrate to Holy sites in Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj, representing one of the largest mass gathering events worldwide. Yet, the Hajj poses several challenges to global health and public safety, including the unique health risks posed by seasonal variability when Hajj occurs during summer months. Specifically, pilgrims taking the journey to Mecca are at higher risk for heat illnesses, heat-related injuries and exhaustion, and stampedes, when summer temperatures can reach up to 48.7°C. In response, we propose that the Saudi government, in coordination with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the World Health Organization, explore the establishment of an expert committee, create and use a predictive risk modeling tool, and establish a dynamic quota on Hajj visas to limit potential heat exposure for high-risk populations when the Hajj falls on seasons associated with extreme weather exposure. As climate change is projected to lead to future increases in temperatures in the region, this form of dynamic and evidence-based policymaking is needed to ensure human health and safety for generations of Hajj pilgrims to come.",eng,Frontiers in public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence the occurrence of maternal deaths in a regional maternity hospital in Kuando Kubango province of Angola.--NEW SECTION--The study was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of case notes of all maternal deaths and deliveries that were recorded from 2010 to 2014. The information collected included data on pregnancy, labor and post-natal period retrieved from case notes and the delivery register.--NEW SECTION--During the period under study, a total of 7,158 live births were conducted out of which 131 resulted in maternal death with an overall maternal mortality ratio of 1,830 per 100,000 live births. The causes of death and their importance was relatively similar over the period reviewed. The direct obstetric causes accounted for 51% of all deaths. The major causes were hemorrhage (15%), puerperal sepsis (13%), eclampsia (11%) and ruptured uterus (10%). In addition, indirect non-obstetric medical causes such as Malaria, Anemia, hepatitis, AIDs and cardiovascular diseases accounted for 49% of all maternal deaths. There is poor documentation of personal data and clinical case management of cases. The factors of mutual instability of statistical significance associated with maternal death are: place of domicile (P=0.0001) and distance to the hospital (P=0.0001).--NEW SECTION--The study demonstrated that the MMR in maternity hospital is very high and is higher than the WHO 2014 estimates and the province is yet to achieve the desired MDG 5 target by the end of 2015. A reversal of the present state requires data driven planning in order to improve access and use of Maternal Health Services (MHS) and ultimately lower the number of pregnancy-related maternal deaths.",eng,International journal of MCH and AIDS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This study assesses the adolescents' knowledge, attitude and utilization of emergency contraceptive pills (ECP) in Amassoma Community, Bayelsa State, in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.--NEW SECTION--The study was a descriptive cross-sectional research design. A purposive sampling technique was used to select a sample of 220 respondents from the target population. Data were collected using a self-structured questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data generated.--NEW SECTION--Majority of the respondents had high level of knowledge and positive attitude towards emergency contraceptive pills but had low level of utilization. Concerns about what others may say, parental attitude, contraceptive availability, contraceptive accessibility, and peer influences were the major factors that influenced the utilization of contraceptive pills. There was no significant relationship between knowledge and utilization of emergency contraceptive pills, as well as level of knowledge and their utilization of emergency contraceptive pills.--NEW SECTION--Adolescents in the study were more likely to use emergency contraceptive pills, if parents and others reaction to adolescents' contraceptive use were positive about those.

Despite the fact that the majority of the Uganda population is rural and the major obstetrical care provider is the midwife, there is a lack of data in the literature regarding rural health facilities' and midwives' knowledge of ultrasound technology and perspectives on important maternal health issues such as deficiencies in prenatal services.--NEW SECTION--A survey of the current antenatal diagnostic and management capabilities of midwives at 12 rural Ugandan health facilities was performed as part of an international program initiated to provide ultrasound machines and formal training in their use to midwives at antenatal care clinics.--NEW SECTION--The survey revealed that the majority of pregnant women attend less than the recommended minimum of four antenatal care visits. There were significant knowledge deficits in many prenatal conditions that require ultrasound for early diagnosis, such as placenta previa and macrosomia. The cost of providing ultrasound machines and formal training to 12 midwives was $6,888 per powered rural health facility and $8,288 for non-powered rural health facilities in which solar power was required to maintain ultrasound.--NEW SECTION--In order to more successfully meet Millennium Development Goal 4 (reduce child mortality), 5 (improve maternal health) and 6 (combat HIV) through decreasing maternal to child transmission of HIV, the primary healthcare provider, which is the midwife in Uganda, must be competent at the diagnosis and management of a wide spectrum of obstetrical challenges.

A total number of 8,963 dengue cases with 0.4% case fatality ratio were registered during the outbreak.--NEW SECTION--A sample size of 354 respondents were proportionally allocated to each residential colony and then randomly selected. The association of independent variable (Community participation) and dependent variable (practices for control) were tested by using Chi Square test.--NEW SECTION--Results regarding perception of practices for dengue control with community participation showed that: practices for control had significant association with organization of people to eradicate dengue mosquitoes (p=0.00), community leaders (p=0.04), community efforts (p≤0.01), use of insecticides by community people (p=0.00) and involvement of community people in awareness campaign (p=0.00). Similarly, significant associations were found between practices for control and community shared information during dengue outbreak (p=0.00), community link with health department, NGO, Other agencies (p=0.02).--NEW SECTION--We conclude that the spread of dengue epidemic was aided by the ignorance, laziness of the community people and government agencies. However, the people, religious scholars, leaders and government agencies were not organized to participate in dengue prevention and eradication, hence, the chances of dengue infection increased in community.

Disposal of these inflammatory cells is the key to disease control. Eosinophilic airway inflammation is responsive to corticosteroid treatment, whereas neutrophilic inflammation is resistant and increases the burden of global health care. Corticosteroid-resistant neutrophilic asthma remains mechanistically poorly understood and requires novel effective therapeutic strategies.--NEW SECTION--We sought to explore the underlying mechanisms of airway inflammation persistence, as well as corticosteroid resistance, and to investigate a new strategy of effective treatment against corticosteroid-insensitive neutrophilic asthma.--NEW SECTION--Mouse models of either eosinophil-dominated or neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation were used in this study to test corticosteroid sensitivity in vivo and in vitro. We also used vav-Bcl-2 transgenic mice to confirm the importance of granulocytes apoptosis in the clearance of airway inflammation. Finally, the Bcl-2 inhibitors ABT-737 or ABT-199 were tested for their therapeutic effects against eosinophilic or neutrophilic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness.--NEW SECTION--Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein was found to be responsible for persistence of granulocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after allergic challenge. This was important because allergen-induced airway inflammation aggravated and persisted in vav-Bcl-2 transgenic mice, in which nucleated hematopoietic cells were overexpressed with Bcl-2 and resistant to apoptosis. The Bcl-2 inhibitors ABT-737 or ABT-199 play efficient roles in alleviation of either eosinophilic or corticosteroid-resistant neutrophilic airway inflammation by inducing apoptosis of immune cells, such as eosinophils, neutrophils, TH2 cells, TH17 cells, and dendritic cells. Moreover, these inhibitors were found to be more efficient than steroids to induce granulocyte apoptosis ex vivo from patients with severe asthma.--NEW SECTION--Apoptosis of inflammatory cells is essential for clearance of allergen-induced airway inflammation. The Bcl-2 inhibitors ABT-737 or ABT-199 might be promising drugs for the treatment of airway inflammation, especially for corticosteroid-insensitive neutrophilic airway inflammation.",eng,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

This is an encouraging statistic; however, it will not achieve the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating TB by 2050, and it is being compounded by the persistent global incidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) acquired by transmission and by treatment pressure. One key to effectively control tuberculosis and the spread of multiresistant strains is accurate information pertaining to drug resistance and susceptibility. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has the potential to effectively change global health and the management of TB. Industry has focused primarily on using NGS for oncology diagnostics and human genomics, but the area in which NGS can rapidly impact health care is in the area of infectious disease diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries. To date, there has been a failure as a community to capitalize on the potential of NGS, especially at the reference laboratory level where it can provide actionable information pertaining to treatment options for patients. The rapid evolution of knowledge about the genetic foundations of tuberculosis drug resistance makes sequencing a versatile technology platform for providing rapid, accurate, and actionable results for treating this disease. No ""plug-and-play"" and ""end-to-end"" NGS solutions exist that provide clinically relevant sequence data from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex genome from primary clinical samples (e.g., sputum) in high-burden country reference laboratories, which is where they are most needed. However, such a system-based solution is underdeveloped by Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics (FIND), in collaboration with partners from academia, nongovernmental organizations, and industry. The solution is modular and is designed and developed to perform targeted amplicon sequencing directly from a patient's primary sputum sample. This solution will initially allow reference laboratories to perform reflex NGS that provides a rapid and comprehensive analysis of a patient's M. tuberculosis complex drug resistance profile, thereby facilitating optimization of a patient's treatment, improving treatment outcomes, and reducing the spread of DR-TB. Such a system could also enable countries to implement culture-free drug resistance surveillance programs, which could bypass the need for expensive culture facilities, decrease a country's dependence on external laboratories, and significantly expand the map of global surveillance capabilities. In addition, the introduction of such a system will provide a foundation for NGS to be used for genotypic testing for human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, surveillance of other diseases, in-country capability for outbreak discovery and management, and a host of other diagnostic benefits that are currently limited to high-income countries.",eng,International journal of mycobacteriology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The association between tobacco smoke and TB has already been studied. Water-pipe smoking has become an increasing problem not only in Middle Eastern countries but also globally as it is considered by users as being safer than cigarettes. The presence of high levels of toxic substances in water-pipe smoke may be predisposing factors that enhance the incidence of pulmonary disorders in water-pipe smokers. For example, uncontrolled macropinocytosis occurs in alveolar epithelial cells following exposure to water-pipe smoke, which may predispose individuals to pulmonary infection. In this work, we studied the effects of water-pipe condense (WPC) on the internalization of Mycobacterium bovis (bacillus Calmette-Guérin [BCG]) by macropinocytosis in Type II alveolar epithelial cells (A549).--NEW SECTION--A549 cells were treated by WPC (4mg/mL) for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h, respectively. The effect on cell proliferation was studied using a methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay. Cells were exposed to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (1mg/mL; control) and FITC-BCG (multiplicity of infection, 10) for 20min at 37°C before their collection and the uptake of BCG-FITC was determined by flow cytometry. Similar experiments were performed at 4°C as a control.--NEW SECTION--WPC (4mg/mL) after 72h (1.4±0.2-fold, p<0.05) and 96h (1.6±0.2-fold, p<0.05) hours increased the uptake of BCG-FITC. No effect on BCG-FITC uptake was observed at 24h or 48h. WPC also significantly increased the uptake of FITC-dextran (2.9±0.3-fold, p<0.05) after 96h. WPC also significantly decreased cell proliferation after 24h (84±2%), 48h (78±3%), 72h (64±2%, p<0.05), and 96h (45±2%, p<0.05).--NEW SECTION--WPC exposure increased epithelial cells' permeability and death and enhanced their capacity for macropinocytosis. Our in vitro data suggest possible harmful effects of WPC on the ability of lung epithelial cells to phagocytose mycobacteria. Further studies will be conducted to understand the mechanism of action of WPC.",eng,International journal of mycobacteriology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

To obtain a WHO recommendation, LNs must undergo prospective monitoring of insecticidal efficacy against mosquito vectors over 3 years of household use. The retention of bioefficacy and physical durability of a LN is influenced by net usage practices, textile polymer material and insecticide treatment technology. Fabric durability is the critical factor which determines the interval required between LN replacement campaigns. To investigate factors known to affect LN durability and bioefficacy, we describe a three-arm WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) Phase III evaluation of a LN made uniquely from polypropylene (LifeNet®, Bayer CropScience) compared to standard LNs made from polyester and polyethylene, all treated with deltamethrin, over 3 years of use.--NEW SECTION--This is a prospective three-arm household randomized, equivalence trial of LNs in Tanzania, with nets as the unit of observation. Equal numbers of houses will be randomized to receive deltamethrin-treated polypropylene, polyester or polyethylene LNs; all sleeping spaces in a given household will be provided with one type of net. Bioefficacy (insecticidal activity against mosquitoes), insecticide content of net fibres, and fabric integrity (number, location and size of holes) will be measured every 6 months, using WHO cone or tunnel bioassays, chemical analysis and calculation of hole index, respectively. A cohort of LNs will be surveyed annually to assess survivorship (median LN survival time) and cumulative loss of fabric integrity. Field durability outcomes will be compared with laboratory strength tests.--NEW SECTION--This is the first trial to compare the relative durability of three LNs each made from a different textile polymer, treated with the same insecticide, in the same community side-by-side over 3 years of use. Trial findings will 1) guide global health organizations on procurement policy and the type of textile polymer which maximizes the interval between LN replacement campaigns, and 2) stimulate manufacturers to improve product performance and development of longer lasting polymers.

In most countries around the world, the alcohol industry is given the opportunity to regulate itself with respect to advertising practices. Generally, the alcohol industry self-regulations are lax, allowing youth to be disproportionately exposed to alcohol advertising. However, Beam Global Spirits and Wine (Beam) voluntarily adopted more restrictive advertising standards in the United States in 2007. This study assessed Beam's compliance with their new standard and estimates its effect on youth exposure and advertising costs. We found that Beam's compliance with its more restrictive standards was imperfect, but never-the-less, we estimated that youth exposure to alcohol advertising was reduced compared to other spirits brands. Beam's more restrictive standards did not increase their advertising costs and therefore other alcohol companies should consider adopting similar standards around the world.",eng,Journal of public affairs,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Why did 47 states impose barriers anyway? This article argues that states use barriers as political cover to prevent a loss of domestic political support. This logic suggests that governments anticipating high domestic political benefits for imposing barriers during an outbreak will be likely to do so. Logistic regression and duration analysis of an original dataset coding state behavior during H1N1 provide support for this argument: democracies with weak health infrastructure-those that stand to gain the most from imposing barriers during an outbreak because they are particularly vulnerable to a negative public reaction-are more likely than others to impose barriers and to do so quickly.",eng,The review of international organizations,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Human health remains at higher risk due to several reported therapeutic failures to many life threatening drug resistant microbial infections. The resultant effects have been prolonged hospital stay, higher cost of alternative therapy, increased mortality, etc. This opinionated review considers the two main concerns in integrated human health risk assessment (i.e., residual antibiotics and antibiotic resistant genes) in various compartments of human environment, as well as clinical dynamics associated with the development and transfer of antibiotic resistance (AR). Contributions of quorum sensing, biofilms, enzyme production, and small colony variants in bacteria, among other factors in soil, water, animal farm and clinical settings were also considered. Every potential factor in environmental and clinical settings that brings about AR needs to be identified for the summative effects in overall resistance. There is a need to embrace coordinated multi-locational approaches and interrelationships to track the emergence of resistance in different niches in soil and water versus the hospital environment. The further integration with advocacy, legislation, enforcement, technological innovations and further research input and recourse to WHO guidelines on antibiotic policy would be advantageous towards addressing the emergence of antibiotic resistant superbugs.",eng,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
28035772,10.1002/hep.28933,Deregulated neddylation in liver fibrosis.,"Hepatic fibrosis is a global health problem currently without effective therapeutic approaches. Even though the ubiquitin-like posttranslational modification of neddylation, that conjugates Nedd8 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated) to specific targets, is aberrant in many pathologies, its relevance in liver fibrosis (LF) remained unexplored. Our results show deregulated neddylation in clinical fibrosis and both in mouse bileductligation- and CCl4 -induced fibrosis. Importantly, neddylation inhibition, by using the pharmacological inhibitor, MLN4924, reduced liver injury, apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis by targeting different hepatic cell types. On one hand, increased neddylation was associated with augmented caspase 3 activity in bile-acid-induced apoptosis in mouse hepatocytes whereas neddylation inhibition ameliorated apoptosis through reduction of expression of the Cxcl1 and Ccl2 chemokines. On the other hand, chemokine receptors and cytokines, usually induced in activated macrophages, were reduced after neddylation inhibition in mouse Kupffer cells. Under these circumstances, decreased hepatocyte cell death and inflammation after neddylation inhibition could partly account for reduction of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. We provide evidence that augmented neddylation characterizes activated HSCs, suggesting that neddylation inhibition could be important for resolving LF by directly targeting these fibrogenic cells. Indeed, neddylation inhibition in activated HSCs induces apoptosis in a process partly mediated by accumulation of c-Jun, whose cullin-mediated degradation is impaired under these circumstances.--NEW SECTION--Neddylation inhibition reduces fibrosis, suggesting neddylation as a potential and attractive therapeutic target in liver fibrosis.

Such an approach presents important opportunities to reduce the impact of disease emergence events and also to mitigate future emergence through improved cross-sectoral coordination. In an attempt to provide proof of concept of the utility of the One Health approach, the US Agency for International Development's PREDICT project consortium designed and implemented a targeted, risk-based surveillance strategy based not on humans as sentinels of disease but on detecting viruses early, at their source, where intervention strategies can be implemented before there is opportunity for spillover and spread in people or food animals. Here, we share One Health approaches used by consortium members to illustrate the potential for successful One Health outcomes that can be achieved through collaborative, transdisciplinary partnerships. PREDICT's collaboration with partners around the world on strengthening local capacity to detect hundreds of viruses in wild animals, coupled with a series of cutting-edge virological and analytical activities, have significantly improved our baseline knowledge on the zoonotic pool of viruses and the risk of exposure to people. Further testament to the success of the project's One Health approach and the work of its team of dedicated One Health professionals are the resulting 90 peer-reviewed, scientific publications in under 5 years that improve our understanding of zoonoses and the factors influencing their emergence. The findings are assisting in global health improvements, including surveillance science, diagnostic technologies, understanding of viral evolution, and ecological driver identification.

However, the literature on respondent-level acceptance of CAPI in LMIC has reported mixed outcomes. This is the first study to prospectively examine female respondent acceptance of CAPI and its influencing factors for MNCH data collection in rural Southwest Uganda.--NEW SECTION--Eighteen women aged 15-49 years were randomly selected from 3 rural villages to participate. Each respondent was administered a Women's Questionnaire with half of the survey questions asked using PAPI techniques and the other half using CAPI. Following this PAPI/CAPI exposure, semi-structured focus group discussions (FGDs) assessed respondent attitudes towards PAPI versus CAPI.

Information was extracted regarding EMR name, organization, scope of use, platform, open source coding, commercial availability, data integration, and capacity for linguistic and decision support. Missing information was requested by email.--NEW SECTION--After screening of 122 abstracts, two articles remained that discussed deployment of EMR systems in MST settings (iChart, SmartList To Go), and thirteen additional EMR systems were found through the Google search. Of these, three systems (Project Buendia, TEBOW, and University of Central Florida's internally developed EMR) are based on modified versions of Open MRS software, while three are smartphone apps (QuickChart EMR, iChart, NotesFirst). Most of the systems use a local network to manage data, while the remaining systems use opportunistic cloud synchronization. Three (TimmyCare, Basil, and Backpack EMR) contain multilingual user interfaces, and only one (QuickChart EMR) contained MST-specific clinical decision support.--NEW SECTION--There have been limited attempts to tailor EMRs to mobile MSTs. Only Open MRS has a broad user base, and other EMR systems should consider interoperability and data sharing with larger systems as a priority. Several systems include tablet compatibility, or are specifically designed for smartphone, which may be helpful given the environment and low resource context. Results from this review may be useful to non-government organizations (NGOs) considering modernization of their medical records practices as EMR use facilitates research, decreases paper administration costs, and improves perceptions of professionalism; however, most MST-specific EMRs remain in their early stages, and further development and research is required before reaching the stage of widespread adoption.",eng,International journal of medical informatics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

In psychiatry, low vitamin D levels have been associated with schizophrenia, depression, psychotic symptoms, and, more recently, alcohol use disorders. Alcohol use disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the association between alcohol use and vitamin D serum levels. The PubMed, SCIELO, and Lilacs databases were searched for this systematic review. We assessed all articles published from 1976 to December 2015, and we examined the associated reference lists to retrieve articles that appeared to fulfill our criteria. Of 932 articles, 49 met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the papers (71.4%) were cross-sectional studies. Alcohol intake was found to be positively associated with vitamin D status in 15 articles and negatively associated with vitamin D in 18 articles; no association was found in 16 articles. Heterogeneous results were found in our review, with a similar number of papers indicating a positive association, a negative association or the absence of any association between alcohol use and vitamin D levels. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the studies in which a positive association was found were more recent papers that involved considerably larger sample sizes than those in other studies. The older studies compared vitamin D levels in alcoholic and non-alcoholic patients, in contrast to more recent studies, which focused on more specific populations. In addition, most of the selected papers were from high latitude countries, where exposure to sunlight tends to be lower than in tropical countries. The data concerning vitamin D levels in patients with alcohol use disorders remain controversial. Additional research using a standardized methodology is necessary to demonstrate the real impact of alcohol consumption on vitamin D serum levels as well as on the health status of alcohol users.",eng,Psychiatry research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Advances in Internet capacity along with the development of reliable portable ultrasounds have created an opportunity to provide centralized remote quality assurance (QA) for ultrasound exams performed at rural sites worldwide. We sought to harness these advances by developing a web-based tool to facilitate QA activities for newly trained sonographers who were taking part in a cluster randomized trial investigating the role of limited obstetric ultrasound to improve pregnancy outcomes in 5 low- and middle-income countries. We were challenged by connectivity issues, by country-specific needs for website usability, and by the overall need for a high-throughput system. After systematically addressing these needs, the resulting QA website helped drive ultrasound quality improvement across all 5 countries.

Since hand involvement and its decreased function are hallmarks of RA, the aim of our study was to investigate the performance of RAPID3 scores with regard to hand function and to confirm previous findings that the RAPID3 score as a disease activity measure is strongly correlated with the DAS28 score. Sixty-eight consecutive patients with RA (85% female), aged 18-75 years, were included in the study and were recruited during their outpatient visit. Apart from demographic and clinical data, the obtained parameters of interest included RAPID3 scores and assessments of the function of the hand, namely, the signal of functional impairment (SOFI)-hand, grip strength, and pulp-to-palm distance, as well the Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and DAS28 scores. Pearson's correlation coefficient, Student's t test and linear regression were used in the statistical analysis of the results. The significance was set to p < 0.05. A positive correlation was found between RAPID3 scores and HAQ-DI scores, SOFI-hand scores, and pulp-to-palm distance, and negative correlation was observed between RAPID3 scores and grip strength. The order regarding the strength of correlations between RAPID3 scores and other variables (from the strongest to the weakest) was as follows: HAQ-DI, grip strength, SOFI-hand and pulp-to-palm distance. The hand assessment variables had stronger correlations with RAPID3 scores than with DAS28 scores. Our preliminary study showed that RAPID3 scores were strongly correlated with measurements of the functional ability of the hand, demonstrating that RAPID3 can be used as a measure of disease activity in clinical practice and to characterize hand function.

While such funds can enable urgently-needed research and interventions, they can carry the risk of skewing health research priorities and exacerbating health inequities. With the objective of promoting critical reflection on potential corporate funding options for global health research, we propose a set of three questions developed through an open conference workshop and reflection on experiences of global health researchers and their institutions: 1) Does this funding allow me/us to retain control over research design, methodology and dissemination processes? 2) Does accessing this funding source involve altering my/our research agenda (i.e., what is the impact of this funding source on research priorities)? 3) What are the potential ""unintended consequences"" of accepting corporate funding, in terms of legitimizing corporations or models of development that are at the root of many global health problems?

Descriptive statistics and a thematic analysis were performed on the data and results were discussed in comparison with recommendations found in the literature.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-three programs responded to the survey. Student selection processes varied across universities; examples included using academic performance, interviews and motivation letters. All but one MD program had mandatory PDT; content and teaching formats varied, as did training duration (2-38 hours). All but one MD program had onsite supervision; local clinicians were frequently involved. Debriefing, although not systematic, covered similar content; debriefing was variable in duration (1-8 hours).--NEW SECTION--Many current practices are encouraging, but areas for improvement exist.

Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Tertiary public referral hospital in Eldoret, Kenya. Subjects and Methods Twenty-one patients were enrolled during the study period. A retrospective chart review was performed for all adult patients who underwent thyroid surgery during humanitarian trips (2010-2015). Patients were contacted by mobile telephone. Medical history and physical examination, including laryngoscopy, were performed, and the SF-36 was administered (a quality-of-life questionnaire). Laboratory measurements of thyroid function and neck ultrasound were obtained. Results The mean follow-up was 33.6 ± 20.2 months after surgery: 37.5% of subtotal thyroidectomy patients and 15.4% of lobectomy patients were hypothyroid postoperatively according to serologic studies. There were no cases of goiter recurrence or malignancy. All patients reported postoperative symptomatic improvement and collectively showed positive pre- and postoperative score differences on the SF-36. Conclusion Although limited by a small sample size and the retrospective nature, our study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term surgical and quality-of-life outcomes research in a resource-limited setting. The low complication rates suggest minimal adverse effects of performing surgery in this context. Despite a considerable rate of postoperative hypothyroidism, it is in accordance with prior studies and emphasizes the need for individualized, longitudinal, and multidisciplinary care.

However, the effects of cadmium and lead exposure, as well as the levels of DNA hypomethylation, on UC risk are limited. We evaluated the possible exposure sources of Cd and Pb and the relationship among DNA hypomethylation, urinary Cd and Pb levels, and UC risk. We recruited 209 patients with UC and 417 control patients for a hospital-based case-control study between June 2011 and August 2014. We collected environmental exposure-related information with questionnaires. Blood and urine samples were analyzed to measure the Cd and Pb exposure and 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine levels as a proxy for DNA methylation. Multivariate logistic regression and 95% confidence intervals were applied to estimate the risk for UC. Study participants with high Cd and Pb exposure in blood or urine had significantly increased risk of UC, especially among the smokers. After adjusting for age and gender, the possible connections of individual cumulative cigarette smoking or herb medicine exposure with the increased levels of Cd and Pb were observed in the controls. Participants with 8.66%-12.39% of DNA hypomethylation had significantly increased risk of UC compared with those with ≥12.39% of DNA hypomethylation.

While development policies linking human rights with access to sexual and reproductive healthcare have yielded progress towards improving the status of women and girls, older women have not benefited from these initiatives. Yet as women grow older, they experience a range of health conditions rooted in their reproductive biology - from ageing with fistula, to cervical and breast cancers. Current approaches to global women's health ignore these serious conditions, harming older women through the perpetuation of gender norms that construe women's health through a narrow reproductive lens. Meanwhile, older women are generally absent from global ageing discourse, which lacks a gender perspective, creating a dual invisibility as the field of global women's health presumes ageing women are accounted for.

Case study research was undertaken with the Future Health Systems consortium, performs research to improve health service delivery for the poor in Bangladesh, China, India, and Uganda. Data were thematically analysed and revealed that proposed ethical requirements for sharing sovereignty and sharing resources are largely upheld by Future Health Systems. Facilitating factors included having a decentralised governance model, LMIC partners with good research capacity, and firm budgets. Higher labour costs in the US and UK and the funder's policy of allocating funds to consortia on a reimbursement basis prevented full alignment with guidance on sharing resources.

The only available licensed vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, does not confer lifelong protection against active TB. To date, development of an effective vaccine against TB has proven to be elusive, and devising newer approaches for improved vaccination outcomes is an essential goal. Insights gained over the last several years have revealed multiple mechanisms of immune manipulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in infected macrophages and dendritic cells that support disease progression and block development of protective immunity. This review provides an assessment of the known immunoregulatory mechanisms altered by Mtb, and how new interventions may reverse these effects. Examples include blocking of inhibitory immune cell coreceptor checkpoints (e.g., programed death-1). Conversely, immune mechanisms that strengthen immune cell effector functions may be enhanced by interventions, including stimulatory immune cell coreceptors (e.g., OX40). Modification of the activity of key cell ""immunometabolism"" signaling pathway molecules, including mechanistic target of rapamycin, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, wnt/β-catenin, adenosine monophosophate-activated protein kinase, and sirtuins, related epigenetic changes, and preventing induction of immune regulatory cells (e.g., regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells) are powerful new approaches to improve vaccine responses. Interventions to favorably modulate these components have been studied primarily in oncology to induce efficient antitumor immune responses, often by potentiation of cancer vaccines. These agents include antibodies and a rapidly increasing number of small molecule drug classes that have contributed to the dramatic immune-based advances in treatment of cancer and other diseases. Because immune responses to malignancies and to Mtb share many similar mechanisms, studies to improve TB vaccine responses using interventions based on ""immuno-oncology"" are needed to guide possible repurposing. Understanding the regulation of immune cell functions appropriated by Mtb to promote the imbalance between protective and pathogenic immune responses may guide the development of innovative drug-based adjunct approaches to substantially enhance the clinical efficacy of TB vaccines.",eng,Frontiers in immunology,Review,2025-04-23,2016
28018255,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01906,An Affective Neuroscience Framework for the Molecular Study of Internet Addiction.,"Internet addiction represents an emerging global health issue. Increasing efforts have been made to characterize risk factors for the development of Internet addiction and consequences of excessive Internet use. During the last years, classic research approaches from psychology considering personality variables as vulnerability factor, especially in conjunction with neuroscience approaches such as brain imaging, have led to coherent theoretical conceptualizations of Internet addiction. Although such conceptualizations can be valuable aid, the research field is currently lacking a comprehensive framework for determining brain-based and neurochemical markers of Internet addiction. The present work aims at providing a framework on the molecular level as a basis for future research on the neural and behavioral level, in order to facilitate a comprehensive neurobiological model of Internet addiction and its clinical symptomatology. To help establish such a molecular framework for the study of Internet addiction, we investigated in N = 680 participants associations between individual differences in tendencies toward Internet addiction measured by the Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale-2 (GPIUS-2) and individual differences in primary emotional systems as assessed by the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS). Regression analysis revealed that the ANPS scales FEAR and SADNESS were the ANPS scales most robustly positively linked to several (sub)scales of the GPIUS-2. Also the scales SEEKING, CARE and PLAY explain variance in some of the GPIUS-2 subscales. As such, these scales are negatively linked to the GPIUS-2 subscales. As the ANPS has been constructed on substantial available brain data including an extensive molecular body with respect to evolutionary highly conserved emotional circuitry in the ancient mammalian brain, the present study gives first ideas on putative molecular mechanisms underlying different facets of Internet addiction as derived from associations between tendencies toward Internet addiction and individual differences in primary emotional systems. For example, as SADNESS is linked to the overall GPIUS-2 score, and the neuropeptide oxytocin is known to downregulate SADNESS, it is conceivable that the neuropeptide might play a role in Internet addition on the molecular level. Our findings provide a theoretical framework potentially illuminating the molecular underpinnings of Internet addiction. Finally, we also present data on the ANPS and smartphone addiction at the end of the paper. Similar to the reported associations between the ANPS and the GPIUS-2, these correlations might provide an initial outline for a framework guiding future studies that aim to address the molecular basis of smartphone addiction.",eng,Frontiers in psychology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Through lectures and workshops, participants reached a consensus that Multi-Criteria-Decision-Analysis is a method suited to systematically account for the many variables needed to evaluate the broad benefits of vaccination, which include not only health system savings, but also societal benefits, including benefits to the family and increased productivity. Participants also agreed on a set of ""core values"" to be used in future assessments of vaccines for development and introduction. These values include measures of vaccine efficacy and safety, incident cases prevented per year, the results of cost-benefit analyses, preventable mortality, and the severity of the target disease. Agreement on this set of core assessment parameters has the potential to increase alignment between manufacturers, public health agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and policy makers (see Global Health 2035 Mission Grand Convergence [1]).

28017435,10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.086,Informing vaccine decision-making: A strategic multi-attribute ranking tool for vaccines-SMART Vaccines 2.0.,"SMART Vaccines 2.0 software is being developed to support decision-making among multiple stakeholders in the process of prioritizing investments to optimize the outcomes of vaccine development and deployment. Vaccines and associated vaccination programs are one of the most successful and effective public health interventions to prevent communicable diseases and vaccine researchers are continually working towards expanding targets for communicable and non-communicable diseases through preventive and therapeutic modes. A growing body of evidence on emerging vaccine technologies, trends in disease burden, costs associated with vaccine development and deployment, and benefits derived from disease prevention through vaccination and a range of other factors can inform decision-making and investment in new and improved vaccines and targeted utilization of already existing vaccines. Recognizing that an array of inputs influences these decisions, the strategic multi-attribute ranking method for vaccines (SMART Vaccines 2.0) is in development as a web-based tool-modified from a U.S. Institute of Medicine Committee effort (IOM, 2015)-to highlight data needs and create transparency to facilitate dialogue and information-sharing among decision-makers and to optimize the investment of resources leading to improved health outcomes. Current development efforts of the SMART Vaccines 2.0 framework seek to generate a weighted recommendation on vaccine development or vaccination priorities based on population, disease, economic, and vaccine-specific data in combination with individual preference and weights of user-selected attributes incorporating valuations of health, economics, demographics, public concern, scientific and business, programmatic, and political considerations. Further development of the design and utility of the tool is being carried out by the National Vaccine Program Office of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health.

Despite a relatively small number of Ebola-related cases and deaths (compared to other causes), Ebola vaccines suddenly leapt to highest priority among international health agencies and vaccine developers. Clearly, earlier cost-effectiveness analyses badly missed some factors affecting real world decisions. Multi-criteria systems analysis can improve evaluation and prioritization of vaccine development and also of many other health policy and investment decisions. Neither cost-effectiveness nor cost-benefit analysis can capture important aspects of problems such as Ebola or the emerging threat of Zika, especially issues of inequality and disparity-issues that dominate the planning of many global health and economic organizations. Cost-benefit analysis requires assumptions about the specific value of life-an idea objectionable to many analysts and policy makers. Additionally, standard cost-effectiveness calculations cannot generally capture effects on people uninfected with Ebola for example, but nevertheless affected through such factors as contagion, herd immunity, and fear of dread disease, reduction of travel and commerce, and even the hope of disease eradication. Using SMART Vaccines, we demonstrate how systems analysis can visibly include important ""other factors"" and more usefully guide decision making and beneficially alter priority setting processes.",eng,Vaccine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Exposure to arsenic, mostly via drinking water, has been associated with cancer of skin, lungs, and blood, in addition to several kinds of skin lesions. The present study focused on the effect of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on normal skin fibroblast cells. Specifically, the effect of As2O3 on ROS generation and oxidative stress was investigated. Proteins involved in the DNA damage signaling pathway and cell cycle were also studied. As2O3 induced the generation of intracellular ROS. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed a dose-dependent increase in the number of 8-OHdG-positive cells, an indication of oxidative stress. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that As2O3 caused a significant percentage of cells to accumulate in the G0/G1 phase with a concomitant reduction in the S phase. Increases in the activated forms of DNA damage signaling proteins, ATM and ATR, and their effector molecules, Chk2 and p53, were also observed. In addition, expression of oncogene p21 was also increased. The study shows that exposure of normal skin fibroblast cells to As2O3 could lead to cell cycle arrest through ATM/ATR and DNA damage signaling pathways. In conclusion, we report here that arsenic trioxide increases cellular oxidative stress leading to shift in cell cycle and leads to DNA damage through ATM/ATR and the CHK-dependent signaling pathway.",eng,Environmental science and pollution research international,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Despite their rising popularity in the U.S., little research has examined the patterns of spousal concordance (SC) for alternative tobacco products (ATPs), such as e-cigarettes, cigars, and hookah.--NEW SECTION--The purpose of this project was to examine the roles of age, gender, and culture in the strength of SC for these ATPs. Analyses focused on a diverse community sample of married individuals in Ohio, U.S. (N=278), but also examined patterns in Austria, Greece, Israel, the Netherlands, and Slovakia. All participants completed a survey in which they indicated both their own, and their spouse's ever-use of various tobacco products.--NEW SECTION--For the U.S. sample, SC was highest for e-cigarettes, flavored e-cigarettes, flavored cigarettes, and hookah (ϕs=0.48- 0.61); SC appeared to be stronger among younger couples, and when there was only a small female vs. male differences in use. Similar patterns were found in the other countries, with a few key exceptions. In particular, there was low SC for e-cigarettes and flavored e-cigarettes in the other countries, where e-cigarettes had been federally regulated by the time of data collection.--NEW SECTION--Overall, these findings have implications for the continued spreading popularity of these tobacco use behaviors.",eng,Drug and alcohol dependence,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

HRQOL was prospectively assessed preoperatively, after 3 and 12 months, using the QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The impact of complex perioperative treatment courses including cases requiring surgical re-interventions was retrospectively assessed using Martin criteria and the Clavien-Dindo scale. Urinary continence was determined using the validated ICIQ-SF questionnaire. Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Spearman's rank correlation, and ordinal regression models (p < 0.05).--NEW SECTION--A total of 100 patients underwent further analysis.

28008422,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.10036.2,Pathogenic mycobacteria achieve cellular persistence by inhibiting the Niemann-Pick Type C disease cellular pathway.,"Tuberculosis remains a major global health concern. The ability to prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion is a key mechanism by which intracellular mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, achieve long-term persistence within host cells. The mechanisms underpinning this key intracellular pro-survival strategy remain incompletely understood. Host macrophages infected with persistent mycobacteria share phenotypic similarities with cells taken from patients suffering from Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC), a rare lysosomal storage disease in which endocytic trafficking defects and lipid accumulation within the lysosome lead to cell dysfunction and cell death. We investigated whether these shared phenotypes reflected an underlying mechanistic connection between mycobacterial intracellular persistence and the host cell pathway dysfunctional in NPC.--NEW SECTION--The induction of NPC phenotypes in macrophages from wild-type mice or obtained from healthy human donors was assessed via infection with mycobacteria and subsequent measurement of lipid levels and intracellular calcium homeostasis. The effect of NPC therapeutics on intracellular mycobacterial load was also assessed.--NEW SECTION--Macrophages infected with persistent intracellular mycobacteria phenocopied NPC cells, exhibiting accumulation of multiple lipid types, reduced lysosomal Ca2+ levels, and defects in intracellular trafficking. These NPC phenotypes could also be induced using only lipids/glycomycolates from the mycobacterial cell wall. These data suggest that persistent intracellular mycobacteria inhibit the NPC pathway, likely via inhibition of the NPC1 protein, and subsequently induce altered acidic store Ca2+ homeostasis. Reduced lysosomal calcium levels may provide a mechanistic explanation for the reduced levels of phagosome-lysosome fusion in mycobacterial infection. Treatments capable of correcting defects in NPC mutant cells via modulation of host cell calcium were of benefit in promoting clearance of mycobacteria from infected host cells.--NEW SECTION--These findings provide a novel mechanistic explanation for mycobacterial intracellular persistence, and suggest that targeting interactions between the mycobacteria and host cell pathways may provide a novel avenue for development of anti-TB therapies.",eng,Wellcome open research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This is a serious global health problem because arsenic is a Group 1 (proven) human carcinogen and chronic exposure is known to cause skin, lung, and bladder tumors. Furthermore, arsenic exposure can result in a myriad of other adverse health effects including diseases of the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, reproductive, and endocrine systems. In addition to chronic environmental exposure to arsenic, arsenic trioxide is approved for the clinical treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, and is in clinical trials for other hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors. Considerable inter-individual variability in susceptibility to arsenic-induced disease and toxicity exists, and the reasons for such differences are incompletely understood. Transport pathways that influence the cellular uptake and export of arsenic contribute to regulating its cellular, tissue, and ultimately body levels. In the current review, membrane proteins (including phosphate transporters, aquaglyceroporin channels, solute carrier proteins, and ATP-binding cassette transporters) shown experimentally to contribute to the passage of inorganic, methylated, and/or glutathionylated arsenic species across cellular membranes are discussed. Furthermore, what is known about arsenic transporters in organs involved in absorption, distribution, and metabolism and how transport pathways contribute to arsenic elimination are described.",eng,Journal of environmental sciences (China),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, there has been no systematic attempt to characterize the literature and its evolution.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies reporting cost-per-DALY averted from 2000 through 2015. We developed the Global Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (GHCEA) Registry, a repository of English-language cost-per-DALY averted studies indexed in PubMed. To identify candidate studies, we searched PubMed for articles with titles or abstracts containing the phrases ""disability-adjusted"" or ""DALY"". Two reviewers with training in health economics independently reviewed each article selected in our abstract review, gathering information using a standardized data collection form. We summarized descriptive characteristics on study methodology: e.g., intervention type, country of study, study funder, study perspective, along with methodological and reporting practices over two time periods: 2000-2009 and 2010-2015. We analyzed the types of costs included in analyses, the study quality on a scale from 1 (low) to 7 (high), and examined the correlation between diseases researched and the burden of disease in different world regions.--NEW SECTION--We identified 479 cost-per-DALY averted studies published from 2000 through 2015. Studies from Sub-Saharan Africa comprised the largest portion of published studies. The disease areas most commonly studied were communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders (67%), followed by non-communicable diseases (28%). A high proportion of studies evaluated primary prevention strategies (59%). Pharmaceutical interventions were commonly assessed (32%) followed by immunizations (28%). Adherence to good practices for conducting and reporting cost-effectiveness analysis varied considerably. Studies mainly included formal healthcare sector costs. A large number of the studies in Sub-Saharan Africa addressed high-burden conditions such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, neglected tropical diseases and malaria, and diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, meningitis, and other common infectious diseases.--NEW SECTION--The Global Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry reveals a growing and diverse field of cost-per-DALY averted studies.

28005547,10.15171/ijhpm.2016.122,The Legal Strength of International Health Instruments - What It Brings to Global Health Governance?,"Public health instruments have been under constant development and renewal for decades. International legal instruments, with their binding character and strength, have a special place in this development. The start of the 21st century saw, in particular, the birth of the first World Health Organization (WHO)-era health treaties - the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) and its first Protocol. The authors analyze the potential impact of these instruments on global health governance and public health, beyond the traditional view of their impact on tobacco control. Overall, the very fact that globally binding treaties in modern-era health were feasible has accelerated the debate and expectations for an expanded role of international legal regimes in public health. The impact of treaties has also been notable in global health architecture as the novel instruments required novel institutions to govern their implementation. The legal power of the WHO FCTC has enabled rapid adoption of further instruments to promote its implementation, thus, enhancing the international instrumentarium for health, and it has also prompted stronger role for national legislation on health. Notably, the Convention has elevated several traditionally challenging public health features to the level of international legal obligations. It has also revealed how the legal power of the international health instrument can be utilized in safeguarding the interests of health in the face of competing agendas and legal disputes at both the domestic and international levels. Lastly, the legal power of health instruments is associated with their potential impact not only on health but also beyond; the recently adopted Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products may best exemplify this matter. The first treaty experiences of the 21st century may provide important lessons for the role of legal instruments in addressing the unfolding challenges in global health.",eng,International journal of health policy and management,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Yet, there is no efficient vaccine and the immune response remains incompletely understood. Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1), a leading vaccine candidate, plays a key role during merozoite invasion into erythrocytes by interacting with Rhoptry Neck Protein 2 (RON2). We generated a human anti-AMA1-antibody (humAbAMA1) by EBV-transformation of sorted B-lymphocytes from a Ghanaian donor and subsequent rescue of antibody variable regions. The antibody was expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and in HEK239-6E, characterized for binding specificity and epitope, and analyzed for its inhibitory effect on Plasmodium falciparum. The generated humAbAMA1 shows an affinity of 106-135 pM. It inhibits the parasite strain 3D7A growth in vitro with an expression system-independent IC50-value of 35 μg/ml (95% confidence interval: 33 μg/ml-37 μg/ml), which is three to eight times lower than the IC50-values of inhibitory antibodies 4G2 and 1F9. The epitope was mapped to the close proximity of the RON2-peptide binding groove.

Bias and concordance were measured and plotted.--NEW SECTION--Overall, mean ± SD Hb concentration was 116 ± 13 g/L using the Hb 201+ and 118 ± 12 g/L using the Hb 301; and anemia prevalence (Hb < 120 g/L) was 58% (n = 102) and 58% (n = 101), respectively. Overall bias ± SD was 2.0 ± 10.5 g/L and concordance (95% CI) was 0.63 (0.54, 0.72). Despite the 2 g/L bias detected between models, anemia prevalence was very similar in both models.--NEW SECTION--The two models measured anemia prevalence comparably in this population of women in rural Cambodia.",eng,International journal of laboratory hematology,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2017

SRL172, an inactivated, whole-cell mycobacterial vaccine, was safe, immunogenic and reduced the incidence of culture-confirmed tuberculosis in a phase III trial in HIV-infected and BCG immunized adults in Tanzania. Here we describe the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DAR-901, a booster vaccine against tuberculosis manufactured from the same seed strain using a new scalable method.--NEW SECTION--We evaluated IFN-γ responses by ELISpot and antibody responses by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice after three doses of DAR-901. In an aerosol challenge model, we evaluated the protective efficacy of the DAR-901 booster in C57BL/6 mice primed with BCG and boosted with two doses of DAR-901 at 4 dosage levels in comparison with homologous BCG boost.--NEW SECTION--DAR-901 vaccination elicited IFN-γ responses to mycobacterial antigen preparations derived from both DAR-901 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. DAR-901 immunization enhanced antibody responses to DAR-901 but not Mycobacterium tuberculosis lysate or purified protein derivative. Among animals primed with BCG, boosting with DAR-901 at 1 mg provided greater protection against aerosol challenge than a homologous BCG boost (lungs P = 0.036, spleen P = 0.028).--NEW SECTION--DAR-901 induces cellular and humoral immunity and boosts protection from M. tuberculosis compared to a homologous BCG boost.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Potential risk factors were evaluated in univariate analysis for associations with local control; multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to identify the combined effects. Complications were recorded. The pre- and postoperative visual analogue scale of pain, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores, and quality of life scores were collected to evaluate the impact of surgery.--NEW SECTION--The cumulative survival rates were 71.8%, 41.1%, and 22.5% and the local control rates were 95.4%, 90.9%, and 79.4% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Tumors with rapid growth, the lack of preoperative radiotherapy, and application of aortic balloon occlusion were significantly associated with good local control. There were 29 (18.8%) complications related to surgery. The mean pain scores were 7.04 preoperatively, 1.66 at 1 month postoperatively (p = 0.003), and 1.51 at 3 months postoperatively (p = 0.002). The mean ECOG scores were 2.82 preoperatively and 1.47 3 months postoperatively (p < 0.001). There were significant improvements from preoperatively to 3 months postoperatively in global health status (43.3 vs. 52.1), pain (62.0 vs. 33.2), and constipation (51.4 vs. 30.3) (p < 0.001).--NEW SECTION--Surgery for sacral metastasis is effective to palliate pain rapidly and improve constipation and quality of life and has a low rate of complications.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Unlike in the west, where older population is most affected, the burden of diabetes in Asian countries is disproportionately high in young to middle-age adults. The incidence of diabetic nephropathy is alarmingly high in patients with early onset T2DM, especially in those with poor glycemic control. How to control this chronic and debilitating disease is currently a very important health issue in Asia. Bariatric surgery has proven successful in treating not just obesity but also T2DM in morbid obese patients (body mass index [BMI] >35 kg/m²). Gastrointestinal metabolic surgery recently has been proposed as a new treatment modality for obesity related T2DM for patients with BMI <35 kg/m². Many studies from Asia reported promising results of metabolic surgery to treat obese patients with T2DM which is not well controlled. It has been demonstrated that changes in gastrointestinal hormone secretion after gastrointestinal surgery would favor an early improvement of T2DM in Asians. New procedures have also been designed and proposed specifically for the treatment of diabetes in Asia. This article examines clinical trial data and accepted algorithms with a view toward elucidating the application of metabolic surgery for the treatment of T2DM in the Asia. We propose a systematic approach to surgical treatment, addressing current evidences, patient selection, procedure of choice, and timing and guideline for new procedures.",eng,Diabetes & metabolism journal,Review,2025-04-23,2016

METHODS The CINAHL, EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE, and Scopus databases were systematically searched for studies of dynamic mathematical models set in LTCFs. Models of interventions targeting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in LTCFs were critically assessed. Using this analysis, we developed a checklist for good quality mathematical models of AMR in LTCFs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Overall, 18 papers described mathematical models that characterized the spread of infectious diseases in LTCFs, but no models of AMR in gram-negative bacteria in this setting were described. Future models of AMR in LTCFs require a more robust methodology (ie, formal model fitting to data and validation), greater transparency regarding model assumptions, setting-specific data, realistic and current setting-specific parameters, and inclusion of movement dynamics between LTCFs and hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Mathematical models of AMR in gram-negative bacteria in the LTCF setting, where these bacteria are increasingly becoming prevalent, are needed to help guide infection prevention and control. Improvements are required to develop outputs of sufficient quality to help guide interventions and policy in the future. We suggest a checklist of criteria to be used as a practical guide to determine whether a model is robust enough to test policy.

27989237,10.1186/s12916-016-0760-x,Modernising epidemic science: enabling patient-centred research during epidemics.,"Emerging and epidemic infectious disease outbreaks are a significant public health problem and global health security threat. As an outbreak begins, epidemiological investigations and traditional public health responses are generally mounted very quickly. However, patient-centred research is usually not prioritised when planning and enacting the response. Instead, the clinical research response occurs subsequent to and separate from the public health response, and is inadequate for evidence-based decision-making at the bedside or in the offices of public health policymakers.--NEW SECTION--The deficiencies of the clinical research response to severe acute respiratory syndrome, pandemic influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus demonstrate that current research models do not adequately inform and improve the quality of clinical care or public health response. Three suggestions for improvements are made. First, integrate the data and sample collection needs for clinical and public health decision-making within a unified framework, combined with a risk-based, rather than a discipline-based, approach to ethical review and consent. Second, develop clinical study methods and tools that are specifically designed to meet the epidemiological and contextual challenges of emerging and epidemic infectious diseases. Third, invest in investigator-led clinical research networks that are primed and incentivised to respond to outbreak infections, and which can call on the support and resources of a central centre of excellence.--NEW SECTION--It is crucial that the field of epidemic science matures to place patients at the heart of the response. This can only be achieved when patient-centred research is integrated in the outbreak response from day one and practical steps are taken to reduce the barriers to the generation of reliable and useful evidence.",eng,BMC medicine,Editorial,2025-04-23,2016

However, previous studies assessed HRQOL after surgery within clinical trial populations only. The study goal was to determine the association of pre-cancer diagnosis HRQOL with the likelihood of receiving surgery and with overall survival in a national, population-based cohort of older women with advanced ovarian cancer.--NEW SECTION--The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) database was queried to identify 374 women aged 65years and older with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer from 1998 to 2011. Responses to the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and Veterans-RAND-12 (VR-12), two single-item global health questions, and Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) were abstracted. Multivariable models were used to quantify associations of HRQOL and ADL assessments with surgery and overall survival, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics.--NEW SECTION--Of 374 women with a HRQOL assessment prior to diagnosis, 199 (53%) underwent surgery. Increases in physical and mental HRQOL domains were significantly associated with receipt of surgery. The relationship between HRQOL domains and overall survival were not statistically significant. For ADLs, only difficulty in toilet use was significantly associated with survival.--NEW SECTION--In this population-based sample of older women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, pre-diagnosis HRQOL was predictive of receiving surgery, but not of overall survival.",eng,Gynecologic oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Regression analysis was employed to assess the determinants of dedicated HSS funding across 111 countries. Documents for 27 dedicated HSS grants including budgets and performance indicators were collected, and activities were analyzed by health system functions.--NEW SECTION--HSS funding per capita is significantly associated with TB and HIV funding per capita, but not per capita income and health worker density. Of 27 dedicated HSS grants, 11 had line-item budgets publicly available, in which health workforce and medical products form the majority (89% or US$132 million of US$148 million) of funds. Yet these areas accounted for 41.7% (215) of total 516 performance indicators.--NEW SECTION--Health worker densities were not correlated with HSS funding, despite the emphasis on health workforce in budgets and performance indicators.

However, commercially produced ultrasound gel is often cost-prohibitive and unavailable. We investigated whether images obtained using an alternative cornstarch-based gel would be of comparable quality with those using commercial gel.--NEW SECTION--This was a blinded, randomised, cross-over study comparing commercially produced ultrasound gel with home-made cornstarch-based gel. Ultrasound-trained faculty obtained three video clips with each gel type from patients at one urban ED. The clips were evaluated by a radiologist and an ultrasound-trained emergency physician. Images were assessed in terms of overall adequacy (dichotomous) and quality, resolution and detail using a rating scale (0-10). All sonographers and physicians reviewing the images were blinded to the type of gel used.--NEW SECTION--Thirty-four patients were enrolled in the study, producing 204 separate images (102 with each gel). The cornstarch gel clips were deemed accurate in 70.6% (95% CI 63.9% to 76.5%) of the scans, as compared with 65.2% (95% CI 58.4% to 71.4%) of those using commercial gel. There was no difference between the two groups with respect to image detail, resolution or quality.--NEW SECTION--Images produced using the cornstarch-based alternative ultrasound gel were of similar quality to those using commercial gel.

This study's purpose was to create and evaluate the Surgical Management and Reconstruction Training (SMART) course to help orthopedic surgeons from LMICs manage soft-tissue defects and reduce the rate of amputations.--NEW SECTION--In this prospective observational study, orthopedic surgeons from LMICs were recruited to attend a 2-day SMART course taught by plastic surgery faculty in San Francisco. Before the course, participants were asked to assess the burden of soft-tissue injury and amputation encountered at their respective sites of practice. A survey was then given immediately and 1-year postcourse to evaluate the quality of instructional materials and the course's effect in reducing the burden of amputation, respectively.--NEW SECTION--Fifty-one practicing orthopedic surgeons from 25 countries attended the course. No participant reported previously attempting a flap reconstruction procedure to treat a soft-tissue defect. Before the course, participants cumulatively reported 580-970 amputations performed annually as a result of soft-tissue defects. Immediately after the course, participants rated the quality and effectiveness of training materials to be a mean of ≥4.4 on a Likert scale of 5 (Excellent) in all 14 instructional criteria. Of the 34 (66.7%) orthopedic surgeons who completed the 1-year postcourse survey, 34 (100%, P < 0.01) reported performing flaps learned at the course to treat soft-tissue defects. Flap procedures prevented 116 patients from undergoing amputation; 554 (93.3%) of the cumulative 594 flaps performed by participants 1 year after the course were reported to be successful. Ninety-seven percent of course participants taught flap reconstruction techniques to colleagues or residents, and a self-reported estimate of 28 other surgeons undertook flap reconstruction as a result of information dissemination by 1 year postcourse.--NEW SECTION--The SMART Course can give orthopedic surgeons in LMICs the skills and knowledge to successfully perform flaps, reducing the self-reported incidence of amputations.

Conditions treatable with surgery account for 11% of the global burden of disease, with a disproportionate burden affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Less than 6% of the world's operations are performed in LMICs, with relief organizations performing nearly 250,000 operations annually in LMICs in addition to each country's domestic surgical capacity. Currently, surgical needs are not adequately met by the existing patchwork of federal and nongovernmental organizations' surgical services and surgical mission trips. Improving coordination between mission trips may have synergistic benefits for maximizing the efficacy of the individual trips and improving the overall quality of care.--NEW SECTION--To establish whether cooperation between surgical mission trips can lead to operational efficiency and to identify obstacles to cooperation.--NEW SECTION--In order to establish the veracity of cooperation translating into efficiency and to identify obstacles that prevent cooperation, a 50-question survey was created (see Supplement 1). The survey was sent to surgical program directors of the 147 major surgical programs in the United States and Canada with a follow-up telephone survey of 18 randomly selected programs.--NEW SECTION--The survey response rate was 14%.

The survey was online and anonymous.--NEW SECTION--A total of 278 residents completed the survey. A high level of motivation to participate in a global health elective was associated with interests in preparation for future global work, desire for activism in maternal health and social determinants of health, and becoming better informed on global health policy. Eighty-two percent of respondents stated they would participate in a global health curriculum if it were offered, and 54.8% would use their vacation time. There were associations between personal safety, family, lack of resources, and lack of interest from faculty and motivational level as perceived barriers. Eighty-one percent strongly agreed that scheduling conflicts and time constraints pose barriers; more than 80% either agreed or strongly agreed that funding such endeavors and a lack of mentorship are major deterrents to pursuing global health.--NEW SECTION--Because resident motivation is clearly high and international need persists, we determined that most barriers to training abroad are related to the structure and budget of residency programs.",eng,Annals of global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Regular delivery of anthelmintic drugs is the mainstay for global soil-transmitted helminth control. Deworming campaigns are often targeted to school-aged children, who are at high risk of soil-transmitted-helminth-associated morbidity. However, findings from modelling studies suggest that deworming campaigns should be expanded community-wide for effective control of soil-transmitted helminth transmission. We aimed to do a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effect of mass (community-wide) and targeted (children only) anthelmintic delivery strategies on soil-transmitted helminth prevalence in school-aged children.--NEW SECTION--In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science for articles published on or before Nov 5, 2015, reporting soil-transmitted helminth prevalence before and after distribution of albendazole or mebendazole, either targeted to children or delivered to the whole community. We excluded studies in which drug delivery was restricted to infected individuals or to a subset of the community or school, or if follow-up time was less than 3 months or greater than 18 months after drug delivery. We extracted data on study year, country, drug administration strategy, drug dose, number of deworming rounds, treatment coverage, diagnostic method, follow-up interval, and soil-transmitted helminth prevalence before and after treatment. We used inverse variance weighted generalised linear models, with prevalence reduction as the outcome variable, to examine the effect of mass versus targeted drug administration, as well as baseline prevalence, number of drug doses, and follow-up time. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016026929.--NEW SECTION--Of 10 538 studies identified, 56 studies were eligible for the systematic review and 38 of these were included in meta-analysis. Results of the regression models showed that mass deworming led to a significantly greater reduction in prevalence in children than targeted deworming, for both hookworm (odds ratio 4·6, 95% CI 1·8-11·6; p=0·0020) and Ascaris lumbricoides (16·4, 2·1-125·8; p=0·0092), with no effect seen for Trichuris trichiura. There was significant heterogeneity across studies; for targeted studies I2 was 97% for A lumbricoides and hookworm, and 96% for T trichiura, and for mass studies, I2 was 89% for A lumbricoides, 49% for hookworm, and 66% for T trichiura.--NEW SECTION--The results of this meta-analysis suggest that expanding deworming programmes community-wide is likely to reduce the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths in the high-risk group of school-aged children, which could lead to improved morbidity outcomes. These findings are in support of recent calls for re-evaluation of global soil-transmitted helminth control guidelines.--NEW SECTION--None.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Over 1 million deaths per year, along with the emergence of multi- and extensively-drug resistant strains of Mtb, have triggered intensive research into the pathogenicity and biochemistry of this microorganism, guiding the development of anti-TB chemotherapeutic agents. The essential mycobacterial cell wall, sharing some common features with all bacteria, represents an apparent 'Achilles heel' that has been targeted by TB chemotherapy since the advent of TB treatment. This complex structure composed of three distinct layers, peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan and mycolic acids, is vital in supporting cell growth, virulence and providing a barrier to antibiotics. The fundamental nature of cell wall synthesis and assembly has rendered the mycobacterial cell wall as the most widely exploited target of anti-TB drugs.

Consequently, in the absence of a gold standard assay for the diagnosis of Chagas disease, additional antigens or strategies are needed. A proteomic analysis of the trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigens (TESA) associated with exosomal vesicles shed by T. cruzi identified ∼80 parasite proteins, with the majority being trans-sialidases. Mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitation products performed using Chagas immune sera showed a marked enrichment in a subset of TESA proteins. Of particular relevance for diagnostic applications were the retrotransposon hot spot (RHS) proteins, which are absent in Leishmania spp., parasites that often confound diagnosis of Chagas disease. Interestingly, serological screens using recombinant RHS showed a robust immunoreactivity with sera from patients with clinical stages of Chagas ranging from asymptomatic to advance cardiomyopathy and this immunoreactivity was comparable to that of crude TESA. More importantly, no cross-reactivity with RHS was detected with sera from patients with malaria, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, or African sleeping sickness, making this protein an attractive reagent for diagnosis of Chagas disease.",eng,Journal of clinical microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Ten peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 and August 2015 met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Despite expanded ART access, FSW in sub-Saharan Africa have sub-optimal HIV care and treatment engagement outcomes. Stigma, discrimination, poor nutrition, food insecurity, and substance use were commonly reported and associated with poor linkage to care, retention in care, and ART initiation. Included studies suggest that interventions with FSW should focus on multilevel barriers to engagement in HIV care and treatment and explore the involvement of social support from intimate male partners. Our results emphasise several critical points of intervention for FSW living with HIV, which are urgently needed to enhance linkage to HIV care, retention in care, and treatment initiation, particularly where the HIV prevalence among FSW is greatest.",eng,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Health-related smartphone apps could help users self-manage their disease.--NEW SECTION--Fifty-three CHB patients were assessed in this randomized controlled before-and-after experimental study. The patients were randomly and equally assigned to groups that did (n=26) or did not (n=27) use the smartphone app for 12weeks. The experimental and control groups were analyzed for differences in disease knowledge, self-efficacy, and self-care before and after use of the smartphone app.--NEW SECTION--After intervention, patients who used the app displayed significantly increased disease knowledge compared with the control group (p=.015). Self-efficacy and self-care also significantly increased in the experimental group (p=0.006 and 0.001, respectively).--NEW SECTION--The smartphone app can be useful for increasing self-care in CHB patients.--NEW SECTION--App: application, CHB: chronic hepatitis B, CVI: content validity.",eng,Applied nursing research : ANR,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27968705,10.1089/ten.TEC.2016.0355,Efficient Nonviral Transfection of Primary Intervertebral Disc Cells by Electroporation for Tissue Engineering Application.,"Low back pain (LBP) is an increasing global health problem associated with intervertebral disc (IVD) trauma and degeneration. Current treatment options include surgical interventions with partial unsatisfactory outcomes reported such as failure to relieve LBP, nonunions, nerve injuries, or adjacent segment disease. Cell-based therapy and tissue engineered IVD constructs supplemented with transfected disc cells that incorporate factors enhancing matrix synthesis represent an appealing approach to regenerate the IVD. Gene delivery approaches using transient nonviral gene therapy by electroporation are of a high clinical translational value since the incorporated DNA is lost after few cell generations, leaving the host's genome unmodified. Human primary cells isolated from clinically relevant samples were generally found very hard to transfect compared to cell lines. In this study, we present a range of parameters (voltage pulse, number, and duration) from the Neon® Transfection System for efficient transfection of human and bovine IVD cells. To demonstrate efficiency, these primary cells were exemplarily transfected with the commercially available plasmid pCMV6-AC-GFP tagged with copepod turbo green fluorescent protein. Flow cytometry was subsequently applied to quantify transfection efficiency. Our results showed that two pulses of 1400 V for 20 ms revealed good and reproducible results for both human and bovine IVD cells with efficiencies ≥47%. The presented parameters allow for successful human and bovine IVD cell transfection and provide an opportunity for subsequent regenerative medicine application.",eng,"Tissue engineering.

27960229,10.1002/14651858.CD009921.pub2,Automated telephone communication systems for preventive healthcare and management of long-term conditions.,"Automated telephone communication systems (ATCS) can deliver voice messages and collect health-related information from patients using either their telephone's touch-tone keypad or voice recognition software. ATCS can supplement or replace telephone contact between health professionals and patients. There are four different types of ATCS: unidirectional (one-way, non-interactive voice communication), interactive voice response (IVR) systems, ATCS with additional functions such as access to an expert to request advice (ATCS Plus) and multimodal ATCS, where the calls are delivered as part of a multicomponent intervention.--NEW SECTION--To assess the effects of ATCS for preventing disease and managing long-term conditions on behavioural change, clinical, process, cognitive, patient-centred and adverse outcomes.--NEW SECTION--We searched 10 electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Global Health; WHOLIS; LILACS; Web of Science; and ASSIA); three grey literature sources (Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Theses, Australasian Digital Theses); and two trial registries (www.controlled-trials.com; www.clinicaltrials.gov) for papers published between 1980 and June 2015.--NEW SECTION--Randomised, cluster- and quasi-randomised trials, interrupted time series and controlled before-and-after studies comparing ATCS interventions, with any control or another ATCS type were eligible for inclusion. Studies in all settings, for all consumers/carers, in any preventive healthcare or long term condition management role were eligible.--NEW SECTION--We used standard Cochrane methods to select and extract data and to appraise eligible studies.--NEW SECTION--We included 132 trials (N = 4,669,689). Studies spanned across several clinical areas, assessing many comparisons based on evaluation of different ATCS types and variable comparison groups. Forty-one studies evaluated ATCS for delivering preventive healthcare, 84 for managing long-term conditions, and seven studies for appointment reminders. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence primarily because of the risk of bias for many outcomes. We judged the risk of bias arising from allocation processes to be low for just over half the studies and unclear for the remainder. We considered most studies to be at unclear risk of performance or detection bias due to blinding, while only 16% of studies were at low risk. We generally judged the risk of bias due to missing data and selective outcome reporting to be unclear.For preventive healthcare, ATCS (ATCS Plus, IVR, unidirectional) probably increase immunisation uptake in children (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 1.32; 5 studies, N = 10,454; moderate certainty) and to a lesser extent in adolescents (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11; 2 studies, N = 5725; moderate certainty). The effects of ATCS in adults are unclear (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 9.02; 2 studies, N = 1743; very low certainty).For screening, multimodal ATCS increase uptake of screening for breast cancer (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.04; 2 studies, N = 462; high certainty) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.55; 3 studies, N = 1013; high certainty) versus usual care. It may also increase osteoporosis screening. ATCS Plus interventions probably slightly increase cervical cancer screening (moderate certainty), but effects on osteoporosis screening are uncertain. IVR systems probably increase CRC screening at 6 months (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.48; 2 studies, N = 16,915; moderate certainty) but not at 9 to 12 months, with probably little or no effect of IVR (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99, 1.11; 2 studies, 2599 participants; moderate certainty) or unidirectional ATCS on breast cancer screening.Appointment reminders delivered through IVR or unidirectional ATCS may improve attendance rates compared with no calls (low certainty). For long-term management, medication or laboratory test adherence provided the most general evidence across conditions (25 studies, data not combined). Multimodal ATCS versus usual care showed conflicting effects (positive and uncertain) on medication adherence. ATCS Plus probably slightly (versus control; moderate certainty) or probably (versus usual care; moderate certainty) improves medication adherence but may have little effect on adherence to tests (versus control). IVR probably slightly improves medication adherence versus control (moderate certainty). Compared with usual care, IVR probably improves test adherence and slightly increases medication adherence up to six months but has little or no effect at longer time points (moderate certainty). Unidirectional ATCS, compared with control, may have little effect or slightly improve medication adherence (low certainty). The evidence suggested little or no consistent effect of any ATCS type on clinical outcomes (blood pressure control, blood lipids, asthma control, therapeutic coverage) related to adherence, but only a small number of studies contributed clinical outcome data.The above results focus on areas with the most general findings across conditions. In condition-specific areas, the effects of ATCS varied, including by the type of ATCS intervention in use.Multimodal ATCS probably decrease both cancer pain and chronic pain as well as depression (moderate certainty), but other ATCS types were less effective. Depending on the type of intervention, ATCS may have small effects on outcomes for physical activity, weight management, alcohol consumption, and diabetes mellitus. ATCS have little or no effect on outcomes related to heart failure, hypertension, mental health or smoking cessation, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects for preventing alcohol/substance misuse or managing illicit drug addiction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, hypercholesterolaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, spinal cord dysfunction or psychological stress in carers.Only four trials (3%) reported adverse events, and it was unclear whether these were related to the interventions.--NEW SECTION--ATCS interventions can change patients' health behaviours, improve clinical outcomes and increase healthcare uptake with positive effects in several important areas including immunisation, screening, appointment attendance, and adherence to medications or tests. The decision to integrate ATCS interventions in routine healthcare delivery should reflect variations in the certainty of the evidence available and the size of effects across different conditions, together with the varied nature of ATCS interventions assessed. Future research should investigate both the content of ATCS interventions and the mode of delivery; users' experiences, particularly with regard to acceptability; and clarify which ATCS types are most effective and cost-effective.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

(Zingiberaceae family) or turmeric, commonly used for cooking in Asian cuisine, is known to possess a broad range of pharmacological properties at relatively nontoxic doses. Curcumin is found to be effective against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). As demonstrated by in vitro experiment, curcumin exerts even more potent effects when used in combination with various other antibacterial agents. Hence, curcumin which is a natural product derived from plant is believed to have profound medicinal benefits and could be potentially developed into a naturally derived antibiotic in the future. However, there are several noteworthy challenges in the development of curcumin as a medicine. S. aureus infections, particularly those caused by the multidrug-resistant strains, have emerged as a global health issue and urgent action is needed. This review focuses on the antibacterial activities of curcumin against both methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We also attempt to highlight the potential challenges in the effort of developing curcumin into a therapeutic antibacterial agent.",eng,Journal of tropical medicine,Review,2025-04-23,2016

We estimated the subsequent reduction in smoking-related deaths from all new highest level measures adopted between 2007 and 2014.--NEW SECTION--Policy effect sizes based on previously validated SimSmoke models were applied to the number of smokers in each nation to determine the reduction in the number of smokers from policy adoption. On the basis of research that half of all smokers die from smoking, we derived the smoking-attributable deaths (SADs) averted of those smokers alive today.--NEW SECTION--In total, 88 countries adopted at least one highest level MPOWER policy between 2007 and 2014, resulting in almost 22 million fewer projected SADs. The largest number of future SADs averted was due to increased cigarette taxes (7.0 million), followed by comprehensive smoke-free laws (5.4 million), large graphic health warnings (4.1 million), comprehensive marketing bans (3.8 million) and comprehensive cessation interventions (1.5 million).--NEW SECTION--These findings demonstrate the immense public health impact of tobacco control policies adopted globally since the WHO-FCTC and highlight the importance of more countries adopting highest level MPOWER measures to reduce the global burden of tobacco use. Substantial additional progress could be made, especially if heavily populated nations with high smoking prevalence were to reach highest level MPOWER measures.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2018

We conducted a systematic review of randomized trials (RCTs) on the benefits and harms of switching to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-based regimens in ART-experienced patients.--NEW SECTION--We included RCTs in HIV-infected adults comparing switching to a TDF-containing regimen with maintaining or switching to another regimen. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS, SCI, and the WHO Global Health Library. We assessed bias with the Cochrane tool and synthesized data using random-effects meta-analyses and Peto's approach. For further analyses, we added data from a previous systematic review in treatment-naïve patients.--NEW SECTION--17 RCTs with 2210 patients were included. All but one study had a high risk of bias. There was no significant association of switching to TDF-based regimens with mortality, fractures, CD4-cell count, body fat, virological failure, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol. TDF-based regimens decreased total cholesterol (mean difference -12.05 mg/dL; 95% CI -20.76 to -3.34), trigylcerides (-14.33 mg/dL; -23.73 to -4.93), and bone mineral density (BMD; hip: -2.46%; -3.9 to -1.03; lumbar spine -1.52%; -2.69 to -0.34). Effects on estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) were inconsistent and depended on the measurement. Adding 22 RCTs from 8297 treatment-naïve patients gave consistent results with then significant reductions of LDL (-7.57 mg/dL; -10.37 to -4.78), HDL (-2.38 mg/dL; -3.83 to -0.93), and eGFR (-3.49 ml/min; -5.56 to -1.43).--NEW SECTION--Switching to TDF-based regimens is associated with reductions of BMD and lipid levels and possibly lowered kidney function.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that epigenetic modifications of the genome resulting from gene-environment interactions have a key role in the increased prevalence of atopic disease. In this review, we describe the recent evidence suggesting how epigenetic changes mediate susceptibility to food allergies, and discuss how immunotherapy (IT) may reverse these effects. We discuss the areas of the epigenome as yet unexplored in terms of food allergy and IT such as histone modification and chromatin accessibility, and new techniques that may be utilized in future studies.--NEW SECTION--Recent findings provide strong evidence that DNA methylation of certain promoter regions such as Forkhead box protein 3 is associated with clinical reactivity, and further, can be changed during IT treatment. Reports on other epigenetic changes are limited but also show evidence of significant change based on both disease status and treatment. In comparison to epigenetic studies focusing on asthma and allergic rhinitis, food allergy remains understudied. However, within the next decade, it is likely that epigenetic modifications may be used as biomarkers to aid in diagnosis and treatment of food-allergic patients.

However, in the context of extreme weight loss, body image and appearance may worsen again because the ""excess"" or ""loose"" skin can lead to both functional and profound dissatisfaction with appearance. These concerns have led to an increasing uptake of post-bariatric surgery, ""body-contouring"" procedures but the implications for quality of life (QoL) have not been thoroughly considered.--NEW SECTION--The objective was to identify the best available evidence regarding the QoL outcomes for adults following bariatric and body contouring surgery.--NEW SECTION--The review considered studies involving people aged 18 years and beyond who underwent bariatric surgery and body contouring surgery.--NEW SECTION--The review considered studies that evaluated bariatric surgery as well as body contouring surgery.--NEW SECTION--The review considered both experimental and epidemiological study designs.--NEW SECTION--The primary outcomes were QoL as measured by validated tools at less than two years, two to five years and more than five years following body contouring surgery. The secondary outcomes were adverse events, unsatisfactory aesthetic appearance and weight gain.--NEW SECTION--Six databases were searched, including Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and CINAHL.

Therefore, the data results are presented as a narrative summary in relation to the outcomes of interest.--NEW SECTION--Nine quantitative studies (four comparable cohort studies, including two group design and two four-group designs and five descriptive or case-series studies) were included in the review. The included studies reported significant clinical improvements in appearance, wellbeing and QoL. These included primary outcomes pointing to body image satisfaction, improved self-esteem and confidence, improved physical function/pain and improved social function. The secondary outcomes were related to adverse events in the early postoperative period and reported wound healing problems, including seromas, partial necrosis, dehiscence, hematoma and anemia because of blood loss. Also, some data sets shed light on appearance-related distress and body dysphoria post surgery associated with visible scars and contour deformities.--NEW SECTION--Body contouring surgery has been shown to have positive benefits, especially in relation to improved wellbeing, function and QoL.

Once phylogenies of interacting lineages have been inferred, there are a number of questions we may wish to ask, such as what was the relationship between the partners in the past? Have they co-evolved for thousands or millions of years, or has one of the partners switched among different host species? To answer such questions, researchers may conduct cophylogenetic analysis, to explore the relationships between the phylogenies of interacting lineages and determine whether the match is significant or find explanations for observed differences. When combined with dating analyses, cophylogenetic analyses may support cospeciation of the partners or phylogenetic tracking. As they may reveal dynamics of host-pathogen coevolution, cophylogenetic studies may also help tackle global health issues (e.g. document the spread of disease causing pathogens). Cophylogenetic studies of parasitoids and their insect hosts may also help identify effective biocontrol agents. With the advent of next generation sequencing technologies and keeping in mind that systematic errors may occur, cophylogenetics will benefit from better-resolved trees, allowing more accurate reconciliation. However as trees become larger, current algorithms also become more computationally challenging. Nevertheless, both theoretical and methodological developments are leading to more accurate and powerful tests of cospeciation through cophylogenetic analysis.",eng,Current opinion in insect science,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The Global Task Force on Radiotherapy for Cancer Control quantified this gap and showed that over half of patients worldwide do not have access to treatment. Governments, policy makers and the global health community have ignored this crisis due to the complexity of radiotherapy technology and its seemingly high upfront costs. However, understanding the cost of treatment in the context of a dramatic clinical benefit could help to demonstrate the feasibility of radiotherapy in diverse income settings. When there are scarce resources, such analysis is essential in order to set priorities and provide high-value interventions to large populations. Here we explore the current status of economic evaluation tools in LMICs and some of the barriers to their use. We describe how the concepts of health technology assessment, value-based care and investment frameworks can be applied to the global crisis of radiotherapy availability to guide appropriate capacity building and resource utilisation.

Using an existing analytic framework, we compare the global responses to the HIV and NCD epidemics and distill lessons from the HIV response that might be utilized to enhance the global NCD response. These include: 1) further educating and empowering communities and patients to increase demand for NCD services and to hold national governments accountable for establishing and achieving NCD targets; and 2) evidence to support the feasibility and effectiveness of large-scale NCD screening and treatment programs in low-resource settings. We conclude with a case study from Swaziland, a country that is making progress in confronting both HIV and NCD.",eng,Global heart,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Since the adoption of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in 2003, global health has turned toward addressing all NCD. I pose 2 questions. 1) What lessons can we apply from the WHO FCTC development and implementation processes to broader aspects of NCD prevention and control? 2) In retrospect, what could we have done better? I also propose 3 lessons: 1) it takes a broad-based alliance to make progress; 2) visible and courageous leadership matters, and is aided by financial support; and 3) in developing the FCTC, WHO focused on a few messages: demonize industry, tax, and regulate tobacco. We now need to broaden public and private players required for progress, use insights on levering market forces for NCD control, and build approaches that demonstrate empathy for millions struggling with NCD risks.",eng,Global heart,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Recognizing that these had emerged as leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world, including in many low- and middle-income countries, advocates from government and civil society had called for increased attention and a UN response. Earlier, NCD including CVD were absent from the global health agenda in part because of their omission from the Millennium Development Goals. The UN meeting and the global advocacy response offered a game-changing opportunity to redress this omission. The World Heart Federation (WHF) played an instrumental role in the UN meeting and follow up, including inclusion of CVD in the Sustainable Development Goals. The next phase of the global CVD movement is expected through national action, including CVD roadmaps and partnering with the World Health Organization. The WHF is heavily committed to these goals and the other nongovernmental organizations invested in the mission must help take this historical mandate forward. Instrumental to this will be the engagement of people affected by or at risk of developing CVD, to draw more attention and resources to NCD and to ensure that successes to date in global policy translate into action at the national level.",eng,Global heart,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The resulting practice of routine evacuation for birth from smaller towns to larger urban centres points to a potential conflict between the necessity to ensure patient safety and the importance of delivering services that are responsive to the health needs and values of populations served.--NEW SECTION--To identify recommended performance/quality indicators for use in circumpolar maternity care systems.--NEW SECTION--We searched Scopus, Ebscohost databases (including Academic Search Complete and CINAHL), the Global Health Database, High North Research Documents, and online grey literature. Articles were included if they focused on maternal health indicators in the population of interest (Indigenous women, women receiving care in circumpolar or remote regions). Articles were excluded if they were not related to pregnancy, birth or the immediate post-partum or neonatal periods. Two reviewers independently reviewed articles for inclusion and extracted relevant data.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-six documents were included. Twelve were government documents, seven were review articles or indicator compilations, four were indicator sets recommended by academics or non-governmental organizations and three were research papers. We extracted and categorized 81 unique health indicators. The majority of indicators reflected health systems processes and outcomes during the antenatal and intra-partum periods. Only two governmental indicator sets explicitly considered the needs of Indigenous peoples.--NEW SECTION--This review demonstrates that, although most circumpolar health systems engage in performance reporting for maternity care, efforts to capture local priorities and values are limited in most regions. Future work in this area should involve northern stakeholders in the process of indicator selection and development.",eng,International journal of circumpolar health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This study explores such strategies implemented in Epworth, Zimbabwe, during 2009-2014, and the implications these strategies might have on other peri-urban areas.--NEW SECTION--Qualitative and quantitative methods were used in an exploratory and cross-sectional design. Purposive sampling was used to select key informants, a sample of healthcare workers that participated in in-depth interviews and community members who took part in focus group discussions. Secondary data were collected through a documentary search. Qualitative data were analysed through thematic analysis. Quantitative secondary data were examined using descriptive statistics and then compared with qualitative data to reinforce analysis.--NEW SECTION--The HRH reform policy strategies that were identified included ministerial intervention; policy review; and revival of the human resource for health planning, financial planning, multi-sector collaboration, and community engagement. These had some positive effects; however, desired outcomes were undermined by financial, material, human resource, and social constraints.--NEW SECTION--Despite constraints, the strategies helped revive the health delivery system in Epworth.

Seventy-nine cases and 158 controls in the age group of 40-74 years were selected for the study in order to have case to control ratio 1:2. The criterion for selecting cases and control was based on Ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI). Cases were selected from those who had ABPI 0.85 or less (ABPI ≤0.85) in either lower limb. Controls were selected from those ABPI score between 1.18 and 1.28 in both lower limbs. Only newly identified individuals with PAD were selected as cases.

Unfortunately, progress towards maternal, newborn and infant health MDGs has lagged significantly behind other key health goals, demanding a renewed global effort in this key health area. The World Health Organization and other institutions heralded integrated antenatal care (ANC) as the best way to address the inter-related health issues of HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria in the high risk groups of pregnant women and infants; integrated ANC services also offer a mechanism to address slow progress towards improved maternal health.--NEW SECTION--There is remarkably limited evidence on best practice approaches of program implementation, acceptability and effectiveness for integrated ANC models targeting multiple diseases. Here, we discuss current integrated ANC global guidelines and the limited literature describing integrated ANC implementation and evidence for their role in addressing HIV, malaria and TB during pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa. We highlight the paucity of data on the effectiveness of integrated ANC models and identify significant structural barriers in the health system (funding, infrastructure, distribution, human resources), the adoption system (limited buy-in from implementers, leadership, governance) and, in the broader context, patient-centred barriers (fear, stigma, personal burdens) and barriers in funding structures. We highlight recommendations for action and discuss avenues for the global health community to develop systems to integrate multiple disease programs into ANC models of care that better address these three priority infectious diseases. With the current transition to the SDGs and concerns regarding the failure to meet maternal health MDGs, the global health community, researchers, implementers and funding bodies must work together to ensure the establishment of quality operational and implementation research to inform integrated ANC models. It is imperative that the global health community engages in a timely discussion about such implementation innovations and instigates appropriate actions to ensure advances in maternal health are sufficient to meet applicable SDGs.",eng,BMC medicine,Editorial,2025-04-23,2016

This is achieved by rolling circle amplification mediated conversion of enzymatic reactions happening within nanometer dimensions to directly detectable micrometer sized DNA products. The system utilizes the unique integration reaction of IN to generate a surface anchored nicked DNA circle that serves as a substrate for rolling circle amplification and allows for specific, quantitative and sensitive detection of purified recombinant IN or virus particles with a detection limit of less than 30 virus particles per μL of sample. Moreover, by modifying the nucleotide sequences of the utilized DNA it was possible to tailor the system to distinguish between the highly pathogenic lentivirus HIV and the gammaretrovirus murine leukemia virus present in a given sample. Infections with HIV remain a major threat to global health with more than 2 million new infections and 1 million deaths each year. The sensitive and specific detection of HIV particles based on IN activity holds promise for the development of a new type of diagnostic tools suitable for early (within hours of infection) detection of HIV, which would be valuable for prevention strategies as well as for efficient treatment.",eng,Nanoscale,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

The primary objective was to describe the long-term outcome of newborns with gastroschisis treated in three tertiary care hospitals of France in terms of neurodevelopment and QoL. Materials and Methods The study reported was a cross-sectional, descriptive multicentric retrospective study assessing the outcome of newborns with gastroschisis, born between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2014, treated at two large and French level III neonatal intensive care units. Long-term outcome data were assessed by questionnaires sent to the infants' parents. Questionnaires explored global health, neurological development, and quality of life (overall assessment including socio-economic and medical), Age & Stages Questionnaire, infants' quality of life (KIDSCREEN), and quality of parents' life (General Questionnaire Short Form-36). Results In this study, 50% of the survivor's families answered the assessment form (n = 33). The average follow-up age was 40 months, ranging from 8 months to 6 years. Cases of simple gastroschisis more often had a normal score for ""communication"" (p = 0.033), while patients who received morphine for a longer duration had significantly lower scores for the items ""communication"" and ""problem resolving"" (p = 0.024 and p = 0.011, respectively). Children's QoL was significantly lower for patients with gestational age younger than 36 weeks (p = 0.023) and for patients born following ""fetal cause delivery"" (p = 0.022). Parents had a significantly higher physical composite score if their child underwent primary closure (p = 0.012). Conclusion Our analyses confirm the idea that cases of complex gastroschisis and preterm delivery may lead to poorer outcome. Such hindsight (40 months in mean) allowed for an interesting assessment of development long after the patient's initial hospitalization and to confirm these results, a standardized neuropsychological evaluation of patients should be done when at least 6 years old. An accurate assessment of the social environment and its impact on the development and QoL of children will be fundamental to avoid selection bias.",eng,European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

The development of safe and cost-effective vaccine candidates for HPAI is considered the best strategy for managing the disease and addressing the pandemic preparedness. The most potential vaccine candidate is the antigenic determinant of influenza A virus, hemagglutinin (HA). The present research was aimed at developing optimized expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and protein purification process for HA from the Malaysian isolate of H5N1 as a vaccine antigen for HPAI H5N1. Expression of HA from the Malaysian isolate of HPAI in N. benthamiana was confirmed, and more soluble protein was expressed as truncated HA, the HA1 domain over the entire ectodomain of HA. Two different purification processes were evaluated for efficiency in terms of purity and yield. Due to the reduced yield, protein degradation and length of the 3-column purification process, the 2-column method was chosen for target purification. Purified HA1 was found immunogenic in mice inducing H5 HA-specific IgG and a hemagglutination inhibition antibody.

In the current study, expression level of Cygb was determined in proliferating and differentiating 3T3-F442A cells by gene expression and protein expression analysis. Results revealed that Cygb expression up-regulated in differentiated cells in parallel with adipogenic differentiation markers; PPARγ, CEBPα and FABP4 expressions. Besides, Cygb overexpression in preadipocytes contributed to the adipogenic differentiation as verified by detection of higher lipid droplets and increased PPARγ, CEBPα and FABP4 expressions with respect to control cells. These findings will shed light on the unknown roles of Cygb in adipogenesis and obesity.",eng,Cytotechnology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently developed a global elimination strategy for HBV infection. Increasing access to screening, liver assessment, and antiviral treatment are crucial steps in achieving this goal. Little is known, however, about obstacles to linkage to care in low- and middle-income countries. Using a grounded theory approach, this qualitative study sought to characterize the diagnostic itineraries of people with chronic HBV infection in Burkina Faso, a west African country with high HBV prevalence, to identify barriers to linkage from screening to specialist care with hepatic assessment (alanine transaminase and hepatitis B e antigen or HBV DNA). We conducted 80 semistructured interviews with chronically infected people, their families, medical personnel, and traditional practitioners, and participant observation of HBV diagnostic announcements and consultations. Of 30 individuals diagnosed with chronic viral hepatitis, 18 inadvertently discovered their status through blood screening and 12 actively sought diagnosis for their symptoms. Only a quarter (8/30) were linked to care. Barriers included: 1) patients' ability to pay for testing and treatment; 2) a formal health system lacking trained personnel, diagnostic infrastructures, and other resources; 3) patients' familial and social networks that discouraged access to testing and HBV knowledge; 4) a well-developed demand for and provisioning of traditional medicine for hepatitis; and 5) a weak global politics around HBV. More training for medical personnel would improve linkage to care in sub-Saharan Africa. Developing effective communications between medical workers and patients should be a major priority in this elimination strategy.",eng,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This review provides a summary of clinical trials and human studies on the pharmacotherapy of methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). Areas covered: We summarize published clinical trials that tested candidate medications for MUD and also conducted PubMed and Google Scholar searches to identify recently completed clinical trials using the keywords 'methamphetamine' 'addiction' 'pharmacotherapy' and 'clinical trial.' To determine the status of ongoing clinical trials targeting MUD, we also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov online database. We conclude this review with a discussion of current research gaps and future directions. Expert commentary: Clinical trials examining the potential for pharmacotherapies of MUD have largely been negative. Future studies need to address several limitations to reduce the possibility of Type II errors: small sample sizes, high dropout rates or multiple comorbidities. Additionally, new treatment targets, such as MA-induced disruptions in cognition and in the neuroimmune system, merit trials with agents that selectively modulate these processes.",eng,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

When manifesting in the lungs, severe malaria causes acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). We have previously shown that a proportion of DBA/2 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) develop ALI/ARDS and that these mice recapitulate various aspects of the human syndrome, such as pulmonary edema, hemorrhaging, pleural effusion and hypoxemia. Herein, we investigated the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of malaria-associated ALI/ARDS. Mice developing ALI/ARDS showed greater neutrophil accumulation in the lungs compared with mice that did not develop pulmonary complications. In addition, mice with ALI/ARDS produced more neutrophil-attracting chemokines, myeloperoxidase and reactive oxygen species. We also observed that the parasites Plasmodium falciparum and PbA induced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) ex vivo, which were associated with inflammation and tissue injury. The depletion of neutrophils, treatment with AMD3100 (a CXCR4 antagonist), Pulmozyme (human recombinant DNase) or Sivelestat (inhibitor of neutrophil elastase) decreased the development of malaria-associated ALI/ARDS and significantly increased mouse survival. This study implicates neutrophils and NETs in the genesis of experimentally induced malaria-associated ALI/ARDS and proposes a new therapeutic approach to improve the prognosis of severe malaria.",eng,PLoS pathogens,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This paper describes the development and preliminary assessment of the clinical accuracy of a heterogeneous immunoassay that integrates a serum pretreatment process with readout by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for the low-level detection of mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM). ManLAM is a major virulence factor in the infectious pathology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that has been found in the serum and other body fluids of infected patients. The effectiveness of ManLAM as a TB diagnostic marker, however, remains unproven for reasons not yet well understood. As reported herein, we have found that (1) ManLAM complexes with proteins and possibly other components in serum; (2) these complexes have a strongly detrimental impact on the ability to detect ManLAM using an immunoassay; (3) a simple pretreatment step can disrupt this complexation; and (4) disruption by pretreatment improves detection by 250×. We also describe the results from a preliminary assessment on the utility of serum pretreatment by running immunoassays on archived specimens from 24 TB-positive patients and 10 healthy controls. ManLAM was measurable in 21 of the 24 TB-positive specimens, but not in any of the 10 control specimens. These findings, albeit for a very small specimen set, translate to a clinical sensitivity of 87.5% and a clinical specificity of 100%. Together, these results both provide much needed evidence for the clinical utility of ManLAM as a TB marker, and demonstrate the potential utility of our overall approach to serve as a new strategy for the development of diagnostic tests for this disease.",eng,The Analyst,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

HCV is associated with several hepatic and extrahepatic disorders, including several malignancies. The burden of HCV-related disorders is influenced by the number of new and existing cases, number of existing cases and the natural history of the infection. The natural history of HCV is affected by several demographic, virological, clinical and lifestyle factors. Major variations exist in the burden of HCV among different populations and geographical regions, as well as over time. With the advent of new and efficacious antiviral treatments, it is important to learn the determinants of HCV burden to design appropriate strategies for detection, prognostication and treatment. Furthermore, with the expected growth of patients cured of HCV, it is essential to learn about the possible change in natural history and burden of disease in these patients.

Standard assessment includes history, examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and serial troponin testing. Computerised tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) enables additional anatomical assessment of patients for coronary artery disease (CAD) but has only been studied in very low-risk patients. This trial aims to investigate the effect of early CTCA upon interventions, event rates and health care costs in patients with suspected/confirmed ACS who are at intermediate risk.--NEW SECTION--Participants will be recruited in about 35 tertiary and district general hospitals in the UK. Patients ≥18 years old with symptoms with suspected/confirmed ACS with at least one of the following will be included: (1) ECG abnormalities, e.g. ST-segment depression >0.5 mm; (2) history of ischaemic heart disease; (3) troponin elevation above the 99th centile of the normal reference range or increase in high-sensitivity troponin meeting European Society of Cardiology criteria for 'rule-in' of myocardial infarction (MI). The early use of ≥64-slice CTCA as part of routine assessment will be compared to standard care. The primary endpoint will be 1-year all-cause death or recurrent type 1 or type 4b MI at 1 year, measured as the time to such event. A number of secondary clinical, process and safety endpoints will be collected and analysed. Cost effectiveness will be estimated in terms of the lifetime incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. We plan to recruit 2424 (2500 with ~3% drop-out) evaluable patients (1212 per arm) to have 90% power to detect a 20% versus 15% difference in 1-year death or recurrent type 1 MI or type 4b MI, two-sided p < 0.05.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of HBsAg on the cell surface of human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T). After transformation of expression vector pcDNA/HBsAg to E.coli TOP10F', plasmid was extracted and digested with BglII. Afterwards, the linearized vector was transfected to cells and treated with hygromycin B for 5 weeks to expand the resulted clonies. The permanent expression of HBsAg followed by flow cytometry uptill now about one year. Genomic DNA was extracted from transfected cells and the existence of HBsAg gene was assessed by PCR. Real-time RT-PCR was utilized to measure the expression at the RNA level and flow cytometery was carried out to assess protein expression. Insertion of HBsAg cDNA in HEK293T genome was confirmed by PCR. The results of real-time RT-PCR illustrated that each cell expresses 2275 copies of mRNA molecule. Flow cytometry showed that compared with negative control cells, 99.9% of transfected cells express HBsAg on their surface. In conclusion, stable expression of hepatitis B surface antigen on the membrane of HEK293T provides an accurate post-translational modification, proper structure, and native folding in contrast with purified protein from prokaryotic expression systems.

Importantly, NAFLD is one of its most dangerous complications because it can lead to severe liver pathologies, including fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatic cellular carcinoma. Given the increasing worldwide prevalence of obesity, NAFLD has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease and therefore is a major global health problem. Currently, NAFLD is predominantly regarded as a hepatic manifestation of MetS. However, accumulating evidence indicates that the effects of NAFLD extend beyond the liver and are negatively associated with a range of chronic diseases, most notably cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is becoming increasingly clear that these diseases are the result of the same underlying pathophysiological processes associated with MetS, such as insulin resistance, chronic systemic inflammation and dyslipidemia. As a result, they have been shown to be independent reciprocal risk factors. In addition, recent data have shown that NAFLD actively contributes to aggravation of the pathophysiology of CVD, T2DM, and CKD, as well as several other pathologies. Thus, NAFLD is a direct cause of many chronic diseases associated with MetS, and better detection and treatment of fatty liver disease is therefore urgently needed. As non-invasive screening methods for liver disease become increasingly available, detection and treatment of NAFLD in patients with MetS should therefore be considered by both (sub-) specialists and primary care physicians.",eng,World journal of gastroenterology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Concomitant phenotypes of altered neprilysin expression included impaired food intake, reduced body size, and characteristic changes in the metabolite composition. Ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive mutant did not elicit any of the phenotypes, which confirms abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative factor.

In this report, an expert panel review and discuss the current approaches to disaster education and training and propose a three-step operational learning framework that could be used for EMTs globally. The proposed framework includes the following steps: 1) ensure professional competence and license to practice, 2) support adaptation of technical and non-technical professional capacities into the low-resource and emergency context and 3) prepare for an effective team performance in the field. A combination of training methodologies is also recommended, including individual theory based education, immersive simulations and team training. Agreed curriculum and open access training materials for EMTs need to be further developed, ideally through collaborative efforts between WHO, operational EMT organizations, universities, professional bodies and training agencies.  Keywords: disasters; education; emergencies; global health; learning.",eng,PLoS currents,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are generated by the nuclear reprogramming of any somatic cell using a variety of established but evolving methods. This approach offers medical science unparalleled experimental opportunity to model an individual patient's disease ""in a dish."" HiPSCs permit developmentally rationalized directed differentiation into any cell type, which express donor cell mutation(s) at pathophysiological levels and thus hold considerable potential for disease modeling, drug discovery, and potentially cell-based therapies. This review will focus on the translational potential of hiPSCs in clinical neurology and the importance of integrating this approach with complementary model systems to increase the translational yield of preclinical testing for the benefit of patients. This strategy is particularly important given the expected increase in prevalence of neurodegenerative disease, which poses a major burden to global health over the coming decades.",eng,Cell biology and toxicology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

27913648,10.4049/jimmunol.1600856,CD36-Mediated Uptake of Surfactant Lipids by Human Macrophages Promotes Intracellular Growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis imposes a large global health burden as the airborne agent of tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been flourishing in human populations for millennia and is therefore highly adapted to the lung environment. Alveolar macrophages, a major host cell niche for M. tuberculosis, are not only phagocytose inhaled microbes and particulate matter but are also crucial in catabolizing lung surfactant, a lipid-protein complex that lines the alveolar spaces. Because macrophage host defense properties can be regulated by surfactant and M. tuberculosis can use host lipids as a carbon source during infection, we sought to determine the receptor(s) involved in surfactant lipid uptake by human macrophages and whether the presence of those lipids within macrophages prior to infection with M. tuberculosis enhances bacterial growth. We show that preformed scavenger receptor CD36 is redistributed to the cell membrane following exposure to surfactant lipids and surfactant protein A. Subsequently, surfactant lipids and/or surfactant protein A enhance CD36 transcript and protein levels. We show that CD36 participates in surfactant lipid uptake by human macrophages, as CD36 knockdown reduces uptake of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, the most prevalent surfactant lipid species. Finally, exposing human macrophages to surfactant lipids prior to infection augments M. tuberculosis growth in a CD36-dependent manner. Thus, we provide evidence that CD36 mediates surfactant lipid uptake by human macrophages and that M. tuberculosis exploits this function for growth.",eng,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Despite the increased amount of attention paid to health systems strengthening, there is no standard definition of this concept among global health actors. Germany is no exception. Though there have been recent commitments to increase resources allocated to health systems strengthening, German Development Cooperation has no comprehensive strategy for its pursuit. This article sheds light on how HSS can be more clearly defined in German bilateral health cooperation, and makes a case for the adoption of a comprehensive HSS strategy.A strategic analysis of the German Development Cooperation's orientation towards health systems strengthening reveals the focal areas and cross-cutting approaches of Germany's engagement with the health systems strengthening. These elements are then linked to the building blocks of the health system, as defined by the World Health Organization. The resulting framework should be further elaborated with data from implementation to develop a comprehensive health systems strengthening strategy. Both the U.S. and U.K. have also recently reviewed their own health systems strengthening efforts and concluded with clear statements on the need for well-defined health systems strengthening strategies. We argue that in developing such strategies, a sound base can be provided by a health systems strengthening framework that is based on both strategic inputs from existing health policies as well as implementation experiences.Despite its limitations, the current framework provided in this review shows how the German Development Cooperation intends to enact health systems strengthening, and can thus have several uses: (1) ensure the systemic nature of health systems strengthening planning and implementation (2) guide the consistency of Germany's approach to health systems strengthening within partner countries and (3) create theories of change for health evaluations. This approach can potentially be applied to systematically interpret health systems strengthening strategies of other global health actors, leading to better coherence and accountability in health development efforts.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Congenital ZIKV infection produces a range of mild to severe pathologies, including microcephaly. To understand the pathophysiology of ZIKV infection, we used models of the developing brain that faithfully recapitulate the tissue architecture in early to midgestation. We identify the brain cell populations that are most susceptible to ZIKV infection in primary human tissue, provide evidence for a mechanism of viral entry, and show that a commonly used antibiotic protects cultured brain cells by reducing viral proliferation. In the brain, ZIKV preferentially infected neural stem cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and microglia, whereas neurons were less susceptible to infection. These findings suggest mechanisms for microcephaly and other pathologic features of infants with congenital ZIKV infection that are not explained by neural stem cell infection alone, such as calcifications in the cortical plate. Furthermore, we find that blocking the glia-enriched putative viral entry receptor AXL reduced ZIKV infection of astrocytes in vitro, and genetic knockdown of AXL in a glial cell line nearly abolished infection. Finally, we evaluate 2,177 compounds, focusing on drugs safe in pregnancy. We show that the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin reduced viral proliferation and virus-induced cytopathic effects in glial cell lines and human astrocytes. Our characterization of infection in the developing human brain clarifies the pathogenesis of congenital ZIKV infection and provides the basis for investigating possible therapeutic strategies to safely alleviate or prevent the most severe consequences of the epidemic.",eng,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In low-resource settings with exceedingly high stillbirth rates, such as rural Chhattisgarh, India, it is vital to utilize low-cost, effective interventions. Mindfulness-based stress reduction is an evidence-based intervention utilized for a broad range of physical and mental health problems, and is adaptable to specific populations. The objective of this study was to explore the sustained effectiveness of a shortened, culturally adapted mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) designed to address complex grief after stillbirth. We used an observational, mixed-methods pre-post study design with 6-week and 12-month follow-up assessments among women with a history of stillbirth (N = 22). Analyses explored study outcomes and continued use of mindfulness skills. Pretest results showed elevated psychological symptoms and high levels of perinatal grief. General linear modeling repeated measures was used to explore 6-week and 12-month follow-up changes from baseline, controlling for significantly correlated demographic variables. Longitudinal results indicated significant reductions in perinatal grief and psychological symptoms; four of the five facets of mindfulness changed in the desired direction; and resilience scores indicated thriving. The shortened, culturally adapted, MBI pilot brought about sustained, significant reductions of perinatal grief and mental health symptoms, and participants reported use of mindfulness skills in day-to-day life. This study shows that the significant mental health needs among rural women of various castes and ethnicities in Chhattisgarh following stillbirth were successfully addressed by a promising MBI with potential scalability and sustainability.",eng,Issues in mental health nursing,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Despite well-intentioned efforts by public institutions, traditional health promotion techniques often lead to offending those most in need of weight loss. For example, when Bryn Mawr College targeted overweight students to offer a free fitness and nutrition program, it was met with accusations of fat-shaming, indicating that weight-centric messages operate in a more complex sociocultural system than many public health concerns. To better understand reactions to weight-centric health messages, college-aged women evaluated the Bryn Mawr College e-mail. Using an embedded mixed-methods design, analysis revealed that reactions followed four positive themes, six negative themes, and one neutral theme. Statistical tests indicated that health literacy, feminist identification, body dissatisfaction, and body size discrepancy influenced evaluations of message offensiveness and effectiveness. Contrary to the recommendations of traditional behavior change research, these results indicate that audience segmentation and message tailoring may not be effective for promoting weight loss.",eng,Health communication,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2018
27910749,10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2016017455,Role of Toll-Like Receptors in Hepatitis C Virus Pathogenesis and Treatment.,"Viral infections are rising every day, and viruses appear to be the most dangerous pathogens in the world. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is accepted as one of the major destructive factors of promoting severe hepatic disorders by infecting more than 180 million individuals throughout the world. Chronic infection caused by HCV poses a serious global health emergency and appears to be a powerful threat to humanity. Almost 20 years have passed since the disclosure of HCV, but even now, treatment preferences remain limited. Humans are born with a rapid and nonspecific mechanism to prevent viral attacks through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are evolutionary conserved cellular activator proteins responsible for recognizing specific components present on penetrating microbes and viruses. Recent research efforts in TLR biology suggest that targeting the TLRs and their signaling pathways during HCV infection could contribute to novel therapies against HCV. The mobilization of TLRs boosts antiviral communication and integrates the development of long-lasting acquired immune responses to limit viral pathogenesis. Both activation and suppression of TLRs are necessary for the efficient treatment of HCV. For the proper management and eradication of HCV, novel drugs that target TLRs and their signaling pathway are needed. This review summarizes the role of TLR signaling in HCV infection and treatment.",eng,Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Method: We conducted a critical interpretive review of the academic literature related to CBR in low- and middle-income countries and to indigenous communities in high-income countries. Using an inductive analysis of the collected articles, we identified five key topic areas related to ethical considerations. We then critically appraised this literature and developed eight questions that reflect areas of ethical tension, uncertainty, or debate. Results: The five key topic areas are partnerships among stakeholders, respect for culture and local experience, empowerment, accountability, and fairness in programme design. The eight ethical questions are linked to these topics and associated with how CBR practices reflect commitments to equity, respect, inclusion, participation, and social justice. Conclusion: Continued engagement with ethical considerations associated with CBR can help to strengthen the foundations of this important and influential approach. It is crucial that all those involved in CBR projects, including physiotherapists, pay careful attention to the development of partnerships that, despite asymmetries among stakeholders, are respectful and effective.",eng,Physiotherapy Canada.

27909222,10.3324/haematol.2016.154245,Associations between environmental factors and hospital admissions for sickle cell disease.,"Sickle cell disease is an increasing global health burden. This inherited disease is characterized by a remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, which can only partly be explained by genetic factors. Environmental factors are likely to play an important role but studies of their impact on disease severity are limited and their results are often inconsistent. This study investigated associations between a range of environmental factors and hospital admissions of young patients with sickle cell disease in London and in Paris between 2008 and 2012. Specific analyses were conducted for subgroups of patients with different genotypes and for the main reasons for admissions. Generalized additive models and distributed lag non-linear models were used to assess the magnitude of the associations and to calculate relative risks. Some environmental factors significantly influence the numbers of hospital admissions of children with sickle cell disease, although the associations identified are complicated. Our study suggests that meteorological factors are more likely to be associated with hospital admissions for sickle cell disease than air pollutants. It confirms previous reports of risks associated with wind speed (risk ratio: 1.06/standard deviation; 95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.12) and also with rainfall (1.06/standard deviation; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.12). Maximum atmospheric pressure was found to be a protective factor (0.93/standard deviation; 95% confidence interval: 0.88-0.99). Weak or no associations were found with temperature. Divergent associations were identified for different genotypes or reasons for admissions, which could partly explain the lack of consistency in earlier studies. Advice to patients with sickle cell disease usually includes avoiding a range of environmental conditions that are believed to trigger acute complications, including extreme temperatures and high altitudes. Scientific evidence to support such advice is limited and sometimes confusing. This study shows that environmental factors do explain some of the variations in rates of admission to hospital with acute symptoms in sickle cell disease, but the associations are complex, and likely to be specific to different environments and the individual's exposure to them. Furthermore, this study highlights the need for prospective studies with large numbers of patients and standardized protocols across Europe.",eng,Haematologica,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

The lack of effective therapies for obesity and its associated metabolic syndrome is an urgent societal issue. To elucidate whether mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapies can ameliorate high-fat diet-induced obesity and compare the effectiveness of several methodological approaches, we transplanted human MSCs, MSC-derived brown adipocytes (M-BA), and MSC lysateinto obese mice. All 3 MSC-based treatments improved obesity-associated metabolic syndromes including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, glucose intolerance, and inflammation in obese mice after repeated administration for 10 weeks. MSC-based treatments altered the ratio of adiponectin to leptin and regulated the expression of Pparα and Pparγ, which are involved in maintaining energy homeostasis, in major metabolic tissues. Among treatments, M-BA showed the strongest beneficial effect. Importantly, M-BA administration not only reduced obesity-associated metabolic syndromes but also reduced body weight and hyperlipidemia, indicating that it is an effective therapy for obesity.

We included both observational and intervention studies reporting effect measures and their confidence intervals of polyunsaturated fatty acids intake in the regular diet or supplementation and pain. Two investigators selected studies; extracted data independently on baseline characteristics, exposure, and outcomes; and rated the quality of interventional studies using Jadad score. We calculated pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) of pain indexes such as the Visual Analogue Score. We further carried out subgroup analyses by disease, type of PUFA, outcome scale, quality index, dose, and time of supplementation.--NEW SECTION--We retrieved 5 observational and 46 intervention studies. Only one observational study showed a protective effect of PUFA. On the contrary, the interventional studies yielded a pooled random effects SMD of -0.40 (95% CI -0.58, -0.22), which indicates improvement, as 0 is the value that indicates absence of effect. The largest effect was found for dysmenorrhea (SMD -0.82, 95% CI -1.21, -0.43), Ω-3 supplementation (-0.47, 95% CI -0.68, -0.26) and composite scores (-0.58, 95% CI -1.07, -0.09).

It can serve as a starting point for future initiatives and collaborations.--NEW SECTION--A literature search for 'One Health' was performed using National Center for Biotechnology Information and Google. Moreover, information from global and European policy documents was collected and a questionnaire was designed to gather current One Health research and training activities in Western Europe.--NEW SECTION--This overview shows that there is considerable recognition for One Health in Europe, although most educational initiatives are recent. In Europe, the One Health approach is currently mainly advocated in relation to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Many countries have incorporated the One Health approach in their policy to fight AMR, and funding possibilities for AMR research increased significantly. The number of national and international multidisciplinary research networks in the area of zoonotic diseases and One Health is increasing.--NEW SECTION--Although One Health has gained recognition in Europe, often a One Health approach to research and education in the area of zoonotic diseases and AMR is not implemented. In many countries, collaboration between sectors is still lacking, and One Health activities are predominantly initiated by the veterinary sector. To facilitate the multidisciplinary approach that is needed to fight zoonotic diseases and AMR, exploring current barriers for collaboration is needed.

Randomised controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, case-control studies, nested case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, and longitudinal studies were eligible for inclusion.--NEW SECTION--Three-hundred and thirty-one articles were identified, 141 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, resulting in 35 included studies. Multiple methodological and reporting weaknesses were apparent in the reviewed studies with 28 of the 35 studies scoring a negative rating in the risk of bias assessment. Meal skipping (any meal), defined as the skipping of any meal throughout the day, was reported in 12 studies with prevalence ranging between 5 and 83%. The remaining 25 studies identified specific meals and their skipping rates, with breakfast the most frequently skipped meal 14-88% compared to lunch 8-57% and dinner 4-57%. Lack of time was consistently reported as an important correlate of meal skipping, compared with correlates such as cost and weight control, while sex was the most commonly reported associated correlate. Breakfast skipping was more common among men while lunch or dinner skipping being more common among women.--NEW SECTION--This review is the first to examine potential correlates of meal skipping in young adults. Future research would benefit from stronger design and reporting strategies, using a standardised approach for measuring and defining meal skipping.",eng,The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Agonist type pharmacotherapies have been used successfully to treat opioid and nicotine dependence and are being studied for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence. One potential candidate is lisdexamfetamine, a pro-drug for dexamphetamine, which has a longer lasting therapeutic action with a lowered abuse potential. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of lisdexamfetamine in this population at doses higher than those currently approved for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or binge eating disorder.--NEW SECTION--This is a phase 2 dose escalation study of lisdexamfetamine for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence. Twenty individuals seeking treatment for methamphetamine dependence will be recruited at two Australian drug and alcohol services. All participants will undergo a single-blinded ascending-descending dose regime of 100 to 250 mg lisdexamfetamine, dispensed daily on site, over an 8-week period. Participants will be offered counselling as standard care. For the primary objectives the outcome variables will be adverse events monitoring, drug tolerability and regimen completion. Secondary outcomes will be changes in methamphetamine use, craving, withdrawal, severity of dependence, risk behaviour and other substance use. Medication acceptability, potential for non-prescription use, adherence and changes in neurocognition will also be measured.--NEW SECTION--Determining the safety of lisdexamfetamine will enable further research to develop pharmacotherapies for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence.--NEW SECTION--Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12615000391572 Registered 28th April 2015.",eng,BMC psychiatry,"Clinical Trial, Phase II",2025-04-23,2016

Further, inconsistent results exist for the relationships of anthropometric measures with blood pressure and hypertension, and whether these relationships differ substantially by age and sex is unclear. We aimed to elucidate the associations of anthropometric measures of general and central adiposity with blood pressure and hypertension, and determine the effect of age and sex on these relationships.--NEW SECTION--We used cross-sectional data from the Centre for Global Health Research health check-up survey conducted during 2006-2007 of the general population in India (n = 7 601; age 18-59 years). We examined the associations of anthropometric measures (body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-hip ratio, waist-height ratio) with blood pressure components (systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, mid-blood pressure) and hypertension within four (18-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years) age groups, by sex. We adjusted all analyses for education and location, with further adjustments, variously, for either a measure of central (waist circumference) or general (body mass index) adiposity.--NEW SECTION--On average, every 5 kg/m2 greater body mass index or 10 cm wider waist circumference was associated with a 5 and 4 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure, respectively. When considered separately, each anthropometric measure was strongly and positively associated with most blood pressure components in all age groups, and for both sexes. However, with few exceptions, when considered jointly (body mass index adjusted for waist circumference), the associations of body mass index with blood pressure components and hypertension were greatly diminished for both sexes, and particularly in the ≥30 years age groups. By contrast, further adjustment of waist circumference for body mass index did not materially alter the associations of waist circumference with blood pressure components and hypertension.--NEW SECTION--Our findings indicate that central adiposity, as assessed with anthropometric measures, may be a more important determinant of blood pressure and hypertension than general adiposity for adults in India.",eng,BMC cardiovascular disorders,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Studies that examine attitudes towards people living with HIV (PLWH), individual risk perception of acquiring HIV amongst Ecuadorians, and the ways in which levels of risk perception may affect risk behaviors are lacking. This qualitative study aimed to fill this gap in the literature by investigating these issues in the rural, coastal community of Manglaralto, Ecuador, which has among the highest incidence of HIV in Ecuador. We conducted interviews with 15 patients at Manglaralto Hospital. Analysis of interview transcripts revealed widespread negative attitudes towards PLWH, prevalent risk behaviors such as multiple sex partners and lack of condom use, and low individual risk-perception of contracting HIV.

Although the relationship between obesity and T2DM is well established, the common molecular pathomechanisms are still under investigation. Recently, it has been suggested that epigenetic modifications may be involved in both obesity and T2DM development. Epigenetics plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by the reversible modifications of chromatin structure without any changes in DNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, posttranslational histone modifications and miRNA interference. Therefore, the aim of this article is to discuss the current knowledge on epigenetic modifications in adipose tissue and their association with obesity and T2DM.",eng,Archives of medical science : AMS,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Population attributable fractions were derived and used to calculate the number of attributable deaths. Observational studies published upto 2015 were identified through MEDLINE, IndMED, Google Scholar and other databases. Data on the prevalence of SLT use was obtained from latest reports or national surveys. Data on the disease burden were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study. Hospital-based or community-based case-control and cohort studies that adjusted for the smoking status were included.--NEW SECTION--16 studies that provided estimates for mortality due to all cause, all cancer, upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancer, stomach cancer, cervical cancer, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke were included. A significant association was found for mortality due to all cause (1.22; 1.11-1.34), all cancer (1.31; 1.16-1.47), UADT cancer (2.17; 1.47-3.22), stomach cancer (1.33; 1.12-1.59), cervical cancer (2.07; 1.64-2.61), IHD (1.10; 1.04-1.17) and stroke (1.37; 1.24-1.51). Subgroup analysis showed major regional differences. Globally, the number of attributable deaths from all-cause mortality was 652 494 (234 008-1 081 437), of which 88% was borne by the South-East Asian region.--NEW SECTION--SLT is responsible for a large number of deaths worldwide with the South-East Asian region bearing a substantial share of the burden.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2018

Eastern Europe has some of the highest incidences of DR-TB, particularly multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. To better understand the genetic composition and evolution of MDR- and XDR-TB in the region, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 138 M. tuberculosis isolates from 97 patients sampled between 2010 and 2013 in Minsk, Belarus. MDR and XDR-TB isolates were significantly more likely to belong to the Beijing lineage than to the Euro-American lineage, and known resistance-conferring loci accounted for the majority of phenotypic resistance to first- and second-line drugs in MDR and XDR-TB. Using a phylogenomic approach, we estimated that the majority of MDR-TB was due to the recent transmission of already-resistant M. tuberculosis strains rather than repeated de novo evolution of resistance within patients, while XDR-TB was acquired through both routes. Longitudinal sampling of M. tuberculosis from 34 patients with treatment failure showed that most strains persisted genetically unchanged during treatment or acquired resistance to fluoroquinolones. HIV+ patients were significantly more likely to have multiple infections over time than HIV- patients, highlighting a specific need for careful infection control in these patients. These data provide a better understanding of the genomic composition, transmission, and evolution of MDR- and XDR-TB in Belarus and will enable improved diagnostics, treatment protocols, and prognostic decision-making.",eng,Journal of clinical microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

These clusters were reported concurrently with an outbreak of ZIKV, which has been ongoing in Brazil and other countries in the America region since 2015. A growing body of clinical and epidemiological data possibly leans towards a causal role for ZIKV as the occurrence of the clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders principally the Guillain-Barre' syndrome are associated in time and place with the ongoing ZIKV transmission in the America region. So far, Zika viral transmission has been documented in a total of 69 countries and territories with autochthonous transmission from 20I7 to 10 August 2016. The geographical range of ZIKV has been increasing steadily. Consid'ring the presence of competent vectors that transmit ZIKV in, some parts of the Gulf countries, and the close relationship with Brazil, a local transmission of the virus is plausible once the virus is introduced through travel. This review suggests the integration of epidemiologicalind entomological surveillance for monitoring and control of the vectors of ZIKV. The risks associated with ZIKV infection and the possible threat to the Gulf States was described. A strategic Zika response framework (SRF) for the Gulf States has been developed to meet'their,urgent need for a collaborative and coordinated response for prevention and spread of ZIKV infection.

Models are estimated in a stochastic framework with recent Bayesian techniques. R0 for the Pacific ZIKV epidemics is estimated between 1.5 and 4.1, the smallest islands displaying higher and more variable values. This relatively low range of R0 suggests that intervention strategies developed for other flaviviruses should enable as, if not more effective control of ZIKV.

Chronic HCV infection pursues a progressive course that ultimately results in the development of cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), if left untreated. The efficiency and tolerability of therapeutical approaches improved considerably with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAA). The majority of patients treated with the recommended DAA combinations can be cured, which is reflected in achievement of sustained virological response (SVR).

Ideas from the 'waiting room of history'.,"Around the world there is growing interest in the manner in which care is delivered to people at the end of life. However, there is little unanimity on what constitutes a 'good death' and the appropriate societal responses to the issue of delivering culturally relevant and sustainable forms of end of life care in different settings are not subjects of broad agreement. In this critical conceptual paper we focus on the emerging narratives of global palliative care and offer an assessment of their implications. We relate this to calls to improve end of life care across jurisdictions and settings, attempts to map and grade the development of palliative care provision, and to the emergence of a widely recognised global 'quality of death index'. We consider an alternative approach to framing this debate, drawn from a subaltern and post-colonial studies perspective and suggest that adopting a truly global perspective will require acceptance of the plurality of past and present local problems and issues relating to end of life care, as well as the plural possibilities of how they might be overcome. In that context, we would not aim to universalise or privilege one particular global future for end of life care.

Human development index (HDI) in 2013 as a national socioeconomic indicator was obtained from the Human Development Report. Kruskal-Wallis test and linear regression were performed to explore the association between age-standardized DALY rates and HDI.--NEW SECTION--From 1990 to 2013, global DALY numbers caused by URE rose by 43.8%, crude rates remained relatively constant, and age-standardized rates fell by 8.8%. Global DALY rates increased with age, and older females had higher DALY numbers and rates than males of the same age. Age-standardized DALY rates in Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and Africa were higher than that at a global level.

Chronic smoking has a direct impact on quality of life and life expectancy. Repeated environmental exposure and smoke inhalation can be deleterious to health. In order to evaluate the core functioning of the lungs, Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) are conducted. This panel of tests should be advised for all patients complaining of shortness of breath. Since clinical features resulting from chronic smoking tend to appear late in the course of the disease, PFTs are immensely useful for early identification of abnormalities in asymptomatic adult smokers. Numerous studies have shown that normal PFT parameters begin to deteriorate immediately after smoking is initiated. However, most physicians prefer to wait for characteristic signs and symptoms of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to develop before proceeding with PFTs in the patients. This leads to inadvertent and often dangerous delay in reaching a definitive diagnosis and initiating treatment. Therefore, we undertook this review to determine whether conducting PFTs in asymptomatic adult smokers can facilitate the early detection and/or prevention of COPD. We reviewed and analyzed articles from PubMed, Google Scholar, Index Medicus, WHO Global Health Library and Scopus, which specifically demonstrated the presence of abnormal PFT changes in asymptomatic adult smokers. With PFTs, we now have the advantage of diagnosing early changes in the lung volumes. Hence, we conclude that PFTs should be performed early in smokers and cessation of smoking should be encouraged to check the increasing incidence of COPD.",eng,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,Review,2025-04-23,2016

Natural antimicrobial peptides and their synthetic derivatives, including peptoids and peptidomimetics, are promising candidates as novel antibiotics. Recently, the C-terminal glycine-rich fragments of human epithelial keratin 6A were found to have bactericidal and cytoprotective activities. Here, we used an improved 2-dimensional NMR method coupled with a new protocol for structural refinement by low temperature simulated annealing to characterize the solution structure of these kerain-derived antimicrobial peptides (KAMPs). Two specific KAMPs in complex with membrane mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles displayed amphipathic conformations with only local bends and turns, and a central 10-residue glycine-rich hydrophobic strip that is central to bactericidal activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-αβ structure for human antimicrobial peptides. Direct observation of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that KAMPs deformed bacterial cell envelopes and induced pore formation. Notably, in competitive binding experiments, KAMPs demonstrated binding affinities to LPS and LTA that did not correlate with their bactericidal activities, suggesting peptide-LPS and peptide-LTA interactions are less important in their mechanisms of action. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of KAMPs-bacterial factor complexes indicated that membrane surface lipoprotein SlyB and intracellular machineries NQR sodium pump and ribosomes are potential molecular targets for the peptides.

Intranasal steroid (INS) is the first treatment choice in the majority of patients, because of its ability to effectively control allergic symptoms. However, patients and clinicians are concerned about the potential adverse effects of prolonged INS use.--NEW SECTION--We performed to review for evaluating systemic and local safety of INS use, by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library database for identification of relevant articles.--NEW SECTION--In the present study, the systemic bioavailabilities of several commercially available INSs were researched, and then systemic safeties were reviewed with focus on suppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and their effects on pediatric growth. In addition, local adverse effects, such as, epistaxis and nasal septal perforation, were investigated.

Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem. In Europe, hypovitaminosis D is even more prevalent. Vitamin D deficiency plays a significant role in a dozens of numerous disorders.--NEW SECTION--The cross-sectional epidemiological analysis was performed, and data were statistically analyzed. A total of 2483 screened individuals were examined for the serum 25(OH)D concentrations. The cutoff points that we used was <20 ng/mL.--NEW SECTION--Among 2483 examined patients for vitamin D level, females were in majority with 76% and males with 24% in total. Deficient vitamin D level was found in 60.6% of patients, and insufficient vitamin D level was detected in 21.4%. The highest rate of severe deficiency was found among elderly people (32.9%). In total, the decreased level of vitamin D concentration in Bosnia and Herzegovina is 82%.--NEW SECTION--Vitamin D serum concentrations in Bosnia and Herzegovina are decreased in a majority of study population, and the results are within the average levels compared to other countries, particularly to findings in Central Europe.

Arguing for a change in terminology extends beyond pedantry as the move carries serious implications for the public health community and the general public. Additional resources are unlocked once a disease reaches pandemic proportions and, as a long-neglected and underfunded group of conditions, NCDs desperately require a renewed sense of focus and political attention.

We present the first global suitability model of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and demonstrate that reliable predictions can be obtained at global scale. Best predictions are obtained using spatial predictor variables describing host distributions, rather than land use or eco-climatic spatial predictor variables, with a strong association with domestic duck and extensively raised chicken densities. Our results also support a more systematic use of spatial cross-validation in large-scale disease suitability modelling compared to standard random cross-validation that can lead to unreliable measure of extrapolation accuracy. A global suitability model of the H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses, a group of viruses that recently spread extensively in Asia and the US, shows in comparison a lower spatial extrapolation capacity than the HPAI H5N1 models, with a stronger association with intensively raised chicken densities and anthropogenic factors.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, studies to support health policies and place monitoring systems to tackle socioeconomic inequalities in smoking and smokeless tobacco use common in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) are seldom reported. We aimed to describe, sex-wise, educational and wealth-related inequalities in tobacco use in LMICs.--NEW SECTION--We analysed Demographic and Health Survey data on tobacco use collected from large nationally representative samples of men and women in 54 LMICs. We estimated the weighted prevalence of any current tobacco use (including smokeless tobacco) in each country for 4 educational groups and 4 wealth groups. We calculated absolute and relative measures of inequality, that is, the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII), which take into account the distribution of prevalence across all education and wealth groups and account for population size. We also calculated the aggregate SII and RII for low-income (LIC), lower-middle-income (lMIC) and upper-middle-income (uMIC) countries as per World Bank classification.--NEW SECTION--Male tobacco use was highest in Bangladesh (70.3%) and lowest in Sao Tome (7.4%), whereas female tobacco use was highest in Madagascar (21%) and lowest in Tajikistan (0.22%). Among men, educational inequalities varied widely between countries, but aggregate RII and SII showed an inverse trend by country wealth groups. RII was 3.61 (95% CI 2.83 to 4.61) in LICs, 1.99 (95% CI 1.66 to 2.38) in lMIC and 1.82 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.67) in uMIC. Wealth inequalities among men varied less between countries, but RII and SII showed an inverse pattern where RII was 2.43 (95% CI 2.05 to 2.88) in LICs, 1.84 (95% CI 1.54 to 2.21) in lMICs and 1.67 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.42) in uMICs. For educational inequalities among women, the RII varied much more than SII varied between the countries, and the aggregate RII was 14.49 (95% CI 8.87 to 23.68) in LICs, 3.05 (95% CI 1.44 to 6.47) in lMIC and 1.58 (95% CI 0.33 to 7.56) in uMIC. Wealth inequalities among women showed a pattern similar to that of men: the RII was 5.88 (95% CI 3.91 to 8.85) in LICs, 1.76 (95% CI 0.80 to 3.85) in lMIC and 0.39 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.64) in uMIC. In contrast to men, among women, the SII was pro-rich (higher smoking among the more advantaged) in 13 of the 52 countries (7 of 23 lMIC and 5 of 7 uMIC).--NEW SECTION--Our results confirm that socioeconomic inequalities tobacco use exist in LMIC, varied widely between the countries and were much wider in the lowest income countries.

Because QoL has a relevant impact on guideline-adherent treatment, elderly breast cancer patients are often undertreated, especially with regard to adjuvant chemotherapy, and overall survival is decreased. Thus, understanding the impact of chemotherapy on QoL in elderly patients is crucial. This study compared QoL in patients aged < 65 years and 65 to 70 years receiving adjuvant chemotherapy as a secondary outcome in the prospective randomized multicenter ADEBAR trial.--NEW SECTION--Patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer were prospectively randomized for either sequential anthracycline-taxane or epirubicin/fluorouracil/cyclophosphamid chemotherapy (FEC) therapy. QoL was assessed at baseline (t1), before cycle 4 FEC, and cycle 5 epirubicin/cyclophosphamid-docetaxel (EC-DOC) (t2), 4 weeks after chemotherapy (t3), and 6 weeks after radiation (t4) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the Breast Cancer-Specific Module (QLQ-BR23). We compared patients aged < 65 years and 65 to 70 years with respect to QoL and discontinuation of chemotherapy.--NEW SECTION--A total of 1363 patients were enrolled onto the ADEBAR trial, with 16.7% of the patients aged 65 to 70 years. In elderly patients, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was higher and global health status and physical functioning were lower at baseline. Global health status decreased between t1 and t3 by 7 points in patients < 65 years and by 11 points in patients 65 to 70 years, and physical functioning decreased in the same period by 13.4 points in patients aged < 65 years and by 15.9 points in patients 65 to 70 years. In both groups, at t4 global health status exceeded baseline by 6 points, and physical functioning was 1.3 points under baseline in patients < 65 years old and 3 points under baseline in patients 65 to 70 years. There was a trend to more fatigue in elderly patients and to more nausea and vomiting while receiving chemotherapy in younger patients at t3. There was a higher dropout rate in patients aged 65 to 70 years (25.7%) than in patients aged < 65 years (16.2%).--NEW SECTION--There were only small or trivial differences in QoL in patients aged < 65 years versus 65 to 70 years who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, although the dropout rate from chemotherapy was notably higher in elderly breast cancer patients.",eng,Clinical breast cancer,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2017

The aim of this study is to provide an analysis of the global health education (GHE) capacity in Germany as well as to identify gaps, barriers and future strategies.--NEW SECTION--An online search in combination with information provided by student representatives, course coordinators and lecturers was used to create an overview of the current GHE landscape in Germany. Additionally, a semi-structured questionnaire was sent to GHE educators and students engaged in global health (GH) to assess the capacity of German GHE, its barriers and suggested strategies for the future.--NEW SECTION--A total of 33 GHE activities were identified at 18 German universities. Even though medical schools are the main provider of GHE (42%), out of 38 medical schools, only 13 (34%) offer any kind of GHE. Modules offered for students of other health-related professions constitute 27% of all activities. Most survey respondents (92%, n = 48) consider current GHE activities in Germany insufficient. Suggested formats were GHE as part of medical curricula (82%, n = 45) and dual degree MD/MPH or PhD programs. Most important barriers mentioned were low priority of GH at faculties and academic management levels (n = 41, 75%) as well as lack of necessary institutional structures (n = 33, 60%).--NEW SECTION--Despite some innovative academic approaches, there is clearly a need for more systematic GHE in Germany.

Gait is complex, comprised of multiple characteristics sensitive to survival, age and pathology. Due to covariance amongst characteristics, conceptual gait models have been established to reduce redundancy and aid interpretation. Previous models have been derived from laboratory gait assessments which are costly in equipment and time. Body-worn monitors (BWM) allow for free-living, low-cost and continuous gait measurement and produce similar covariant gait characteristics. A BWM gait model from both controlled and free-living measurement has not yet been established, limiting utility.--NEW SECTION--103 control and 67 PD participants completed a controlled laboratory assessment; walking for two minutes around a circuit wearing a BWM. 89 control and 58 PD participants were assessed in free-living, completing normal activities for 7 days wearing a BWM. Fourteen gait characteristics were derived from the BWM, selected according to a previous model. Principle component analysis derived factor loadings of gait characteristics.--NEW SECTION--Four gait domains were derived for both groups and conditions; pace, rhythm, variability and asymmetry. Domains totalled 84.84% and 88.43% of variance for controlled and 90.00% and 93.03% of variance in free-living environments for control and PD participants respectively. Gait characteristic loading was unambiguous for all characteristics apart from gait variability which demonstrated cross-loading for both groups and environments.

Furthermore, the time to identify a positive sputum culture is an important risk factor for the spread of tuberculosis, and several factors can predict a prolonged time to culture conversion. Moreover, the relationship between poor nutritional status and infectious disease is clearly established. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and sputum culture conversion within 3 months among patients with MDR-TB.--NEW SECTION--We retrospectively evaluated 218 patients with MDR-TB who were treated at a large tuberculosis referral hospital in South Korea between January 2005 and December 2010.

To take advantage of neural plasticity, early identification of affected infants is critical. The cardiac orienting response (COR) has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and is an inexpensive, easy to administer assessment tool. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the COR effectiveness in assessing individual risk of developmental delay.--NEW SECTION--As part of an ongoing longitudinal cohort study in Ukraine, live-born infants of women with some to heavy amounts of alcohol consumption in pregnancy were recruited and compared to infants of women who consumed low or no alcohol. At 6 and 12 months, infants were evaluated with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II. CORs were also collected during a habituation/dishabituation learning paradigm. Using a supervised logistic regression classifier, we compared the predictive utility of the COR indices to that of the 6-month Bayley scores for identification of developmental delay based on 12-month Bayley scores. Heart rate collected at each second (Standard COR) was compared to key features (Key COR) extracted from the response.--NEW SECTION--Negative predictive values (NPV) were 85% for Standard COR, 82% for Key COR, and 77% for the Bayley, and positive predictive values (PPV) were 66% for Standard COR, 62% for Key COR, and 43% for the Bayley.--NEW SECTION--Predictive analysis based on the COR resulted in better NPV and PPV than the 6-month Bayley score. As the resources required to obtain a Bayley score are substantially more than in a COR-based paradigm, the findings are suggestive of its utility as an early scalable screening tool based on the COR. Further work is needed to test its long-term predictive accuracy.",eng,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Cigarette smoking remains a global health epidemic with associated detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system. In this work, we investigated the effects of cigarette smoke exposure on cardiovascular system in an animal model. The study then evaluated the effects of antioxidants (AO), represented by pomegranate juice, on cigarette smoke induced cardiovascular injury. This study aims at evaluating the effect of pomegranate juice supplementation on the cardiovascular system of an experimental rat model of smoke exposure. Methods: Adult rats were divided into four different groups: Control, Cigarette smoking (CS), AO, and CS + AO. Cigarette smoke exposure was for 4 weeks (5 days of exposure/week) and AO group received pomegranate juice while other groups received placebo. Assessment of cardiovascular injury was documented by assessing different parameters of cardiovascular injury mediators including: (1) cardiac hypertrophy, (2) oxidative stress, (3) expression of inflammatory markers, (4) expression of Bradykinin receptor 1 (Bdkrb1), Bradykinin receptor 2 (Bdkrb2), and (5) altered expression of fibrotic/atherogenic markers [(Fibronectin (Fn1) and leptin receptor (ObR))]. Results: Data from this work demonstrated that cigarette smoke exposure induced cardiac hypertrophy, which was reduced upon administration of pomegranate in CS + AO group. Cigarette smoke exposure was associated with elevation in oxidative stress, significant increase in the expression of IL-1β, TNFα, Fn1, and ObR in rat's aorta. In addition, an increase in aortic calcification was observed after 1 month of cigarette smoke exposure. Furthermore, cigarette smoke induced a significant up regulation in Bdkrb1 expression level. Finally, pomegranate supplementation exhibited cardiovascular protection assessed by the above findings and partly contributed to ameliorating cardiac hypertrophy in cigarette smoke exposed animals. Conclusion: Findings from this work showed that cigarette smoking exposure is associated with significant cardiovascular pathology such as cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, pro-fibrotic, and atherogenic markers and aortic calcification in an animal model as assessed 1 month post exposure. Antioxidant supplementation prevented cardiac hypertrophy and attenuated indicators of atherosclerosis markers associated with cigarette smoke exposure.",eng,Frontiers in pharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Criticism of WHO's performance grew louder in the outbreak's wake, placing this international health UN-specialized agency in the difficult position of navigating a complex series of reform recommendations put forth by different stakeholders. Decisions on WHO governance reform and the broader role of the United Nations could very well shape the future landscape of 21st century global health and how the international community responds to health emergencies.--NEW SECTION--In order to better understand the implications of the EVD outbreak on global health and infectious disease governance, this debate article critically examines a series of reports issued by four high-level commissions/panels convened to specifically assess WHO's performance post-Ebola. Collectively, these recommendations add increasing complexity to the urgent need for WHO reform, a process that the agency must carry out in order to maintain its legitimacy. Proposals that garnered strong support included the formation of an independent WHO Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response, the urgent need to increase WHO infectious disease funding and capacity, and establishing better operational and policy coordination between WHO, UN agencies, and other global health partners. The recommendations also raise more fundamental questions about restructuring the global health architecture, and whether the UN should play a more active role in global health governance. Despite the need for a fully modernized WHO, reform proposals recently announced by WHO fail to achieve the ""evolution"" in global health governance needed in order to ensure that global society is adequately protected against the multifaceted and increasingly complex nature of modern public health emergencies. Instead, the lasting legacy of the EVD outbreak may be its foreshadowing of a governance ""shift"" in formal sharing of the complex responsibilities of global health, health security, outbreak response, and managing health emergencies to other international structures, most notably the United Nations.

27880878,10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.11.015,Neurocysticercosis infection and disease-A review.,"Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the most common parasitic disease of the human central nervous system (CNS), a pleomorphic disease with a diverse array of clinical manifestations. The infection is pleomorphic and dependent on a complex range of interconnecting factors, including number and size of the cysticerci, their stage of development and localisation within the brain with resulting difficulties in accurate diagnosis and staging of the disease. This review examines the factors that contribute to the accurate assessment of NCC distribution and transmission that are critical to achieving robust disease burden calculations. Control and prevention of T. solium transmission should be a key priority in global health as intervention can reduce the substantial healthcare and economic burdens inflicted by both NCC and taeniasis. Surveillance systems need to be better established, including implementing obligatory notification of cases. In the absence of reliable estimates of its global burden, NCC will remain-along with other endemic zoonoses, of low priority in the eyes of funding agencies-a truly neglected disease.",eng,Acta tropica,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Two contributory factors to these challenges are the shortage of dental practitioners and the characteristic separation between the medical and dental professions. Nurses and midwives, in particular, are in a potentially excellent position to assist in basic oral health services such as dental health education and intraoral screening. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of integrating promotion of oral health of young children and their mothers into nursing and midwifery practice.--NEW SECTION--Seven electronic databases including CENTRAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, GLOBAL HEALTH, CINHAL, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched whereas conference proceedings and theses were retrieved via PROQUEST. Only randomized, non-randomized trials and observational studies on preventive oral health programs delivered by nurses or midwives in healthcare settings or through home visits were included. Two investigators reviewed full-text articles independently to decide on eligibility for inclusion. Quality assessment was done using Cochrane tool for risk of bias for randomized trials and Downs and Black assessment tool for all other studies. Out of 3162 retrieved records, twenty one trials on oral health interventions incorporated into standard nursing practice were reviewed. Eighteen programs reported significant positive outcomes including reduction in caries experience, better oral hygiene and dietary habits and increased rates of dental visits amongst young children as reported by their caregivers.--NEW SECTION--Incorporating oral health promotion into nursing practice is a promising initiative for reducing oral health disparities by contributing to a downward trend in caries experience and increased access to dental care especially amongst the poor disadvantaged communities.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Research funders from high-income countries have an obligation of justice to support health research in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) that furthers such objectives. This paper investigates how their current funding schemes are designed to incentivise health systems research in LMICs that promotes health equity. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were performed with 16 grants officers working for 11 funders and organisations that support health systems research: the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, Comic Relief, Doris Duke Foundation, European Commission, International Development Research Centre, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, Research Council of Norway, Rockefeller Foundation, UK Department of International Development, UK Medical Research Council, and Wellcome Trust. Thematic analysis of the data demonstrates their funding schemes promote health systems research with (up to) five key features that advance health equity: being conducted with worst-off populations, focusing on research topics that advance equitable health systems, having LMIC ownership of the research agenda, strengthening LMIC research capacity, and having an impact on health disparities. The different types of incentives that encouraged proposed projects to have these features are identified and classified by their strength (strong, moderate, weak). It is suggested that research funders ought to create and maintain funding schemes with strong incentives for the features identified above in order to more effectively help reduce global health disparities.",eng,Developing world bioethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2018

The aim of this review article is to reiterate empirical evidence to support the argument that vitamin K should be mandatory for newborns in India and China, as well as in other countries with a high burden of neonatal deaths.--NEW SECTION--Studies were integrated from the PubMed/MEDLINE database search, as well as related literature available elsewhere.--NEW SECTION--Both India and China have been slow in adopting an effective program for administering vitamin K injections to newborns to prevent VKDB-related morbidity and mortality. VKDB cases in China and India have shown inadequate attention to routine use of vitamin K by injection.--NEW SECTION--While no reliable data are publicly available, the issue of VKDB is at last receiving some attention from the Chinese public health system as well as the Indian government. In both countries, routine vitamin K administration to newborns would prove to be a cost-effective intervention to reduce preventable neonatal morbidity and mortality.

All countries have to face the phenomenon of population aging sooner or later depending on their degree of development; however, elderly care is predicted to soon become a major concern for developing countries such as Iran.--NEW SECTION--This study was conducted to identify the challenges of elderly care in Iran and to help policymakers develop roadmaps for the future through providing a clearer image of the current state of affairs in this area of healthcare.--NEW SECTION--This study has adopted a framework approach to qualitative data analysis. For this purpose, 37 semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2015 with a number of key informants in elderly care who were familiar with the process at macro-, meso-, and micro-levels. Maximum variation purposive sampling was performed to select the study samples. A conceptual framework was designed using a review of the literature, and key issues were then identified for data analysis.--NEW SECTION--The elderly care process yielded five major challenges, including policymaking, access, technical infrastructure, integrity and coordination, and health-based care services.--NEW SECTION--According to the stakeholders of elderly care in Iran, the current care system is not well-suited for meeting the needs of the elderly, as the elderly tend to receive the services they need sporadically and in a non-coherent manner.

In this study, soil samples were collected from three sites in petrochemical plant that represented different pollution levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Metagenomic profiling of these soils demonstrated that ARGs in the PAHs-contaminated soils were approximately 15 times more abundant than those in the less-contaminated ones, with Proteobacterial being the preponderant phylum. Resistance profile of ARGs in the PAHs-polluted soils was characterized by the dominance of efflux pump-encoding ARGs associated with aromatic antibiotics (e.g., fluoroquinolones and acriflavine) that accounted for more than 70% of the total ARGs, which was significantly different from representative sources of ARG pollution due to wide use of antibiotics. Most of ARGs enriched in the PAHs-contaminated soils were not carried by plasmids, indicating the low possibilities of them being transferred between bacteria. Significant correlation was observed between the total abundance of ARGs and that of Proteobacteria in the soils. Proteobacteria selected by PAHs led to simultaneously enriching of ARGs carried by them in the soils. Our results suggested that PAHs could serve as one of selective stresses for greatly enriching of ARGs in the human-impacted environment.",eng,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Fluoride can be obtained from different sources, with drinking water being a major contributor. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), bottled water is the major source for drinking. The aim of this research is to measure fluoride levels in different bottled water brands sold in UAE, to determine whether fluoride contributes to better health or health problems. The results were compared to international and local standards. Fluoride was present in seven out of 23 brands. One brand exhibited high fluoride levels, which exceeded all standards, suggesting it may pose health problems. Other brands were either below or above standards, suggesting either contribution to better health or health problems, depending on ingested amount. A risk assessment suggested a potential for non-cancer effects from some brands. The results were compared to fluoride levels in bottled water sold in UAE and neighboring countries (e.g. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain), over 24 years, to reflect on changes in fluoride levels in bottled water in this region. The research presents the need for creating, stricter regulations that require careful fluoride monitoring and new regulations that require listing fluoride level on the bottled water label, internationally and regionally.

The aim of this study was to determine the association between different types of tobacco use and earlier death in the Golestan Cohort Study.--NEW SECTION--The Study includes 50 045 adults (aged 40-75 years) from north eastern Iran. The baseline questionnaire (2004-2008) assessed information about use of cigarettes, chewing tobacco (nass) and waterpipe. To assess the use of each type of tobacco compared with never tobacco users, we used Cox regression models adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, area of residence, education and other tobacco used, and stratified by sex, ethnicity and opium use.--NEW SECTION--17% of participants reported a history of cigarette smoking, 7.5% chewing tobacco (nass) and 1.1% smoking waterpipe, and these figures declined in the later birth cohorts. During a median follow-up of 8 years, 4524 deaths occurred (mean age 64.8+9.9 years). Current (HR=1.44; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.61) and former (HR=1.35; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.56) cigarette smokers had higher overall mortality relative to never tobacco users. The highest cigarette-associated risk was for cancer death among current heavy smokers (HR=2.32; 95% CI 1.66 to 3.24). Current nass chewing was associated with overall mortality (HR=1.16; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.34), and there was a 61% higher risk of cancer death in people chewing nass more than five times a day.

Obesity during pregnancy is associated with a well-recognised increased risk of adverse health outcomes both for the woman and her infant. Currently available data from large scale randomised trials and systematic reviews highlight only modest effects of antenatal dietary and lifestyle interventions in limiting gestational weight gain, with little impact on clinically relevant pregnancy outcomes. Further information evaluating alternative strategies is required.

Inappropriate activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel occurs in these diarrheas. We previously reported that the benzopyrimido-pyrrolo-oxazinedione (R)-BPO-27 inhibits CFTR chloride conductance with low-nanomolar potency. Here, we demonstrate using experimental mouse models and human enterocyte cultures the potential utility of (R)-BPO-27 for treatment of secretory diarrheas caused by cholera and Escherichia coli enterotoxins. (R)-BPO-27 fully blocked CFTR chloride conductance in epithelial cell cultures and intestine after cAMP agonists, cholera toxin, or heat-stable enterotoxin of E. coli (STa toxin), with IC50 down to ∼5 nM. (R)-BPO-27 prevented cholera toxin and STa toxin-induced fluid accumulation in small intestinal loops, with IC50 down to 0.1 mg/kg. (R)-BPO-27 did not impair intestinal fluid absorption or inhibit other major intestinal transporters. Pharmacokinetics in mice showed >90% oral bioavailability with sustained therapeutic serum levels for >4 h without the significant toxicity seen with 7-d administration at 5 mg/kg/d. As evidence to support efficacy in human diarrheas, (R)-BPO-27 blocked fluid secretion in primary cultures of enteroids from human small intestine and anion current in enteroid monolayers.

Thus, in preparation for a first-in-human trial of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for septic shock, we applied systematic review methodology to evaluate all published preclinical evidence. We identified 20 controlled comparison experiments (980 animals from 18 publications) of in vivo sepsis models. Meta-analysis demonstrated that MSC treatment of preclinical sepsis significantly reduced mortality over a range of experimental conditions (odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.18-0.40, latest timepoint reported for each study). Risk of bias was unclear as few studies described elements such as randomization and no studies included an appropriately calculated sample size. Moreover, the presence of publication bias resulted in a ~30% overestimate of effect and threats to validity limit the strength of our conclusions.

NAFLD encompasses a range of conditions associated with hepatic steatosis, aberrant accumulation of fat in hepatocytes. Although obesity and metabolic syndrome are considered to have a strong association with NAFLD, genetic factors that predispose liver to NAFLD and molecular mechanisms by which excess hepatic lipid develops remain largely unknown. We report that the transcription cofactor CRTC1 confers broad spectrum protection against hepatic steatosis development. CRTC1 directly interferes with the expression of genes regulated by lipogenic transcription factors, most prominently liver x receptor α (LXRα). Accordingly, Crtc1 deficient mice develop spontaneous hepatic steatosis in young age. As a cyclic AMP effector, CRTC1 mediates anti-steatotic effects of calorie restriction (CR). Notably, CRTC1 also mediates anti-lipogenic effects of bile acid signaling, whereas it is negatively regulated by miR-34a, a pathogenic microRNA upregulated in a broad spectrum of NAFLD. These patterns of gene function and regulation of CRTC1 are distinct from other CR-responsive proteins, highlighting critical protective roles that CRTC1 selectively plays against NAFLD development, which in turn provides novel opportunities for selectively targeting beneficial therapeutic effects of CR.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Subsequently, the Schedule for clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry was used to ascertain ADs and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire (THE EORTC QLQ-C30) Version 3 with its breast specific supplement (QLQ-BR-23) was used to profile HRQoL in participants.--NEW SECTION--The mean age of participants was 49.6(±11.2) years, and 54% of participants had stage III and IV breast cancer. Findings on EORTC QLQ-C30 following univariate analyses showed association between ADs and poorer mean scores on global health status, functional domains including physical, emotional, social, and cognitive functions (p < 0.05). On the symptom scale, those with ADs had higher symptom load including fatigue, pain, insomnia, appetite loss, diarrhoea and financial difficulties (p < 0.05). Similarly, the QLQ-BR-23 showed correlation between ADs and poorer mean scores on breast cancer specific issues like body image, future perspectives, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, systemic therapy side-effects, upset by hair loss and breast symptoms (p < 0.05). Findings after controlling for age, treatment, cancer duration, recurrence and stage showed the same pattern of relationship between ADs and HRQoL; however, the global health status, cognition, sexual functioning, and higher symptom load with respect to appetite loss and financial difficulties were not independently related with ADs.--NEW SECTION--Scaling up of oncological services, supportive care and targeted psychosocial interventions are indicated for optimal outcome of breast cancer. Longitudinal research with focus on the complex relationship between HRQoL and ADs along with their modifiable determinants across the trajectories of breast cancer is warranted.",eng,"Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

To tackle these challenges, the Abbott RealTime MTB RIF/INH Resistance assay was developed to accelerate the diagnosis of rifampicin and/or isoniazid resistant tuberculosis to within a day. This article summarizes the performance of the Abbott RealTime MTB RIF/INH Resistance assay; including reliability, analytical sensitivity, and clinical sensitivity/specificity as compared to Cepheid GeneXpert MTB/RIF version 1.0 and Hain MTBDRplus version 2.0. The limit of detection (LOD) of the Abbott RealTime MTB RIF/INH Resistance assay was determined to be 32 colony forming units/milliliter (cfu/mL) using the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strain H37Rv cell line. For rifampicin resistance detection, the Abbott RealTime MTB RIF/INH Resistance assay demonstrated statistically equivalent clinical sensitivity and specificity as compared to Cepheid GeneXpert MTB/RIF. For isoniazid resistance detection, the assay demonstrated statistically equivalent clinical sensitivity and specificity as compared to Hain MTBDRplus.

27865379,10.1016/j.tube.2016.08.001,Antibodies and tuberculosis.,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem internationally, causing 9.6 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths worldwide in 2014. The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine is the only licensed vaccine against TB, but its protective effect does not extend to controlling the development of infectious pulmonary disease in adults. The development of a more effective vaccine against TB is therefore a pressing need for global health. Although it is established that cell-mediated immunity is necessary for the control of latent infection, the presupposition that such immunity is sufficient for vaccine-induced protection has recently been challenged. A greater understanding of protective immunity against TB is required to guide future vaccine strategies against TB. In contrast to cell-mediated immunity, the human antibody response against M.tb is conventionally thought to exert little immune control over the course of infection. Humoral responses are prominent during active TB disease, and have even been postulated to contribute to immunopathology. However, there is evidence to suggest that specific antibodies may limit the dissemination of M.tb, and potentially also play a role in prevention of infection via mucosal immunity. Further, antibodies are now understood to confer protection against a range of intracellular pathogens by modulating immunity via Fc-receptor mediated phagocytosis. In this review, we will explore the evidence that antibody-mediated immunity could be reconsidered in the search for new vaccine strategies against TB.",eng,"Tuberculosis (Edinburgh, Scotland)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The 2009 World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Health Risks report was used as a framework to determine which specific risk factors were present in each in these young people. The risk factors assessed in this study were smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, high blood glucose, high cholesterol and poor diet. Each risk factor was defined according to WHO criteria. A count of the total number of risk factors present for each participant was determined. Data for male and female participants were compared.--NEW SECTION--Young men had an average of 2.9 (SD 1.2) risk factors. Young women had an average of 2.4 (SD 1.2) risk factors. The most common risk factors were low fruit and vegetable intake (77.9%), cigarette smoking (67.7%), overweight/obesity (55%) and physical inactivity (39.8%). There were no significant differences between men and women in the number of risk factors present, or the prevalence of individual risk factors.--NEW SECTION--This study demonstrated that many of the risk factors that ultimately contribute to disability and premature death are present at an early age in people with psychosis.

It is documented that the overweight and obesity are major risk factors for a series of noncommunicable diseases, and in recent years, the obesity-cancer link has received much attention. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is associated with increased risk of several cancer types, including colon, breast, endometrium, liver, kidney, esophagus, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, and leukemia, and can also lead to poorer treatment. We review here the epidemiological and experimental evidences for the association between obesity and cancer. Specifically, we discuss potential mechanisms focusing how dysfunctional angiogenesis, chronic inflammation, interaction of proinflammatory cytokines, endocrine hormones, and adipokines including leptin, adiponectin insulin, growth factors, estrogen, and progesterone and strikingly, cell metabolism alteration in obesity participate in tumor development and progression, resistance to chemotherapy, and targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic and immune therapies.",eng,Cell biochemistry and function,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The HCV polymerase is responsible for the critical function of replicating the RNA genome of the virus. Transitions between at least two conformations (open and closed) are necessary to allow the enzyme to replicate RNA. In this study, molecular dynamic simulations were initiated from multiple crystal structures to understand the free energy landscape (FEL) explored by the enzyme as it interconverts between these conformations. Our studies reveal the location of distinct states within the FEL as well as the molecular interactions associated with these states. Specific hydrogen bonds appear to play a key role in modulating conformational transitions. This knowledge is essential to elucidate the role of these conformations in replication and may also be valuable in understanding the basis by which this enzyme is inhibited by small molecules. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",eng,Journal of computational chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

However, the risk factors are widespread and the number of at-risk population is also rising, which warrants special policy attention. The risks of transmission were shown to be correlated with the level of HIV knowledge of individuals. In this study, we aimed to explore the level and influencing factors of HIV knowledge among adult men in Bangladesh.--NEW SECTION--Data for the present study were collected from the sixth round of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Participants were 3305 men between 15 and 54 years of age regardless of HIV status. The primary outcome variable was the HIV knowledge score, which was calculated by responses to questions regarding general concepts and the mode of transmission of HIV. Association between the HIV knowledge score and the explanatory variables were analyzed by binary logistic regression methods.--NEW SECTION--The mean HIV knowledge score was 7.2 (SD 1.3). Results indicate that being an urban resident [p < 0.001; odds ratios (OR) = 0.56, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.48-0.64], having secondary/higher educational level (p < 0.001 OR = 0.56, 95%CI = 0.48-0.64), reading newspaper [p = 0.006; OR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.62-0.92], and communication with community health workers (CHWs) (p = 0.05; OR = 0.77, 95%CI = 0.60-10.00) were significantly associated with a high (equal or above mean value) HIV knowledge level.--NEW SECTION--The level of HIV knowledge among Bangladeshi men is low. Leveraging HIV awareness programs targeting adult men to prevent future expansion of the epidemic should be a high priority. Revitalization and restructuring of the education sector and strengthening CHW's engagement to improve knowledge about HIV transmission among men could generate beneficial returns for HIV prevention programs.",eng,Frontiers in public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Here, we aimed to analyse a universally applicable inactivation procedure, namely microwave irradiation, as a safe and effective method to reduce the risk of viral transmission. The exposure of HCV from different genotypes to microwave irradiation resulted in a significant reduction of viral infectivity. Furthermore, microwave irradiation reduced viral infectivity of HIV-1 and of HCV/HIV-1 suspensions indicating that this inactivation may be effective at preventing co-infections. To translate microwave irradiation as prevention method to used drug preparation equipment, we could further show that HCV as well as HIV-1 infectivity could be abrogated in syringes and filters. This study demonstrates the power of microwave irradiation for the reduction of viral transmission and establishment of this safety strategy could help reduce the transmission of blood-borne viruses.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The main targets in this study are the two nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) from Leishmania infantum chagasi that are the main etiologic agent of VL in the New World. These enzymes, called LicNTPDase1 and -2, are homologous to members 5 and 6 of the mammalian E-NTPDase/CD39 superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes hydrolyze nucleotides and accordingly can participate in the purine salvage pathways and in the modulation of purinergic signaling through the extracellular nucleotide-dependent host immune responses. They can therefore affect adhesion and infection of host cells and the parasite virulence. To further characterize these enzymes, in this work, we expressed LicNTPDase1 and -2 in the classical bacterial system Escherichia coli and mammalian cell system COS-7 cells. Our data demonstrate that changes in refolding after expression in bacteria can increase the activity of recombinant (r) rLicNTPDase2 up to 20 times but has no significant effect on rLicNTPDase1. Meanwhile, the expression in COS-7 led to a significant increase in activity for rLicNTPDase1.",eng,Protein expression and purification,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2017

It follows on from the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission, which concluded that the response to climate change could be ""the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century"". The Lancet Countdown aims to track the health impacts of climate hazards; health resilience and adaptation; health co-benefits of climate change mitigation; economics and finance; and political and broader engagement. These focus areas form the five thematic working groups of the Lancet Countdown and represent different aspects of the complex association between health and climate change. These thematic groups will provide indicators for a global overview of health and climate change; national case studies highlighting countries leading the way or going against the trend; and engagement with a range of stakeholders. The Lancet Countdown ultimately aims to report annually on a series of indicators across these five working groups. This paper outlines the potential indicators and indicator domains to be tracked by the collaboration, with suggestions on the methodologies and datasets available to achieve this end. The proposed indicator domains require further refinement, and mark the beginning of an ongoing consultation process-from November, 2016 to early 2017-to develop these domains, identify key areas not currently covered, and change indicators where necessary. This collaboration will actively seek to engage with existing monitoring processes, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and WHO's climate and health country profiles. The indicators will also evolve over time through ongoing collaboration with experts and a range of stakeholders, and be dependent on the emergence of new evidence and knowledge. During the course of its work, the Lancet Countdown will adopt a collaborative and iterative process, which aims to complement existing initiatives, welcome engagement with new partners, and be open to developing new research projects on health and climate change.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

We held focus groups with community healthcare workers to elicit their ideas about a mobile health application and used this input to build a prototype app. A pre-use test survey was administered to all participants, who subsequently use-tested the app on three different devices (iPhone, iPad mini, iPad Air). Usability was assessed by objectively scored data entry errors and through a post-use focus group held to gather open-ended feedback on end-user satisfaction.--NEW SECTION--All of the participants were women, ranging from 18-64 years old. A large percentage (85.7%) of participants had at least a high school education. Internet (92.8%), computer (85.7%) and cell phone (71.4%) use rates were high. Data entry error rates were also high, particularly in free text fields, ranging from 92.3 to 100%. Error rates were comparable across device type. In a post-use focus group, participants reported that they found the app easy to use and felt that its design was consistent with their vision. The participants raised several concerns, including that they did not find filling out the forms in the app to be a useful task. They also were concerned about an app potentially creating more work for them and personal security issues related to carrying a mobile device in low-income areas.--NEW SECTION--In a cohort of formally educated community healthcare workers with high levels of personal computer and cell phone use, we identified no technological barriers to adapting their existing work to a mobile device based system. Transferring current data entry work into a mobile platform, however, uncovered underlying dissatisfaction with some data entry tasks. This dissatisfaction may be a more significant barrier than the data entry errors our testing revealed.

This association between HIV and TB co-infection has been particularly evident amongst prisoners. However, despite this, few studies of TB in prisons have stratified results by HIV status. Given the high prevalence of HIV-positive persons and TB-infected persons in prisons and the documented risk of TB in those infected with HIV, it is of interest to determine how co-infection varies amongst prison populations worldwide. For this reason we have undertaken a systematic review of studies of co-infected prisoners to determine the incidence and/or prevalence of HIV/TB co-infection in prisons, as well as outcomes in this group, measured as treatment success or death.--NEW SECTION--A literature search was undertaken using the online databases PubMed, Embase, IBSS, Scopus, Web of Science, Global Health and CINAHL Plus. No restrictions were set on language or publication date for article retrieval, with articles included if indexed up to 18 October 2015. A total of 1975 non-duplicate papers were identified. For treatment and outcome data all eligible papers were appraised for inclusion; for incidence/prevalence estimates papers published prior to 2000 were excluded from full text review. After full text appraisal, 46 papers were selected for inclusion in the review, 41 for incidence/prevalence estimates and nine for outcomes data, with four papers providing evidence for both outcomes and prevalence/incidence.--NEW SECTION--Very few studies estimated the incidence of TB in HIV positive prisoners, with most simply reporting prevalence of co-infection. Co-infection is rarely explicitly measured, with studies simply reporting HIV status in prisoners with TB, or a cross-sectional survey of TB prevalence amongst prisoners with HIV. Estimates of co-infection prevalence ranged from 2.4 to 73.1% and relative risks for one, given the other, ranged from 2.0 to 10.75, although some studies reported no significant association between HIV and TB. Few studies provided a comparison with the risk of co-infection in the general population.--NEW SECTION--Prisoners infected with HIV are at high risk of developing TB. However, the magnitude of risk varies between different prisons and countries. There is little evidence on treatment outcomes in co-infected prisoners, and the existing evidence is conflicting in regards to HIV status influence on prisoner treatment outcomes.PROSPERO Number: CRD42016034068.",eng,Journal of the International AIDS Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

PCVs work in rural areas and contribute to locally determined public health initiatives.--NEW SECTION--We used a model of knowledge translation and implementation to train non-medical PCVs in HBB who would then train rural healthcare workers. Bulb suction and a self-inflating bag were donated to each health centre. We evaluated knowledge translation and behaviour change at 4 months using the Kirkpatrick model of evaluation.--NEW SECTION--Ten PCVs received training and then trained 42 healthcare workers in 10 rural health centres serving a combined population of over 1 million. Both PCVs and rural healthcare workers showed significant increases in knowledge and skills (p < 0.001).

This cross-sectional study included 138 individuals between 40 to 86 years old who were physically healthy and cognitively intact. Eleven markers (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, insulin, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, total protein) and five derived indicators (estimated glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance rate, insulin-resistance, average glucose, and cholesterol/HDL ratio) were obtained from blood sampling of all participants. T1-weighted 3T MRI scans were used to evaluate gray matter cortical thickness. The markers were clustered into five factors, and factor scores were related to cortical thickness by general linear model. Two factors, one linked to insulin/metabolic health and the other to kidney function (KFF) showed regionally selective associations with cortical thickness including lateral and medial temporal, temporoparietal, and superior parietal regions for both factors and frontoparietal regions for KFF. An association between the increasing cholesterol and greater thickness in frontoparietal and occipital areas was also noted. Associations persisted independently of age, presence of cardiovascular risk factors and ApoE gene status.

Our primary concern was to examine how religion, as a heuristic practice of Christian-based caregiving, was felt to be consequential in a direly underserved region. Part of a larger medical anthropological project, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 79 community home-based care clients, of whom half (53%) said they would have died, some from suicide, without its services. We utilized a critical phenomenological approach to interpret semantic and latent themes, and explicated these themes within a 'healthworld' framework. Participants were resolute that caregivers be Christian, less for ideological positioning than for perceived ontological sameness and ascribed traits: ""telling the truth"" about treatment, confidentiality, and an ethos of unconditional love that restored clients' desire to live and adhere to treatment. Findings are intended to help theorize phenomenological meanings of care, morality, health, and sickness, and to interrogate authoritative biomedically based rationalities that underwrite most HIV-related global health policy.",eng,Medical anthropology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

27843892,10.3389/fpubh.2016.00241,A Plea for Global Health Action Bottom-Up.,"This opinion piece focuses on global health action by hands-on bottom-up practice: initiation of an organizational framework and securing financial efficiency are - however - essential, both clearly a domain of well-trained public health professionals. Examples of action are cited in the four main areas of global threats: planetary climate change, global divides and inequity, global insecurity and violent conflicts, and global instability and financial crises. In conclusion, a stable health systems policy framework would greatly enhance success. However, such organizational framework dries out if not linked to public debates channeling fresh thoughts and controversial proposals: the structural stabilization is essential but has to serve not to dominate bottom-up activities. In other words, a horizontal management is required, a balanced equilibrium between bottom-up initiative and top-down support. Last but not least, rewarding voluntary and charity work by public acknowledgment is essential.",eng,Frontiers in public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Among the Aboriginal population of Canada (which includes the First Nations, Inuit and Metis), diabetes mellitus contribute significantly to their higher morbidity and increased health disparity when compared to the non-Aboriginal Canadians. In view of this, the Federal Government of Canada had launched the Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative (ADI) in 1999 as part of the bigger Canadian Diabetes Strategy to provide a better framework for surveillance, public education and community-based management of diabetes. Originally, ADI was intended for a 5-year cycle, but it was renewed twice in 2005 and then 2010, with a total funding of C$523 million. Given its long history of operation and the massive amount of revenue being injected, it is worthwhile to review the background information and the relevant data that had fostered the ADI; and more importantly, to critically evaluate the benefits and impact of the ADI in terms of the actual health of the Aboriginals and their social inequalities.",eng,Journal of family medicine and primary care,Review,2025-04-23,2016

The war against poverty requires not only financial support, but also poverty-related research to pinpoint areas of high need of intervention. In line with international efforts to fight poverty and negative consequences, we carried out this study to give a bibliometric overview of medicine-related literature on poverty. Such a s study is an indicator of the extent of interaction of various international key players on the war against poverty-related health problems.--NEW SECTION--Scopus was used to achieve the objective of this study. The time span set for this study was 2005-2015. Poverty-related articles under the subject area ""Medicine"" were used to give bibliometric indicators such as annual growth of publications, international collaboration, highly cited articles, active countries, institutions, journals, and authors.--NEW SECTION--The total number of retrieved articles was 1583. The Hirsh-index of retrieved articles was 56. A modest and fluctuating increase was seen over the study period. Visualization map of retrieved articles showed that ""HIV"", infectious diseases, mental health, India, and Africa were most commonly encountered terms. No significant dominance of any particular author or journal was observed in retrieved articles. The United States of America had the largest share in the number of published articles. The World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Prevention and Control were among top active institutions/organizations. International collaboration was observed in less than one third of publications. Top cited articles focused on three poverty-related health issues, mainly, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and child development/psychology. Most of top articles were published in high impact journals.--NEW SECTION--Data indicated that articles on poverty were published in high influential medical journals indicative of the importance of poverty as a global health problem.

Therefore, the objective of this review was to examine the degree of agreement of BP-measuring devices in Tibet.--NEW SECTION--We conducted electronic searches in Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Global Health Library and the ISI Web of Science. Randomised and observational studies were considered for inclusion. The methodological characteristics of included studies were assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 criteria. Our primary outcome was the difference in mean BP measurements between the new device and the gold standard.--NEW SECTION--We identified three eligible studies, out of which two with a total of 162 participants were included. The studies differed in their methodology. One study reported significantly higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurement with electronic sphygmomanometer (Omron) compared with mercury sphygmomanometer (mean difference 5.8±4.7 mm Hg; p<0.001), with no significant difference in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measurement (0.4±3.9 mm Hg; p=0.23). The second study reported mean differences of 1.0±5.9 mm Hg and -3.1±4.6 mm Hg for SBP and DBP, respectively.--NEW SECTION--The limited evidence from published studies suggests that automated (Omron) BP monitors show a high degree of agreement for DBP when compared against mercury sphygmomanometer at high altitudes. However, the degree of such agreement for SBP is not consistent. Few studies assessing the validity of automated BP monitors at high altitudes have been conducted, and they differ in design and methodology. Further research assessing the suitability of BP-measuring instruments at high altitudes is therefore warranted.",eng,Heart Asia,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Arthritis, often self-reported, is commonly cited as the reason for the use of medicinal herbal cannabis (marijuana). We have examined the prevalence of marijuana use among 1000 consecutive rheumatology patients with a rheumatologist-confirmed diagnosis and compared in an exploratory manner the clinical characteristics of medicinal users and nonusers. Current marijuana use, medicinal or recreational, was reported by 38 patients (3.8%; 95% CI: 2.8-5.2). Ever use of marijuana for medical purposes was reported by 4.3% (95% CI: 3.2-5.7), with 28 (2.8%; 95% CI: 1.9-4.0) reporting current medicinal use. Current medicinal users had a spectrum of rheumatic conditions, with over half diagnosed with osteoarthritis. Medicinal users were younger, more likely unemployed or disabled, and reported poorer global health. Pain report and opioid use was greater for users, but they had similar physician global assessment of disease status compared with nonusers. Medicinal users were more likely previous recreational users, with approximately 40% reporting concurrent recreational use. Therefore, less than 3% of rheumatology patients reported current use of medicinal marijuana. This low rate of use in patients with a rheumatologist-confirmed diagnosis is in stark contrast to the high rates of severe arthritis frequently reported by medicinal marijuana users, especially in Canada. Familiarity with marijuana as a recreational product may explain use for some as disease status was similar for both groups.",eng,Pain,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Key principles of PBL are, learning should be constructive, self-directed, collaborative, and contextual. The purpose is to explore whether these principles are applicable in blended learning.--NEW SECTION--The programs, Master of Health Services Innovation (case 1), Master Programme in Global Health (case 2), and the Master of Health Professions Education (case 3), used a Virtual Learning Environment for exchanging material and were independently analyzed. Quantitative data were collected for cases 1 and 2. Simple descriptive analyses such as frequencies were performed. Qualitative data for cases 1 and 3 were collected via (focus group) interviews.--NEW SECTION--All PBL principles could be recognized in case 1. Case 2 seemed to be more project-based. In case 3, collaboration between students was not possible because of a difference in time-zones. Important educational aspects: agreement on rules for (online) sessions; visual contact (student-student and student-teacher), and frequent feedback.--NEW SECTION--PBL in a blended learning format is perceived to be an effective strategy.

We therefore performed a Medline search of original research studies using the quality of life in epilepsy-31 inventory (QOLIE-31) in a recent fifteen-year period (2000-2015). Each of the 194 countries listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) was individually included as search terms. Differences in QOLIE were tested across WHO world regions and World Bank country income group classifications. Sixteen percent of all countries (n=31) reported on 7255 individuals, including only 8 LMICs. The global mean QOLIE-31 score was 59.8 (standard deviation (SD): 8.0), with a range from 42.1 (SD: 4.1) in the Russian Federation to 82 (SD: 32.8) in Canada. There was a statistically significant difference seen in the QOLIE-31 score by world region and income category, with lower country income level associated with worse QOL (test for trend, p<0.0001). There exists substantial global variation in QOLIE, and country income level may play a role.

Despite its significant impact on human health, there is currently a lack of highly effective treatments free of side effects for osteoporosis. Therefore, a major goal in the field is to identify new drug targets. Genetic discovery has been shown to be effective in the unbiased identification of novel drug targets and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have begun to provide insight into genetic basis of osteoporosis. Over the last decade, GWASs have led to the identification of ∼100 loci associated with BMD and other bone traits related to risk of fracture. However, there have been limited efforts to identify the causal genes underlying the GWAS loci or the mechanisms by which GWAS loci alter bone physiology. In this review, we summarize the current state of the field and discuss strategies for causal gene discovery and the evidence that the novel genes underlying GWAS loci are likely to be a new source of drug targets.",eng,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017
27837574,10.22365/jpsych.2016.273.204,There is no safe threshold for lead exposure: Α literature review.,"Lead was one of the most dangerous environmental toxic substances for a long time in western countries, and this is still the case for many places on earth today. Its neurotoxic potential is highly significant but its secure blood level concentration remains unknown. The aim of this study was to approach the above issue from the perspective of social psychiatry. A systematic search was made of Dialog and Datastar interfaces for data regarding the neuropsychiatric complications of direct or chronic exposure to lead, and a review of the relevant literature was conducted using the databases Medline, Embase, CAB Global Health and Cochrane. Lead affects the cholinergic, dopaminergic and gloutamergic systems, thus intervening in the normal function of neurotransmion. The consequence of neurotoxicity in the central nervous system includes apoptosis and excitotoxicity. Direct as well as chronic exposure causes serious neurological symptoms and possibly constant cognitive impairment. Acute encephalopathy, the most serious expression of lead poisoning, occurs in blood level concentrations over 100 μg/dL in adults and 80-100 μg/dL in children. Early symptoms of lead neurotoxicity include irritability, headaches and difficulties in concentration in both children and adults. Continuous exposure in children produces neurobehavioral symptoms, such as decreased concentration, inability to follow instructions, difficulty to play games and low IQ, which are associated with concentrations of 10-35 μg/dL. However, some studies claim that cognitive decline and low IQ can occur in concentrations <10 μg/dL. The commonest symptom in adults is peripheral neuropathy with foot drop. Prenatal exposure to lead has been correlated with antisocial behavior and schizophrenia. Long-term lead exposure causing low and medium lead concentration in blood has been linked to depression as well as generalized anxiety disorder and other behavioral disorders. High blood level concentrations correlate with psychotic symptoms like delusions and hallucinations but more rarely with psychotic syndromes. Despite the fact that lead has been banned from gasoline, paint and water pipes, quite significant quantities of lead still exist, particularly in deprived areas of modern cities, in transition zones and city centers, and there are also great concentrations around lead mines and in developing countries, but even for the remaining areas there is no safe threshold.--NEW SECTION--Lead was and still is an environmental factor that increases neurologic and psychiatric morbidity. It also causes developmental disorders, especially in deprived areas. Prevention should be the single most important way of dealing with lead poisoning.",eng,Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Relatively little attention has been given to processes needed to extract data on social determinants of health out of medical records with adequate validity and efficiency to facilitate analysis across individual encounters to inform population health efforts relevant to the health care sector. In this article we describe the rationale for extracting data on social determinants of health from EHRs, including the potential influence of aggregated data on quality improvement activities and health care payment reform. We then discuss opportunities and challenges to pulling these data from EHRs to enable population-level applications, focusing on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, as one potential data aggregation resource.

27834203,10.1128/mBio.01847-16,Predatory Bacteria Attenuate Klebsiella pneumoniae Burden in Rat Lungs.,"Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and Micavibrio aeruginosavorus are predatory bacteria that naturally-and obligately-prey on other Gram-negative bacteria, and their use has been proposed as a potential new approach to control microbial infection. The ability of predatory bacteria to prey on Gram-negative human pathogens in vitro is well documented; however, the in vivo safety and efficacy of predatory bacteria have yet to be fully assessed. In this study, we examined whether predatory bacteria can reduce bacterial burden in the lungs in an in vivo mammalian system. Initial safety studies were performed by intranasal inoculation of rats with predatory bacteria. No adverse effects or lung pathology were observed in rats exposed to high concentrations of predatory bacteria at up to 10 days postinoculation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of the immune response revealed a slight increase in inflammatory cytokine levels at 1 h postinoculation that was not sustained by 48 h. Additionally, dissemination experiments showed that predators were efficiently cleared from the host by 10 days postinoculation. To measure the ability of predatory bacteria to reduce microbial burden in vivo, we introduced sublethal concentrations of Klebsiella pneumoniae into the lungs of rats via intranasal inoculation and followed with multiple doses of predatory bacteria over 24 h. Predatory bacteria were able to reduce K. pneumoniae bacterial burden, on average, by more than 3.0 log10 in the lungs of most rats as measured by CFU plating. The work presented here provides further support for the idea of developing predatory bacteria as a novel biocontrol agent.--NEW SECTION--A widely held notion is that antibiotics are the greatest medical advance of the last 50 years. However, the rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections has become a global health crisis over the last decade. As we enter the postantibiotic era, it is crucial that we begin to develop new strategies to combat bacterial infection. Here, we report one such new approach: the use of predatory bacteria (Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and Micavibrio aeruginosavorus) that naturally-and obligately-prey on other Gram-negative bacteria. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrated the ability of predatory bacteria to attenuate the bacterial burden of a key human pathogen in an in vivo mammalian system. As the prevalence of MDR infections continues to rise each year, our results may represent a shift in how we approach treating microbial infections in the future.",eng,mBio,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Increased hazard was significant across geographic regions (sub-Saharan Africa: pHR 1.41 (1.28-1.56); Asia: 1.77 (1.42-2.21)) and persisted over time on treatment (≤12 months: 1.42 (1.21-1.67); 13-35 months: 1.48 (1.23-1.78); 36-59 months: 1.50 (1.18-1.91); 61 to 108 months: 1.49 (1.29-1.71)).--NEW SECTION--Men living with HIV have consistently and significantly greater hazards of all-cause mortality compared with women while on antiretroviral therapy in LMIC. This effect persists over time on treatment.

27833184,10.1080/00243639.2015.1123890,Neglecting human ecology: The common element of global health failures.,"Attempts to control malaria, AIDS, and maternal mortality in Africa have been woefully inadequate. This has involved adopting an almost exclusively technical preventive approach in the context of AIDS even though emphasizing human behavior holds the most promise. But on the other hand, it has also involved abandoning highly effective technical measures, as in the case of malaria. This suggests that the failure, at root, is anthropological in nature. The common element, it is argued here, is the failure to place the human ecology resolutely above destructive ideologies. Sound public-health approaches have been spurned in favor of predetermined preventive approaches in the service of ideological aims rather than of man and the common good. This article examines the ideological forces that have ultimately driven global health policy, and proposes that a more humane anthropology would be beneficial. Lay Summary: The scourges of malaria, AIDS, and maternal mortality have persisted in Africa, even though sensible and available means of addressing these epidemics, when stressed, have met with success. The reluctance to consistently emphasize the soundest public-health approaches-whether technical or behavioral in nature-indicate that global health policy has to a large extent been improperly concerned with advancing ideological agendas. The challenge we face today is not primarily technical but philosophical; the healing professions would perform a service by cultivating a higher view of man and an appreciation for objective moral truths that protect him.",eng,The Linacre quarterly,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27832149,10.1371/journal.pone.0166274,The Structure of Treponema pallidum Tp0624 Reveals a Modular Assembly of Divergently Functionalized and Previously Uncharacterized Domains.,"Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum is the causative agent of syphilis, a chronic, multistage, systemic infection that remains a major global health concern. The molecular mechanisms underlying T. pallidum pathogenesis are incompletely understood, partially due to the phylogenetic divergence of T. pallidum. One aspect of T. pallidum that differentiates it from conventional Gram-negative bacteria, and is believed to play an important role in pathogenesis, is its unusual cell envelope ultrastructure; in particular, the T. pallidum peptidoglycan layer is chemically distinct, thinner and more distal to the outer membrane. Established functional roles for peptidoglycan include contributing to the structural integrity of the cell envelope and stabilization of the flagellar motor complex, which are typically mediated by the OmpA domain-containing family of proteins. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern peptidoglycan binding and cell envelope biogenesis in T. pallidum we report here the structural characterization of the putative OmpA-like domain-containing protein, Tp0624. Analysis of the 1.70 Å resolution Tp0624 crystal structure reveals a multi-modular architecture comprised of three distinct domains including a C-terminal divergent OmpA-like domain, which we show is unable to bind the conventional peptidoglycan component diaminopimelic acid, and a previously uncharacterized tandem domain unit. Intriguingly, bioinformatic analysis indicates that the three domains together are found in all orthologs from pathogenic treponemes, but are not observed together in genera outside Treponema. These findings provide the first structural insight into a multi-modular treponemal protein containing an OmpA-like domain and its potential role in peptidoglycan coordination and stabilization of the T. pallidum cell envelope.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Quality of life during treatment and periods of subsequent remission is therefore vital. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was compared in relapsed CLL during and after treatment with ofatumumab combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide versus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 v3 and QLQ-CLL16 were used to assess HRQoL in this open-label, phase 3 study. Improvements in prespecified domains of patient-reported outcomes (Global Health Status [GHS]/HRQoL and B symptom scores) were recorded in both treatment arms after three cycles and were sustained after 18 months of follow-up. The two treatment arms were not significantly different at the nominal 0.05 level for GHS/HRQoL (p = .7278) or B symptoms (p = .5968). Small improvements in quality of life were maintained after therapy.

In this study we investigated the association of normal and abnormal thyroid hormone concentrations with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with primary brain tumors. Sixty-three patients (67% women and a mean age of 55.5 ± 13.8 years) before brain tumor surgery were evaluated for: (1) HRQoL using the EORTC questionnaire for cancer patients (QLQ-C30) and the Brain Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-BN20); (2) functional status (Barthel Index); and (3) clinical disease severity. Blood samples were obtained for assessment of thyroid hormone concentrations before surgery. After adjusting for the brain tumor histological diagnosis, patients' age, gender and functional status, lower thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations were associated with poor levels of functioning on the QLQ-C30 scales: physical functioning (β = 0.395, p < 0.001), role functioning (β = 0.334, p = 0.003) and cognitive functioning (β = 0.327, p = 0.009), and with greater QLQ-BN20 fatigue symptom severity (β = -0.406, p < 0.001). Lower free T3 concentrations were associated with worse HRQOL on the QLQ-C30 global health status (β = 0.302, p = 0.017), emotional functioning (β= 0.422, p < 0.001) and cognitive functioning (β= 0.259, p = 0.042) domains, and with greater symptom severity on the QLQ-BN20 fatigue (β = -0.238, p = 0.041), motor dysfunction (β = -0.283, p = 0.013) and weakness of legs (β = -0.269. p = 0.027) domains. In conclusion, reduced T3 and TSH hormone concentrations are associated with impaired emotional and physical aspects of HRQoL of primary brain tumor patients independent of brain tumor histological diagnosis, patients' age, gender and functional status.

Special emphasis is placed on cross-sector coordination to achieve policy goals, while improving health and well-being for all.[1] In Cuba's case, experience in disaster preparedness, particularly for hurricanes, has shown good cross-sector coordination.[2] Zika serves as another recent example. First identified in Uganda in 1947, Zika, an emerging disease with outbreaks in Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Americas and linked to neurological disorders in newborns, was declared a global health emergency by WHO on February 1, 2016.[3] In response, Cuba further stepped up measures for surveillance, prevention and control it had already announced in December 2015.

The wide host range of this organism is alarming and suggests a rising zoonotic emergency. However, knowledge on in-depth biology of this protist is still limited. Similar to the human pathogen, Trichomonas vaginalis, P. hominis possesses hydrogenosomes instead of mitochondria. Studies in T. vaginalis indicated that hydrogenosome is essential for cell survival and associated with numerous pivotal biological functions, including drug resistance. To further decipher the biology of this important organelle, we undertook proteomic research in P. hominis hydrogenosomes. Lacking a decoded P. hominis genome, we utilized an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data set generated from P. hominis axenic culture as the reference for proteome analysis. Using this in-house reference data set and mass spectrometry (MS), we identified 442 putative hydrogenosomal proteins. Interestingly, the composition of the P. hominis hydrogenosomal proteins is very similar to that of T. vaginalis, but proteins such as Hmp36, Pam16, Pam18, and Isd11 are absent based on both MS and the RNA-seq. Our data underscore that P. hominis expresses different homologs of multiple gene families from T. vaginalis. To the best of our knowledge, we present here the first hydrogenosome proteome in a protist other than T. vaginalis that offers crucial new scholarship for global health, therapeutics, diagnostics, and veterinary medicine research. In addition, the research strategy used here using RNA sequencing and proteomics might inform future multi-omics research in other understudied organisms without decoded genomes.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Metabolomics is a postgenomics field that offers fresh insights for biomarkers of common complex as well as rare diseases. Using data on metabolite-disease associations published in the previous decade (2006-2016) in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science, we identified 101 metabolites as putative biomarkers for these three neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, uric acid, choline, creatine, L-glutamine, alanine, creatinine, and N-acetyl-L-aspartate were the shared metabolite signatures among the three diseases. The disease-metabolite-pathway associations pointed out the importance of membrane transport (through ATP binding cassette transporters), particularly of arginine and proline amino acids in all three neurodegenerative diseases. When disease-specific and common metabolic pathways were queried by using the pathway enrichment analyses, we found that alanine, aspartate, glutamate, and purine metabolism might act as alternative pathways to overcome inadequate glucose supply and energy crisis in neurodegeneration. These observations underscore the importance of metabolite-based biomarker research in deciphering the elusive pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Future research investments in metabolomics of complex diseases might provide new insights on AD, PD, and ALS that continue to place a significant burden on global health.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The authors examine the two main macro-processes that influence development and health: the post-2015 Development Agenda and the process under way in the World Health Organization concerning research and development, intellectual property, and access to health inputs. The article concludes, first, that much remains to be done for the Agenda to truly represent a coherent and viable international political pact, and that the two macro-processes related to innovation in health need to be streamlined.

The TERMA framework is flexible and universal and consists of six independent LEGO building bricks to achieve high accuracy detection of biomedical events. Results recommend that the window sizes for the two moving averages ( W 1 and W 2 ) have to follow the inequality ( 8 × W 1 ) ≥ W 2 ≥ ( 2 × W 1 ) .

Its attractive properties of biodegradability and biocompatibility in vivo have contributed in a meaningful way to the approval of different products by the FDA and EMA for a wide range of biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, in the past two decades. This polymer has been widely used for the preparation of particles as delivery systems of several therapeutic molecules, including vaccines. These PLA vaccine carriers have shown to induce a sustained and targeted release of different bacterial, viral and tumor-associated antigens and adjuvants in vivo, triggering distinct immune responses. The present review intends to highlight and discuss the major advantages of PLA as a promising polymer for the development of potent vaccine delivery systems against pathogens and cancer. It aims to provide a critical discussion based on preclinical data to better understand the major effect of PLA-based carrier properties on their interaction with immune cells and thus their role in the modulation of host immunity.--NEW SECTION--During the last decades, vaccination has had a great impact on global health with the control of many severe diseases. Polymeric nanosystems have emerged as promising strategies to stabilize vaccine antigens, promoting their controlled release to phagocytic cells, thus avoiding the need for multiple administrations. One of the most promising polymers are the aliphatic polyesters, which include the poly(lactic acid). This is a highly versatile biodegradable and biocompatible polymer. Products containing this polymer have already been approved for all food and some biomedical applications. Despite all favorable characteristics presented above, PLA has been less intensively discussed than other polymers, such as its copolymer PLGA, including regarding its application in vaccination and particularly in tumor immunotherapy.

The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is an attractive target for a malaria vaccine, and forms a major component of RTS,S, the most clinically advanced malaria vaccine. The clinical efficacy of RTS,S has been moderate, yet has demonstrated the viability of a CSP-based malaria vaccine. In this study, a vaccine comprised of the full-length CSP antigen presented on a virus-like particle (VLP) is produced using a split-intein conjugation system (SpyTag/SpyCatcher) and the immunogenicity is tested in mice.--NEW SECTION--Full-length 3d7 CSP protein was genetically fused at the C-terminus to SpyCatcher. The CSP-SpyCatcher antigen was then covalently attached (via the SpyTag/SpyCatcher interaction) to Acinetobacter phage AP205 VLPs which were modified to display one SpyTag per VLP subunit. To evaluate the VLP-display effect, the immunogenicity of the VLP vaccine was tested in mice and compared to a control vaccine containing AP205 VLPs plus unconjugated CSP.--NEW SECTION--Full-length CSP was conjugated at high density (an average of 112 CSP molecules per VLP) to AP205 SpyTag-VLPs. Vaccination of mice with the CSP Spy-VLP vaccine resulted in significantly increased antibody titres over a course of 7 months as compared to the control group (2.6-fold higher at 7 months after immunization). Furthermore, the CSP Spy-VLP vaccine appears to stimulate production of IgG2a antibodies, which has been linked with a more efficient clearing of intracellular parasite infection.--NEW SECTION--This study demonstrates that the high-density display of CSP on SpyTag-VLPs, significantly increases the level and quality of the vaccine-induced humoral response, compared to a control vaccine consisting of soluble CSP plus AP205 VLPs. The SpyTag-VLP platform utilized in this study constitutes a versatile and rapid method to develop highly immunogenic vaccines.

Recent studies have shown that Afghans with mental illness are not only deprived of care but are vulnerable in many other ways. Innovative participatory approaches to the design of mental healthcare policies and programs are needed in such challenging context.--NEW SECTION--We employed community based system dynamics to examine interactions between multiple factors and actors to examine the problem of persistently low service utilization for people with mental illness. Group model building sessions, designed based on a series of scripts and led by three facilitators, took place with NGO staff members in Mazar-I-Sharif in July 2014 and in Kabul in February 2015.--NEW SECTION--We identified major feedback loops that constitute a hypothesis of how system components interact to generate a persistently low rate of service utilization by people with mental illness. In particular, we found that the interaction of the combined burdens of poverty and cost of treatment interact with cultural and social stigmatizing beliefs, in the context of limited clinical or other treatment support, to perpetuate low access to care for people with mental disorders. These findings indicate that the introduction of mental healthcare services alone will not be sufficient to meaningfully improve the condition of individuals with mental illness if community stigma and poverty are not addressed concurrently.--NEW SECTION--Our model highlights important factors that prevent persons with mental illness from accessing services. Our study demonstrates that group model building methods using community based system dynamics can provide an effective tool to elicit a common vision on a complex problem and identify shared potential strategies for intervention in a development and global health context. Its strength and originality is the leadership role played by the actors embedded within the system in describing the complex problem and suggesting interventions.",eng,Conflict and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Thus, eradication of this disease will strongly require better therapeutic strategies. Identification of host factors promoting disease progression may accelerate discovery of adjunct host-directed therapies (HDTs) that will boost current treatment protocols. HDTs focus on potentiating key components of host anti-mycobacterial effector mechanisms, and limiting inflammation and pathological damage in the lung. Granulomas represent a pathological hallmark of TB. They are comprised of impressive arrangement of immune cells that serve to contain the invading pathogen. However, granulomas can also undergo changes, developing caseums and cavities that facilitate bacterial spread and disease progression. Here, we review current concepts on the role of granulomas in pathogenesis and protective immunity against TB, drawing from recent clinical studies in humans and animal models.

NO2 exposure resulted in a concentration-dependent release of IL-6, but not IL-8 release. The coexposure of 0.1 ppm NO2 and Der p 1, or 1 ppm NO2 and Der p 1 significantly increased both IL-6 and IL-8 release. Exposure to NO2, Der p 1, or their combination, did not significantly influence the production of IL-6 or IL-8 mRNA. In conclusion, NO2 increases the release of inflammatory cytokines in human nasal epithelial cells, especially in coexposure with Der p 1, as a mechanism of allergotoxicology.",eng,International archives of allergy and immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Diarrheal diseases and dengue fever are major global health problems sharing common risk factors in water storage containers. Where provision of clean water is inadequate, water storage is crucial. Fecal contamination of stored water is a common source of diarrheal illness, but stored water also provides breeding sites for dengue vector mosquitoes. Integrating improved water management and educational strategies for both diseases in the school environment can potentially improve the health situation for students and the larger community. The objective of this trial was to investigate whether interventions targeting diarrhea and dengue risk factors would significantly reduce absence due to diarrheal disease and dengue entomological risk factors in schools.--NEW SECTION--A factorial cluster randomized controlled trial was carried out in 34 rural primary schools (1,301 pupils) in La Mesa and Anapoima municipalities, Cundinamarca, Colombia. Schools were randomized to one of four study arms: diarrhea interventions (DIA), dengue interventions (DEN), combined diarrhea and dengue interventions (DIADEN), and control (CON). Interventions had no apparent effect on pupil school absence due to diarrheal disease (p = 0.45) or on adult female Aedes aegypti density (p = 0.32) (primary outcomes). However, the dengue interventions reduced the Breteau Index on average by 78% (p = 0.029), with Breteau indices of 10.8 and 6.2 in the DEN and DIADEN arms, respectively compared to 37.5 and 46.9 in the DIA and CON arms, respectively. The diarrhea interventions improved water quality as assessed by the amount of Escherichia coli colony forming units (CFU); the ratio of Williams mean E. coli CFU being 0.22, or 78% reduction (p = 0.008).--NEW SECTION--Integrated control of dengue and diarrhea has never been conducted before. This trial presents an example for application of control strategies that may affect both diseases and the first study to apply such an approach in school settings. The interventions were well received and highly appreciated by students and teachers. An apparent absence of effect in primary outcome indicators could be the result of pupils being exposed to risk factors outside the school area and mosquitoes flying in from nearby uncontrolled breeding sites. Integrated interventions targeting these diseases in a school context remain promising because of the reduced mosquito breeding and improved water quality, as well as educational benefits. However, to improve outcomes in future integrated approaches, simultaneous interventions in communities, in addition to schools, should be considered; using appropriate combinations of site-specific, effective, acceptable, and affordable interventions.--NEW SECTION--ClinicalTrials.gov no.

Epidemiologic data and recent genetic insights provide compelling evidence that triglycerides are in the causal pathway for the development of atherosclerosis, thereby renewing interest in targeting triglycerides to improve ASCVD outcomes. Fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids (OM3FAs) are three classes of triglyceride-lowering drugs. Outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering agents have been inconsistent. With regard to OM3FAs, the JELIS study showed that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly reduced major coronary events in statin-treated hypercholesterolemic patients. Regarding other agents, extended-release niacin and fenofibrate are no longer recommended as statin add-on therapy (by some guidelines, though not all) because of the lack of convincing evidence from outcome studies. Notably, subgroup analyses from the outcome studies have generated the hypothesis that triglyceride lowering may provide benefit in statin-treated patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. Two ongoing OM3FA outcome studies (REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH) are testing this hypothesis in high-risk, statin-treated patients with triglyceride levels of 200 to 500 mg/dL.--NEW SECTION--There is consistent evidence that triglycerides are in the causal pathway of atherosclerosis but inconsistent evidence from cardiovascular outcomes studies as to whether triglyceride-lowering agents reduce cardiovascular risk. Ongoing outcomes studies will determine the role of triglyceride lowering in statin-treated patients with high-dose prescription OM3FAs in terms of improved ASCVD outcomes.--NEW SECTION--AACE = American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists ACCORD = Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes AIM-HIGH = Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes apo = apolipoprotein ASCEND = A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease BIP = Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention CHD = coronary heart disease CI = confidence interval CV = cardiovascular CVD = cardiovascular disease DHA = docosahexaenoic acid DO-IT = Diet and Omega-3 Intervention Trial EPA = eicosapentaenoic acid FIELD = Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes GISSI-HF = GISSI-Heart Failure HDL-C = high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol HPS2-THRIVE = Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events HR = hazard ratio JELIS = Japan Eicosapentaenoic Acid Lipid Intervention Study LDL = low-density lipoprotein LDL-C = low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol MI = myocardial infarction OM3FAs = omega-3 fatty acids VITAL = Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial.",eng,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

With the growth of multi-jurisdictional and multicultural global health partnerships, the adequacy of the prevailing bioethical paradigm guiding the conduct of global health research and practice is being increasingly challenged. In response to ethical challenges and conflicts confronted by decision-makers in global health research and practice, we propose an innovative methodology that could be developed to bridge the gap between polarized systems of ideas and values (metaphysical, epistemological, moral, and political).

This presents a significant health care burden with respect to maternal morbidities and offspring complications at birth and in later life. In recent years it has also become clear that maternal obesity is an even greater global health problem than anticipated, because the effects are not limited to the mother but are also programmed in the fetus, known as the 'intergenerational cycle of obestiy'. Despite a large body of epidemiological evidence reporting outcomes of obese pregnancies, including offspring respiratory complications, much less is known about the molecular effects of maternal obesity on fetal lung development. This review focuses on the influence of altered substrate supply associated with the obesogenic intrauterine environment on fetal lung development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms contributing to altered fetal lung development will lead to improved respiratory outcomes for offspring at birth and in later life.",eng,Paediatric respiratory reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

This study aimed to investigate the effects of rice rhizosphere oxic conditions on silicate transporter (responsible for arsenite transportation) expressions, and on As accumulation and speciation in four rice genotypes, including two hybrid genotypes (Xiangfengyou9, Shenyou9586) and two indica subspecies (Xiangwanxian17, Xiangwanxian12). Oxic and anoxic treatments have different effects on root length (p < 0.001) and weight (p < 0.05). Total As concentrations in roots were dramatically lower in oxic treatments (88.8-218 mg/kg), compared to anoxic treatments (147-243 mg/kg) (p < 0.001). Moreover, root and shoot arsenite concentrations in oxic treatments were lower than that in anoxic treatments in arsenite treatments. The relative abundance of silicate transporter expressions displayed a trend of down-regulation in oxic treatments compared to anoxic treatments, especially significantly different for Xiangwanxian17, Xiangwanxian12 in Lsi1 expressions (p < 0.05), Xiangfengyou9, Shenyou9586, Xiangwanxian17 in Lsi2 expressions (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences of transporter expressions in different As treatments and genotypes.

Considering that atherosclerosis has autoimmune and inflammatory components, immunotherapy is a possible focus to treat this disease. Areas covered: Based on the analysis of the current biomedical literature, this review describes the status on the development of vaccines against atherosclerosis. Several targets have been identified including sequences of apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), heat shock proteins (HSP), extracellular matrix proteins, T cell receptor β chain variable region 31 (TRBV31), the major outer membrane protein (MOMP), and the outer membrane protein 5 (Pomp5) from Chlamydia pneumoniae.

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 18071 trial demonstrated a 28% reduction in risk of death in patients treated with ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg (hazard ratio for death, 0.72; 95.1% CI, 0.58-0.88; P = 0.001) compared with placebo. All end-points-recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant-metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS)-showed similar benefits. Survival rates at 5 years in ipilimumab-treated patients were OS 11%, DMFS 9% and RFS 11% higher than in placebo-treated patients. Global Health quality-of-life scores were not significantly different between treatment arms, in spite of significant adverse event rates that resulted in only 42% of patients receiving more than four doses of ipilimumab and only 28.9% of patients going beyond 1 year of treatment. Grades 3-4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 41.6% of ipilimumab-treated patients and in 2.7% of placebo-treated patients. One can speculate on dose and duration of treatment, as well as on the requirement for complete lymph-node dissection in sentinel-node-positive patients. The remaining role of interferons will be discussed regarding differences in sensitivity profiles-such as in ulcerated melanoma versus non-ulcerated melanoma-and access to new drugs. Ongoing trials with targeted agents and with anti programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) agents may bring significant additional results in the next few years that will redefine how we treat stage III patients.

Patients were classified into schizophrenia (n=70) and mood disorders (n=26) by psychiatric diagnoses with DSM-IV-TR criteria.--NEW SECTION--The incidence of brain damage [symptomatic and silent brain infarctions (SBIs) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH)] was correlated more with mood disorders than with schizophrenia. It has been previously shown that the concentrations of protein-conjugated acrolein (PC-Acro) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased in plasma of brain infarction patients together with C-reactive protein (CRP). The concentration of PC-Acro was significantly higher in patients with mood disorders than in those with schizophrenia. The concentration of IL-6 in both groups was nearly equal to that in the control group, but that of CRP in both groups, especially in mood disorders, was higher than that in the control group. Accordingly, the relative risk value for brain infarction was higher in patients with mood disorders than with schizophrenia. Medication with atypical antipsychotics reduced PC-Acro significantly in all psychiatric patients and reduced IL-6 in mood disorder patients.--NEW SECTION--Measurement of 3 biomarkers (CRP, PC-Acro and IL-6) are probably useful for judgement of severity of brain damage and effectiveness of medication in psychiatric patients.",eng,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

We bridge this gap using data from a large and long-standing HIV-1 prospective cohort, in Uganda. We use an epidemiological-evolutionary model parameterised with this data to derive evolutionary predictions based on analysis and detailed individual-based simulations. We robustly predict stabilising selection towards a low level of virulence, and rapid attenuation of the virus. Accordingly, set-point viral load, the most common measure of virulence, has declined in the last 20 years. Our model also predicts that subtype A is slowly outcompeting subtype D, with both subtypes becoming less virulent, as observed in the data. Reduction of set-point viral loads should have resulted in a 20% reduction in incidence, and a three years extension of untreated asymptomatic infection, increasing opportunities for timely treatment of infected individuals.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

CSR policy has focused on shaping corporate policies and practices related to the environment, labor, and human rights, but has also ignored the health needs of women workers. The authors present a new way for global health to understand CSR - as a set of regulatory processes governed by civil society, international institutions, business, and government that set, monitor, and enforce emerging standards related to the role of business in society. They call this the CSR system. They argue that the global health community needs to think differently about the role of corporations in public health, which has been as ""partners,"" and that the global health practitioners should play the same advocacy role in the CSR system for corporate health policies as it does for government and international health policies.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Therefore, identifying novel prophylactic or therapeutic treatments that induce appropriate innate immune responses to protect against influenza infection would represent an important advance in efforts to limit the impact of influenza. Cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize conserved structures expressed by pathogens to trigger intracellular signaling cascades, promoting expression of proinflammatory molecules and innate immunity. Therefore, a number of approaches have been developed to target specific PRRs in an effort to stimulate innate immunity and reduce disease in a variety of settings, including during influenza infections. Herein, we discuss progress in immunomodulation strategies designed to target cell-associated PRRs of the innate immune system, thereby, modifying innate responses to IAV infection and/or augmenting immune responses to influenza vaccines.",eng,Journal of leukocyte biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

A wide variety of natural products in plants and other marine animals represent antioxidant activity and other health benefits like those of sea cucumber. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the antidiabetic activity of glycosidic compound - saponin - derived from the Egyptian sea cucumber, Holothuria thomasi.--NEW SECTION--Saponin has been extracted from the Egyptian sea cucumber and confirmed by hemolysis, Salkowski tests, FT/IR, UV and GC-MS analysis. Eighty white female albino rats were divided into four equal groups. The first two groups of rats; control normal and control normal saponin-treated groups. The last two groups which were made diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin had one diabetic control and the other diabetic group that got 300mg/kg B.wt. of saponin extract after Thirty-five days after diabetes induction and lasted for six weeks.--NEW SECTION--The functional group of saponin extract which established with FT/IR spectroscopy demonstrated the presence of saponin in the extracted materials as shown in the peak of the functional group in relevance to the standard one. The UV spectra revealed that λmax of saponin extract was 282nm which in accordance to the standard saponin. Also, GC-MS analysis indicated that the aglycone part of saponin was methyl esters of octadecanoic acid. Saponin extract significantly decreased serum glucose, α-amylase activity, adiponectin, IL-6, TNF-α concentrations and liver L-MDA. However, serum insulin and liver glycogen levels were significantly increased as compared with the diabetic non-treated groups. The histopathological results supported that saponin extract markedly reduced the degenerative change in β-cells.--NEW SECTION--This study, therefore, depicts that the Egyptian Holothuria thomasi, sea cucumber saponin as a hypoglycemic agent with the potential to normalize aberrant biochemical parameters and preserved the normal histological architecture of the islets cells of pancreatic tissues.",eng,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Since the 1930s, prevention of stroke and pulmonary embolism in these patients has been achieved using conventional anticoagulants, such as heparin and warfarin. However, in recent years, four direct non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have entered the market as alternative treatment options. Betrixaban is a fifth DOAC looking to gain marketing approval in the near future, and may have several potentially beneficial properties. Areas covered: Here, we outline the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of betrixaban, and summarise its clinical efficacy and safety based on the results of phase II/III trials. Expert commentary: Betrixaban has been demonstrated to have antithrombotic activity that may make it a valuable addition to the repertoire of DOACs currently available. The low renal clearance and minimal hepatic metabolism of the drug may make it particularly beneficial for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction. The lack of an effective reversal agent may be a more significant issue for betrixaban compared with the already approved DOACs as it has a longer terminal half-life. Available data suggest that continued development of betrixaban is justified; however, further large randomised clinical trials are essential in order to clarify its efficacy and safety.",eng,Expert review of hematology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The cardiovascular benefits of reversing obesity in adults are well-established. Compared with other weight-loss strategies, programmes that incorporate bariatric surgery for weight loss are beneficial for sustained BMI reduction. A marked improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, inflammation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been observed after bariatric surgery. This broad improvement in cardiovascular risk profile has led to substantial reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. As with all procedures, the benefits of bariatric surgery must be weighed against its potential risks. Modern bariatric surgery has an excellent safety profile, but important limitations remain, including the potential for surgical complications and nutritional deficiencies, and the lifelong requirement for nutritional supplementation. Surgery should be considered in patients with severe obesity, especially those with cardiovascular comorbidities. In this Review, we summarize the current management options for patients with obesity, and discuss the effects of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes.",eng,Nature reviews.

In this review, we describe an overview of tobacco control interventions that have led to substantial declines in tobacco use and the relationship between these declines with CVH and CVD. We review interventions that have had success in high-income countries (HICs) as well as those that are gaining traction in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We emphasize the challenges to comprehensive tobacco prevention and control strategies faced by LMICs, and highlight the special role of cardiovascular health professionals in achieving CVH promotion and CVD prevention endpoints through tobacco control. Tobacco prevention and control strategies have a strong scientific basis, yet a distinct gap remains between this evidence and implementation of tobacco control policies, particularly in LMICs. Health professionals can contribute to tobacco control efforts, especially through patient-level clinical interventions, when supported by a health care system and government that recognize and support tobacco control as a critical strategy for CVH promotion and CVD prevention. Understanding, supporting, and applying current and evolving policies, programs, and practices in tobacco prevention and control is the province of all health professionals, especially those concerned with CVH promotion and CVD prevention.

We assessed the extent of compliance with 14 countries' HWL requirements. Unique cigarette packs were purchased in 2013 using a systematic protocol in 12 distinct neighborhoods within three of the ten most populous cities in the 14 low- and middle-income countries with the greatest number (count) of smokers. HWL compliance codebooks were developed for each country based on the details of country-specific HWL requirements, with up to four common compliance indicators assessed for each country (location, size, label elements, text size). Packs (n=1859) were double coded for compliance. Compliance was examined by country and pack characteristics, including parent company and brand family. Overall, 72% of coded cigarette packs were compliant with all relevant compliance indicators, ranging from 17% in the Philippines to 94% in Mexico. Compliance was highest for location of the warning (ranging from 75%-100%) and lowest for warning size (ranging from 46%-99%). Compliance was higher for packs bought in high SES neighborhoods, and varied by parent company and brand family. This multi-country study found at least one pack in every country - and many packs in some countries - that were not compliant with key requirements for health warning labels in the country of purchase. Non-compliance may be exacerbating health disparities. Tobacco companies should be held accountable for complying with country HWL requirements.",eng,Preventive medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

It is also a recognised problem in veterinary medicine. Between September and December 2015 the authors administered a cross-sectional survey to licensed veterinarians in Washington State to assess factors affecting antimicrobial prescribing practices among veterinarians in Washington State. Two hundred and three veterinarians completed the survey. The majority of respondents (166, 82 per cent) were engaged in small animal or exotic animal practice. 24 per cent of respondents reported not ordering culture and sensitivity (C/S) testing in practice. Of the 76 per cent of veterinarians who reported ordering C/S tests, 36 per cent reported ordering such testing 'often' or 'always' when treating presumptive bacterial infections. Most respondents (65 per cent) mentioned cost as the most common barrier to ordering a C/S test. Only 16 (10 per cent) respondents reported having access to or utilising a clinic-specific antibiogram. This survey demonstrated that while antimicrobials are commonly used in veterinary practice, and veterinarians are concerned about antimicrobial resistance, cost is a barrier to obtaining C/S tests to guide antimicrobial therapy. Summaries of antimicrobial resistance patterns are rarely available to the practising veterinarian. Efforts to promote antimicrobial stewardship in a 'One Health' manner should address barriers to the judicious use of antimicrobials in the veterinary practice setting.",eng,The Veterinary record,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

It is still a global-health threat, particularly because of the drug-resistant forms. Fluoroquinolones, with target of gyrase, are among the drugs used to treat tuberculosis. However, their widespread use has led to bacterial resistance. The molecular mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in mycobacterium tuberculosis have been reported, such as DNA gyrase mutations, drug efflux pumps system, bacterial cell wall thickness and pentapeptide proteins (MfpA) mediated regulation of gyrase. Mutations in gyrase conferring quinolone resistance play important roles and have been extensively studied. Recent studies have shown that the regulation of DNA gyrase affects mycobacterial drug resistance, but the mechanisms, especially by post-translational modification and regulatory proteins, are poorly understood. In this review, we summarize the fluoroquinolone drug development, and the molecular genetics of fluoroquinolone resistance in mycobacteria. Comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis will open a new view on understanding drug resistance in mycobacteria and lead to novel strategies to develop new accurate diagnosis methods.",eng,Yi chuan = Hereditas,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in developing electronic approaches to addressing this problem, with mobile technology at the forefront of these efforts. We investigate the possibility of biometrics as a simple, cost-efficient, and portable solution. Common biometrics approaches include fingerprinting, iris scanning and facial recognition, but all are less than ideal due to complexity, infringement on privacy, cost, or portability. Ear biometrics, however, proved to be a unique and viable solution.--NEW SECTION--We developed an identification algorithm then conducted a cross sectional study in which we photographed left and right ears from 25 consenting adults. We then conducted re-identification and statistical analyses to identify the accuracy and replicability of our approach.--NEW SECTION--Through principal component analysis, we found the curve of the ear helix to be the most reliable anatomical structure and the basis for re-identification. Although an individual ear allowed for high re-identification rate (88.3%), when both left and right ears were paired together, our rate of re-identification amidst the pool of potential matches was 100%.--NEW SECTION--The results of this study have implications on future efforts towards building a biometrics solution for patient identification in LMICs.

It is recognized that robust AMR surveillance is necessary; however, current gaps in national surveillance programs need to be addressed to enable better evidence-informed program and policy decisions.--NEW SECTION--To describe how an AMR Surveillance Task Group prioritized national AMR surveillance data requirements for high priority AMR organisms for human health in Canada and made recommendations on addressing the current data gaps.--NEW SECTION--The 2015 AMR Surveillance Task Group examined the data requirements for previously identified first priority organisms and assessed whether the current system met, partially met or did not meet these requirements. Information was summarized into synopsis tables and a ranking process was used to prioritize the data requirements and develop specific recommendations to address the gaps.--NEW SECTION--First priority organisms identified for AMR surveillance are: Clostridium difficile, Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms, Carbapenem-resistant organisms (Acinetobacter + Enterobacteriaceae species), Enterococcus species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumonaea, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Campylobacter species. For these organisms, there were 19 high priority data requirements identified: 10 of these requirements were met by the current surveillance systems, seven were partially met and two were unmet. For the two high priority data metrics in the community setting, the Task Group recommended conducting a point-prevalence community-based study (i.e., every five years) to follow infection rates of C. difficile infection, and community level antibiogram data on an annual basis for susceptibility data for Enterobacteriaceae species (E. coli and Klebsiella) causing genito-urinary infections. There were eight medium priority data requirements identified: one requirement was met by the current surveillance system, five were partially met and two were unmet. The medium priority unmet data requirements included susceptibility of infection isolates for C. difficile (diarrheal disease) and infection rates for Enterobacteriaceae species causing genito-urinary tract infections in community settings. It was noted that the feasibility of obtaining this medium priority in data in the community setting was low. The Task Group identified bloodstream infections as the top priority site of infection for AMR surveillance in the health care setting given the high morbidity and mortality associated with bloodstream infections. The importance of collecting susceptibility data on N. gonorrhoeae in the community was underscored given the rise in resistance and that the current surveillance system only partially collects this data. The Task Group recommended that a review of the national AMR surveillance data requirement priorities should occur on an ongoing basis and when new issues emerge.--NEW SECTION--While current national surveillance programs either capture or partially capture many of the identified data requirements for first priority organisms, several gaps still remain, especially in community settings.

The case of antimicrobial resistance.,"On September 21, 2016, the United Nations General Assembly held a high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Participating political leaders committed to coordinate action across the human and animal health, agriculture and environmental sectors and to work at national, regional and international levels with the public sector, private sector, civil society and all other relevant actors, including the public. The objective of this article is to outline how the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has been working to address AMR in Canada. PHAC has used a One Health approach and has been working at the federal level with other government departments and nationally with the provinces, territories, professional organizations and other key players to address AMR. To date, the federal response has focused on surveillance, stewardship and innovation across multiple sectors, including human health, animal health, regulatory actions and research. PHAC is currently working with the provinces and territories as well as key experts in the field to develop a pan-Canadian AMR Framework and subsequent action plan that will outline best practices and approaches to AMR across human and animal health. The Framework will build on previous work done by PHAC and the federal/provincial/territorial Pan-Canadian Public Health Network Council, and recognizes the research expertise in Canada, the need to ensure actions are based on evidence, and to combat AMR through infection prevention and control. The three articles in this issue are examples of the foundational work that has been done federally by PHAC, in developing the Canadian AMR Surveillance System (CARSS), and nationally, through task groups of the Public Health Network Council, in identifying where to strengthen human surveillance of AMR and best practices for stewardship in the human health care system.

The country also experiences significant gaps in quality cervical cancer screening coverage for the population.--NEW SECTION--This descriptive mixed methods study conducted in Cusco, Peru, aimed to assess the attitudes and perceptions of medical staff, health care workers, and patients toward a cervical cancer screening program that included both clinic-based and community outreach services conducted by a nongovernmental organization clinic (CerviCusco). The study also explored patient knowledge and attitudes around cervical cancer and about the human papillomavirus (HPV) to inform patient education efforts.--NEW SECTION--The study employed structured interviews with key informants (n=16) primarily from CerviCusco, which provides cervical cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment services, and surveys with a sample of patients (n=30) receiving services at the clinic and at screening campaigns.--NEW SECTION--The majority of key informant medical staff participants felt that the general public had a very negative view of government health services. One theme running throughout the interviews was the perception that the general population lacked a culture of preventive health care and would wait until symptoms were severe before seeking treatment. Regarding services that were received by patients at CerviCusco, the participants responded that the prices were reasonable and more affordable than some private clinics. Patients attending the rural health campaigns liked that the services were free and of good quality.--NEW SECTION--CerviCusco has demonstrated its capacity to provide screening outreach campaigns to populations who had not previously had access to liquid-based cytology services. The finding that patients had generally low levels of knowledge about cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine prompted the development of culturally and linguistically appropriate educational and promotional materials to improve the educational component of the periodic campaigns conducted primarily in rural areas of Andean Peru.",eng,Patient preference and adherence,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27799289,10.1093/inthealth/ihw043,Challenges and strategies for implementing mental health measurement for research in low-resource settings.,"The gap between need and access to mental health care is widest in low-resource settings. Health systems in these contexts devote few resources to expanding mental health care, and it is missing from the agenda of most global health donors. This is partially explained by the paucity of data regarding the nature and extent of the mental health burden in these settings, so accurate and comparable measurement is essential to advocating for, developing, and implementing appropriate policies and services. Inaccurate estimation of mental illness prevalence, and misunderstandings regarding its etiologies and expressions, are associated with unnecessary costs to health systems and people living with mental illness. This paper presents a selective literature review of the challenges associated with mental health measurement in these settings globally, presents several case studies, and suggests three strategies for researchers to improve their assessments: utilize qualitative data, conduct cognitive interviews and train research teams with a focus on inter-rater reliability. These three strategies presented, added to the complement of tools used by mental health researchers in low-resource settings, will enable more researchers to conduct culturally valid work, improve the quality of data available, and assist in narrowing the treatment gap.",eng,International health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Significant health disparities exist for the treatment of hydrocephalus in developing nations due to a combination of medical, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. This review aims to provide the international neurosurgery community with an overview of the current challenges and future directions of neurosurgical care for children with hydrocephalus in low-income countries. METHODS The authors conducted a literature review around the topic of pediatric hydrocephalus in the context of global surgery, the unique challenges to creating access to care in low-income countries, and current international efforts to address the problem. RESULTS Developing countries face the greatest burden of pediatric hydrocephalus due to high birth rates and greater risk of neonatal infections. This burden is related to more general global health challenges, including malnutrition, infectious diseases, maternal and perinatal risk factors, and education gaps. Unique challenges pertaining to the treatment of hydrocephalus in the developing world include a preponderance of postinfectious hydrocephalus, limited resources, and restricted access to neurosurgical care. In the 21st century, several organizations have established programs that provide hydrocephalus treatment and neurosurgical training in Africa, Central and South America, Haiti, and Southeast Asia. These international efforts have employed various models to achieve the goals of providing safe, sustainable, and cost-effective treatment. CONCLUSIONS Broader commitment from the pediatric neurosurgery community, increased funding, public education, surgeon training, and ongoing surgical innovation will be needed to meaningfully address the global burden of untreated hydrocephalus.",eng,Neurosurgical focus,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Steadily increasing numbers of drugs appeared to be required to achieve even modest control. Early type 2 diabetes has now been shown to be reversed by substantial weight loss and this has allowed temporal tracking of the underlying pathophysiological changes. Areas covered: In early type 2 diabetes, negative calorie balance decreases liver fat within days, and allows return of normal control of hepatic glucose production. Over 8 weeks, the negative calorie balance allows the raised levels of intra-pancreatic fat and simultaneously first phase insulin secretion to normalise. These findings are consistent with the 2008 Twin Cycle Hypothesis of the etiology and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Individuals develop type 2 diabetes when they exceed their personal fat threshold for safe storage of fat and there is no difference in pathophysiology between those with BMI above or below 30 kg/m2.

Macular focal and/or grid laser photocoagulation applied to microaneurysms and thickened retina had long been primary therapy for diabetic macular edema. Chronically elevated serum glucose is known to cause breakdown in the inner and outer retinal blood barrier resulting in upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, including ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept, have been shown in randomized clinical trials to be superior to macular laser for the treatment of clinically relevant diabetic macular edema. The READ-2, RISE/RIDE, and RESTORE trials established ranibizumab's superiority to macular laser, whereas the BOLT trial demonstrated bevacizumab's superiority to laser. The DRCR.net Protocol T results showed that intravitreal aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab were all effective in reducing retinal thickness secondary to diabetic edema and in improving vision. When the presenting vision was 20/40 or better, visual improvement was equivalent. With eyes presenting with 20/50 or worse vision, aflibercept was superior with respect to visual improvement.

Changes in diet around the world mean that populations are now increasingly reliant on highly processed, poor quality foods, which have been linked to increased risk for mental disorder. Conversely, a nutrient-rich diet is understood to be protective of mental health, and researchers are now aiming to understand the biological underpinnings of this relationship. The gut microbiota has been proposed as a key mediator of this link, given its association with both diet and mental health. Importantly, several critical ""windows of opportunity"" for prevention and intervention have been identified, particularly early life and adolescence; these are periods of rapid development and transition that provide a foundation for future health. Strategies that promote overall diet quality, high in fiber and nutrients, have been linked to increased microbial diversity and gut health.

Patient global assessment (PGA) is one of the most widely used PROs in RA practice and research and is included in several composite scores such as the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28). PGA is often assessed by a single question with a 0-10 or 0-100 response. The content can vary and relates either to global health (e.g., how is your health overall) or to disease activity (e.g., how active is your arthritis). The wordings used as anchors, i.e., for the score of 0, 10, or 100 according to the scale used, and the timing (i.e., this day or this week) also vary. The different possible ways of measuring PGA translate into variations in its interpretation and reporting and may impact on measures of disease activity and consequently achievement of treat-to-target goals. Furthermore, although PGA is associated with objective measures of disease activity, it is also associated with other aspects of health, such as psychological distress or comorbidities, which leads to situations of discordance between objective RA assessments and PGA. Focusing on the role of PGA, its use and interpretation in RA, this review explores its validity and correlations with other disease measures and its overall value for research and routine clinical practice.",eng,Arthritis research & therapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Herein, we analyzed the peripheral blood of a unique cohort of Malawian children with severe malaria, and performed a comprehensive overview of blood leukocytes and inflammatory mediators present in these patients. We reveal robust immune cell activation, notably of CD14+ inflammatory monocytes, NK cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) that is associated with very high inflammation. Using the Plasmodium yoelii 17X YM surrogate mouse model of lethal malaria, we report a comparable pattern of immune cell activation and inflammation and found that type I IFN represents a key checkpoint for disease outcomes. Compared to wild type mice, mice lacking the type I interferon (IFN) receptor exhibited a significant decrease in immune cell activation and inflammatory response, ultimately surviving the infection. We demonstrate that pDCs were the major producers of systemic type I IFN in the bone marrow and the blood of infected mice, via TLR7/MyD88-mediated recognition of Plasmodium parasites. This robust type I IFN production required priming of pDCs by CD169+ macrophages undergoing activation upon STING-mediated sensing of parasites in the bone marrow. pDCs and macrophages displayed prolonged interactions in this compartment in infected mice as visualized by intravital microscopy. Altogether our findings describe a novel mechanism of pDC activation in vivo and precise stepwise cell/cell interactions taking place during severe malaria that contribute to immune cell activation and inflammation, and subsequent disease outcomes.",eng,PLoS pathogens,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and blood glucose (GLU) were significantly lowered in Pic-treated groups. Pic significantly decreased the weight of liver, spleen, perigonadal and retroperitoneal fat compared with the HFD group. Pic significantly reduced the adipocyte cell size of perigonadal fat and decreased the weight of liver. Pic-treated mice showed higher phosphorylated adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) and phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (pACC) protein levels and decreased protein levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein C/EBPα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARγ and fatty acid synthase (FAS), resulting in decreased lipid accumulation in adipocytes and the liver.

The mean (±SD) vitamin D levels were 19.00ng/ml (±16.50), 14.10ng/ml (±11.10) and 13.20ng/ml (±8.80) in patients with CAD with 50%-70%, >70%-90% and >90% stenosis respectively (p= 0.46) and 15.20ng/ml (±13.00), 15.50ng/ml (±11.30) and 11.80ng/ml (±7.00) in patients with CAD with single, double and triple vessels disease respectively (p= 0.14). The frequency of vitamin D deficiency were 66.70%, 83.20 % and 83.10% in patients with CAD with 50% -70%, >70%-90% and >90% stenosis respectively and 81.40%, 80.00% and 83.50% in patients with single, double and triple vessel disease respectively, as compared to 89.30% in patients with normal coronary artery (p= 0.41 and 0.075). So, all the study groups of CAD had low serum vitamin D level and high frequency of vitamin D deficiency, which was statistically insignificant.--NEW SECTION--Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is very high in CAD, but it does not correlate with the angiographic severity of CAD.",eng,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The aim of this study was to determine hematological and biochemical changes and associated risk factors in smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients undergoing treatment with standard protocols.--NEW SECTION--In a descriptive study, a total of 40 tuberculosis patients aged between 15-60 years were collected from hospitals in Khuzestan Province (Iran) from March 2013 to March 2014. The patients were treated with drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) during the initial two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for the next four to six months. Activities of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP) and hematological parameters were recorded before and after treatment. Data were analyzed using paired samples t-test and Wilcoxon test by SPSS 16.--NEW SECTION--After using drug treatments, hematological parameters (RBC, Hb, HCT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC), except platelet count, were changed significantly (p ≤ 0.001). Liver enzyme activities (ALT, AST, and ALP) were decreased significantly (p ≤ 0.001) after treatment.--NEW SECTION--In this study, changes of hematological and biochemical parameters have been observed in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

27686961,10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.09.021,Role of placental barrier integrity in infection by Trypanosoma cruzi.,"American trypanosomiasis has long been a neglected disease endemic in LatinAmerica, but congenital transmission has now spread Chagas disease to cause a global health problem. As the early stages of the infection of placental tissue and the vertical transmission by Trypanosoma cruzi are still not well understood, it is important to investigate the relevance of the first structure of the placental barrier in chorionic villi infection by T. cruzi during the initial stage of the infection. Explants of human chorionic villi from healthy pregnant women at term were denuded of their syncytiotrophoblast and co-cultured for 3h, 24h and 96h with 800,000 trypomastigotes (simulating acute infection). T. cruzi infected cells were identified by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin-7 (+cytotrophoblast) and CD68 (+macrophages), and the infection was quantified. In placental tissue, the parasite load was analyzed by qPCR and microscopy, and the motile trypomastigotes were quantified in culture supernatant. In denuded chorionic villous, the total area occupied by the parasite (451.23μm2, 1.33%) and parasite load (RQ: 87) was significantly higher (p<0.05) than in the entire villous (control) (5.98μm2, 0.016%) (RQ:1) and with smaller concentration of nitric oxide. Stromal non-macrophage cells were infected as well as cytotrophoblasts and some macrophages, but with significant differences being observed. The parasite quantity in the culture supernatant was significantly higher (p<0.05) in denuded culture explants from 96h of culture. Although the human complete chorionic villi limited the infection, the detachment of the first structure of the placenta barrier (syncytiotrophoblast) increased both the infection of the villous stroma and the living trypomastigotes in the culture supernatant. Therefore structural and functional alterations to chorionic villi placental barrier reduce placental defenses and may contribute to the vertical transmission of Chagas.",eng,Acta tropica,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We assessed neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses of volunteers in a phase 1 study of a CHIKV vaccine against 9 viral strains representing all 3 genotypes.

This meta-analysis investigated whether three HLOC dimensions (internality/I-HLOC, powerful others/P-HLOC, chance/C-HLOC) were related to both specific health behaviours and global health appraisal, and whether these relationships were moderated by gender and age compositions, individualism, and power distance. Three-level mixed-effects meta-analysis was performed on studies examining the associations of HLOC with specific health behaviour (k = 76, N = 76,580, 57% women, Mage = 43.75) and global health appraisal (k = 95, N = 12,068, 57% women, Mage = 45.44), respectively. For specific health behaviour, the averaged correlations with the HLOC dimensions were generally weak (r's = -.07 to .10). However, the links between P-HLOC and exercise were moderated by all four demographic moderators, and gender composition and individualism moderated the association between the HLOC dimensions and diet. For global health appraisal, all of the averaged correlations were statistically significant (r's = -.16 to .21), except that between P-HLOC and mental quality of life. The results further showed individualism and power distance to moderate the links between the HLOC dimensions and both mental and physical quality of life, and gender composition to moderate those between these dimensions and two indicators of emotional problems (depression and anxiety).",eng,Health psychology review,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Nevertheless, we found cases involve significant resource costs for governments, often progressing across multiple jurisdictional levels.--NEW SECTION--We suggest that, in light of our results, while litigation takes up significant time and incurs legal costs for health ministries, policymakers must robustly fend off suggestions that litigation wastes taxpayers' money, pointing to the good prospects of winning such legal battles.",eng,"Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27787949,10.1111/jnc.13880,Pasireotide prevents nuclear factor of activated T cells nuclear translocation and acts as a protective agent in aminoglycoside-induced auditory hair cell loss.,"Hearing impairment is a global health problem with a high socioeconomic impact. Damage to auditory hair cells (HCs) in the inner ear as a result of aging, disease, trauma, or toxicity, underlies the majority of cases of sensorineural hearing loss. Previously we demonstrated that the Ca2+ -sensitive neuropeptide, somatostatin (SST), and an analog, octreotide, protect HCs from gentamicin-induced cell death in vitro. Aminoglycosides such as gentamicin trigger a calcium ion influx (Ca2+ ) that activates pro-apoptotic signaling cascades in HCs. SST binding to the G-protein-coupled receptors (SSTR1-SSTR5) that are directly linked to voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels inhibits Ca2+ channel activity and associated downstream events. Here, we report that the SST analog pasireotide, a high affinity ligand to SSTRs 1-3, and 5, with a longer half-life than octreotide, prevents gentamicin-induced HC death in the mouse organ of Corti (OC). Explant experiments using OCs derived from SSTR1 and SSTR1and 2 knockout mice, revealed that SSTR2 mediates pasireotide's anti-apoptotic effects. Mechanistically, pasireotide prevented a nuclear translocation of the Ca2+ -sensitive transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which is ordinarily provoked by gentamicin in OC explants. Direct inhibition of NFAT with 11R-VIVIT also prevented the gentamicin-dependent nuclear translocation of NFAT and apoptosis. Both pasireotide and 11R-VIVIT partially reversed the effects of gentamicin on the expression of downstream survival targets (NMDA receptor and the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, PI3K). These data suggest that SST analogs antagonize aminoglycoside-induced cell death in an NFAT-dependent fashion. SST analogs and NFAT inhibitors may therefore offer new therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of hearing loss.",eng,Journal of neurochemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Patients with trauma between 2005 and 2007 that occurred 3 months before or after a diagnosis of abuse were identified from a randomly sampled nationwide longitudinal health insurance database of 1 million beneficiaries. The patients' demographic data, injury pattern, and medical resource utilization were measured, stratified by age and sex, and compared using chi-square test. Risk factors of next trauma event were identified using Cox regression analysis. Ninety-three patients (65 females) were identified (mean age, 20.6 ± 16.3 years), including 61.3% under 18 years of age. For the first trauma event, 68 patients (73.1%) visited the emergency room, 63 (67.7%) received intervention, and 14 (15.1%) needed hospital care. Seven (7.5%), all less than 11 years old, had intracranial hemorrhage and required intensive care. Thirty-three (35.5%) left with complications or sequelae, or required rehabilitation, but all survived. Of the 34 victims of sexual abuse, 32 were aged less than 18 years. Men received more mood stabilizers or antipsychotics (50.0% vs 10.7%, P = 0.030) and reeducative psychotherapy (25.0% vs 0, P = 0.044). Risk factors for a next trauma event were injury involving the extremities (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.27 [2.45-11.33]) and use of antibiotics (HR: 4.21 [1.45-12.24]) on the first trauma event.

It is also well known for generation of free radical and inducing apoptosis in different cell types. Paradoxically arsenic is reported to be a susceptible carcinogen as well. There are several reports demonstrating diverse mechanism of apoptosis in different cell types. However, the universal scenario of instrumental genes and their interaction leading to amplification of apoptotic signal are yet to be completely uncovered, which is predicted here. Conventional studies on signaling pathway aided by time and concentration kinetics data are inadequate for prediction of anchored genes for apoptotic signal amplification. Therefore, expression profile-based approach is adopted. Core apoptosis related and glutathione metabolism genes in 1 and 10 μM of arsenic-treated HepG2 cells were analyzed after 12 h of incubation. An arsenic treatment of 1 μM exhibits no cell death at 12 h, whereas 10 μM arsenic treatment reveals around 50% cell death at 12 h. Results depict 28 and 44 affected genes in 1 and 10 μM arsenic-treated cells, respectively. Early initiation of apoptotic signaling is detected in no cell death regimens (at 1 μM), whereas amplified apoptotic signal is demonstrated at 50% cell death regimens (at 10 μM). Instrumental genes involved in progression of apoptosis in the concourse of cell death and survival is designated from the responsive genes common to both the condition. We predict the initiation process is fairly aided by the activation of intrinsic pathway, which is amplified via TNF signaling and extrinsic pathway. Furthermore, regulatory genes involved in interplay between apoptosis/anti-apoptosis and their interactions are demonstrated here.",eng,Cell death discovery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Individuals with CSA histories are at risk for drug use, which is a growing problem in the Western Cape of South Africa. The present study of methamphetamine users in this region examined whether substance use coping, a contextually relevant type of avoidance-based coping, mediates the relation between CSA and depressive symptoms.--NEW SECTION--Participants included 161 men and 108 women seeking treatment for methamphetamine use. Participants completed a computer-assisted survey and a face-to-face interview with clinic staff to evaluate history of CSA, current substance use severity and coping, and current depressive symptoms.--NEW SECTION--Nearly a third of participants reported a history of CSA, and the average methamphetamine use severity score exceeded the threshold of high risk. A history of CSA was significantly associated with higher substance use coping and more depression symptoms. Substance use coping was a significant mediator of the association between CSA and depression symptoms.--NEW SECTION--In this study of high-risk methamphetamine users, substance use coping emerged as a common means of managing stress, especially for those with a history of CSA, which was further linked to depressive symptoms. These findings underscore the potential benefit of integrating coping interventions and mental health treatment into substance abuse treatment programs, particularly for those with a history of childhood abuse and violence.

Vector-borne diseases are prone to be impacted by global warming, although other factors may play a substantial role, evidenced by the dramatic decrease in malaria in the last decades in places where climate change has deep and significant effects. There is now evidence that in some areas of the world, e.g. Horn of Africa, warm El Niño Southern Oscillations (ENSO), which are observed in the South Pacific Ocean, are associated with higher risk of emergence of Rift Valley fever, cholera and malaria and during cold La Niña events, dengue fever, chikungunya and yellow fever. This has been observed for these and other diseases in other parts of the world. For example, seasonal influenza outbreaks have been more intense (i.e. higher number) and more severe (i.e. higher mortality) when concomitant with La Niña events.

In so doing, it would significantly strengthen accountability for the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which it would encompass. Legally binding, the FCGH could facilitate accountability through the courts and catalyze comprehensive domestic accountability regimes, requiring national strategies that include transparency, community and national mechanisms for accountability and participation and an enabling environment for social empowerment. A ""Right to Health Capacity Fund"" could ensure resources to implement these strategies. Inclusive national processes could establish targets, benchmarks, and indicators consistent with FCGH guidance, with regular reporting to a treaty body, which could also hear individual cases.

With more than 1.5 million deaths since 2000 attributed to strains of MDR-TB, and with half a million new, and mostly untreated, MDR-TB cases in the world each year, the stakes could not be higher. The World Health Organization (WHO), whose mandate is to champion the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health, recommended unsound medical treatment for MDR-TB patients in resource-poor settings from 1993-2002. Citing cost considerations, WHO did not recommend the available standard of care that had been successfully used to contain and defeat MDR-TB in rich countries. By acting as a strategic gatekeeper in its technical advisory role to donor agencies and countries, it also facilitated the global implementation of a double standard for TB care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), upending important legal and scientific priorities. This raises serious questions about whether the organization violated international human rights standards and those established in its own constitution. While calling for additional analysis and discussion on this topic, the authors propose that policymakers should reject double standards of this kind and instead embrace the challenge of implementing the highest standard of care on a global level.",eng,Health and human rights,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27653022,10.1002/cpdd.309,Management of Hypertension With a Fixed-Dose (Single-Pill) Combination of Bisoprolol and Amlodipine.,"Hypertension is currently one of the greatest global health care challenges. Although many effective drugs are available, combinations of 2 or more medications are often required to meet clinical targets. Combination therapy has several advantages over monotherapy: lower doses of each drug can be used to achieve therapeutic goals; lower doses may lead to fewer adverse events, facilitating patient adherence; and using multiple drugs with different modes of action may be more effective in treating multifactorial diseases, including hypertension. Adherence is an important consideration when requiring patients to self-administer multiple medications; as the number of concurrent medications increases, patient adherence tends to decrease. Recent evidence suggests that fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) may be more effective than free-dose combinations, as they provide all necessary medications in a single convenient tablet/single-pill combination. Among combinations of hypertension medications, a β-blocker such as bisoprolol with a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine is an effective combination therapy for hypertension, with distinct and complimentary modes of action. With advantages over free-dose combinations, the FDC of bisoprolol/amlodipine is thus an effective and convenient treatment for hypertension, allowing more patients to achieve their therapeutic goals, while potentially reducing the burden of hypertension on health care systems.",eng,Clinical pharmacology in drug development,Editorial,2025-04-23,2017

Here, we show that a class of antimicrobial agents, termed 'structurally nanoengineered antimicrobial peptide polymers' (SNAPPs) exhibit sub-μM activity against all Gram-negative bacteria tested, including ESKAPE and colistin-resistant and MDR (CMDR) pathogens, while demonstrating low toxicity. SNAPPs are highly effective in combating CMDR Acinetobacter baumannii infections in vivo, the first example of a synthetic antimicrobial polymer with CMDR Gram-negative pathogen efficacy. Furthermore, we did not observe any resistance acquisition by A. baumannii (including the CMDR strain) to SNAPPs. Comprehensive analyses using a range of microscopy and (bio)assay techniques revealed that the antimicrobial activity of SNAPPs proceeds via a multimodal mechanism of bacterial cell death by outer membrane destabilization, unregulated ion movement across the cytoplasmic membrane and induction of the apoptotic-like death pathway, possibly accounting for why we did not observe resistance to SNAPPs in CMDR bacteria. Overall, SNAPPs show great promise as low-cost and effective antimicrobial agents and may represent a weapon in combating the growing threat of MDR Gram-negative bacteria.",eng,Nature microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

It is difficult to evaluate the extent of carriage of resistant bacteria in the population. Sewage sampling is a possible way to monitor populations. We evaluated the presence of pan-resistant bacteria in Israeli sewage collected from all over Israel, by modifying the pour plate method for heterotrophic plate count technique using commercial selective agar plates. This method enables convenient and fast sewage sampling and detection. We found that sewage in Israel contains multiple pan-resistant bacteria including carbapenemase resistant Enterobacteriacae carrying blaKPC and blaNDM-1, MRSA and VRE. blaKPC carrying Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter cloacae were the most common Enterobacteriacae drug resistant bacteria found in the sewage locations we sampled. Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Citrobacter spp. were the 4 main CRE isolated from Israeli sewage and also from clinical samples in our clinical microbiology laboratory. Hospitals and Community sewage had similar percentage of positive samplings for blaKPC and blaNDM-1. VRE was found to be more abundant in sewage in Israel than MRSA but there were more locations positive for MRSA and VRE bacteria in Hospital sewage than in the Community. Therefore, our upgrade of the pour plate method for heterotrophic plate count technique using commercial selective agar plates can be a useful tool for routine screening and monitoring of the population for pan-resistant bacteria using sewage.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This is largely due to the fact that many pathogens have developed strategies to acquire resistance to antibiotics. Metallo-β-lactamases (MBL) have evolved to inactivate most of the commonly used β-lactam antibiotics. AIM-1 is one of only a few MBLs from the B3 subgroup that is encoded on a mobile genetic element in a major human pathogen. Here, its mechanism of action was characterised with a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic techniques and compared to that of other MBLs. Unlike other MBLs it appears that AIM-1 has two avenues available for the turnover of the substrate nitrocefin, distinguished by the identity of the rate-limiting step. This observation may be relevant with respect to inhibitor design for this group of enzymes as it demonstrates that at least some MBLs are very flexible in terms of interactions with substrates and possibly inhibitors.",eng,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27777980,10.1172/jci.insight.89880,Ly6Chi monocytes regulate T cell responses in viral hepatitis.,"Viral hepatitis remains a global health challenge despite recent progress in the development of more effective therapies. Although virus-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses are essential for viral clearance, it remains largely unknown what regulates T cell-mediated viral clearance. Thus, a better understanding of the regulation of anti-viral T cell immunity would be critical for the design of more effective therapies for viral hepatitis. Using a model of adenovirus-induced hepatitis, here we showed that adenoviral infection induced recruitment of Ly6Chi monocytes to the liver in a CCR2-dependent manner. These recruited Ly6Chi monocytes suppressed CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses to adenoviral infection, leading to a delay in viral clearance. In vivo depletion of Ly6Chi monocytes markedly enhanced anti-viral T cell responses and promoted viral clearance. Mechanistically, we showed that induction of iNOS and the production of NO by Ly6Chi monocytes are critical for the suppression of T cell responses. In addition, a contact-dependent mechanism mediated by PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction is also required for T cell suppression by Ly6Chi monocytes. These findings suggest a critical role for Ly6Chi monocytes in the regulation of T cell immunity in viral hepatitis and may provide new insights into development of more effective therapies for treating viral hepatitis based on targeting the immunosuppressing monocytes.",eng,JCI insight,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Host-directed immune modulating therapies have been suggested as adjunctive treatment to TB antibiotics. Upregulated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling pathway may cause a dysfunctional immune response that favors survival and replication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb).--NEW SECTION--Blood samples were obtained from patients with latent TB (n = 9) and active TB (n = 33) before initiation of anti-TB chemotherapy. COX-2 expression in monocytes and ESAT-6 and Ag85 specific T cell cytokine responses (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2), proliferation (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester staining) and regulation (FOXP3+ T regulatory cells) were analysed by flow cytometry and the in vitro effects of the COX-1/2 inhibitor indomethacin were measured.--NEW SECTION--We demonstrate that indomethacin significantly down-regulates the fraction of Mtb specific FOXP3+ T regulatory cells (ESAT-6; p = 0.004 and Ag85; p < 0.001) with a concomitant reduction of Mtb specific cytokine responses and T cell proliferation in active TB. Although active TB tend to have higher levels, there are no significant differences in COX-2 expression between unstimulated monocytes from patients with active TB compared to latent infection. Monocytes in both TB groups respond with a significant upregulation of COX-2 after in vitro stimulation.--NEW SECTION--Taken together, our in vitro data indicate a modulation of the Th1 effector and T regulatory cells in Mtb infection in response to the COX-1/2 inhibitor indomethacin.

Losses in confidence in vaccines and immunization programmes can lead to vaccine reluctance and refusal, risking disease outbreaks and challenging immunization goals in high- and low-income settings. National and international immunization stakeholders have called for better monitoring of vaccine confidence to identify emerging concerns before they evolve into vaccine confidence crises.--NEW SECTION--We perform a large-scale, data-driven study on worldwide attitudes to immunizations. This survey - which we believe represents the largest survey on confidence in immunization to date - examines perceptions of vaccine importance, safety, effectiveness, and religious compatibility among 65,819 individuals across 67 countries. Hierarchical models are employed to probe relationships between individual- and country-level socio-economic factors and vaccine attitudes obtained through the four-question, Likert-scale survey.--NEW SECTION--Overall sentiment towards vaccinations is positive across all 67 countries, however there is wide variability between countries and across world regions. Vaccine-safety related sentiment is particularly negative in the European region, which has seven of the ten least confident countries, with 41% of respondents in France and 36% of respondents in Bosnia & Herzegovina reporting that they disagree that vaccines are safe (compared to a global average of 13%). The oldest age group (65+) and Roman Catholics (amongst all faiths surveyed) are associated with positive views on vaccine sentiment, while the Western Pacific region reported the highest level of religious incompatibility with vaccines. Countries with high levels of schooling and good access to health services are associated with lower rates of positive sentiment, pointing to an emerging inverse relationship between vaccine sentiments and socio-economic status.--NEW SECTION--Regular monitoring of vaccine attitudes - coupled with monitoring of local immunization rates - at the national and sub-national levels can identify populations with declining confidence and acceptance.

Here we propose a novel strategy which instead exploits evolution to generate and sustain new control tools. Effective spatial repellents are needed to keep vectors out of houses. Our approach generates such new repellents by combining a high-toxicity insecticide with a candidate repellent initially effective against only part of the vector population. By killing mosquitoes that enter treated properties the insecticide selects for vector phenotypes deflected by the repellent, increasing efficacy of the repellent against the target vector population and in turn protecting the insecticide against the spread of insecticide resistance. Using such evolved spatial repellents offers an evolutionarily sustainable, 'double-dip' system of disease control combining mortality and repellence. We formalize this idea using models which explore vector population genetics and disease transmission probabilities and show that using evolved spatial repellents is theoretically achievable, effective and sustainable.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Introducing novel agents is fraught with hurdles, thus adapting known antibiotic classes by altering their chemical structure could be a way forward. A chemical addition to existing antibiotics known as a siderophore could be a solution to the gram-negative resistance issue.

Historically, large-scale diagnostic test implementation has been slow and incomplete because of service delivery and other challenges. Building on lessons from the past, in this Personal View we propose a new framework to accelerate viral load scale-up and ensure equitable access to this essential test. The framework includes the following steps: (1) ensuring adequate financial investment in scaling up this test; (2) achieving pricing agreements and consolidating procurement to lower prices of the test; (3) strengthening functional tiered laboratory networks and systems to expand access to reliable, high-quality testing across countries; (4) strengthening national leadership, with prioritisation of laboratory services; and (5) demand creation and uptake of test results by clinicians, nurses, and patients, which will be vital in ensuring viral load tests are appropriately used to improve the quality of care. The use of dried blood spots to stabilise and ship samples from clinics to laboratories, and the use of point-of-care diagnostic tests, will also be important for ensuring access, especially in settings with reduced laboratory capacity. For countries that have just started to scale up viral load testing, lessons can be learnt from countries such as Botswana, Brazil, South Africa, and Thailand, which have already established viral load programmes. This framework might be useful for guiding the implementation of viral load with the aim of achieving the new global HIV 90-90-90 goals by 2020.",eng,The Lancet.

While several promising drug and vaccine trials for EBOV are ongoing, options for LASV infection are currently limited to ribavirin treatment. A major factor impeding the development of antiviral compounds to treat these infections is the need to manipulate the virus under BSL-4 containment, limiting research to a few institutes worldwide. Here we describe the development of a novel LASV minigenome assay based on the ambisense LASV S segment genome, with authentic terminal untranslated regions flanking a ZsGreen (ZsG) fluorescent reporter protein and a Gaussia princeps luciferase (gLuc) reporter gene. This assay, along with a similar previously established EBOV minigenome, was optimized for high-throughput screening (HTS) of potential antiviral compounds under BSL-2 containment. In addition, we rescued a recombinant LASV expressing ZsG, which, in conjunction with a recombinant EBOV reporter virus, was used to confirm any potential antiviral hits in vitro. Combining an initial screen to identify potential antiviral compounds at BSL-2 containment before progressing to HTS with infectious virus will reduce the amount of expensive and technically challenging BSL-4 containment research. Using these assays, we identified 6-azauridine as having anti-LASV activity, and demonstrated its anti-EBOV activity in human cells. We further identified 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocytidine as having potent anti-LASV activity, with an EC50 value 10 times lower than that of ribavirin.",eng,Antiviral research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

First, ARVs often require life-long use and complex dosing regimens. This results in low patient adherence and periods of lapsed treatment manifesting in drug resistance. This has prompted the development of alternate dosage forms such as vaginal rings and long-acting injectables that stand to improve patient adherence. Another problem central to therapeutic failure is the inadequate penetration of drugs into infected tissues. This can lead to incomplete treatment, development of resistance, and viral rebound.

Methods: All trauma patients presenting to the main regional referral hospital were included in the trauma registry. A pilot study retrospectively analyzed data from the first two months after implementation. Results: From March to April 2013, 572 trauma patients were entered into the database. Average age was 26.9 years. Ten percent of patients presented more than 24 hours after injury. Most common mechanisms of injury were falls (25.5%), motor vehicle collisions (23.3%), and blunt assault (10.5%). Interim analysis revealed that 99% of patients were entered into the database. However, documentation of vital signs was poor: 42% of patients had temperature, 26% had oxygen saturation documented. After reporting to registry staff, a significant increase in temperature (42 to 97%, P < 0.001) and oxygen saturation (26 to 92%, P < 0.001) documentation was observed. Conclusion: A trauma registry is possible to implement in a resource-poor setting. Future efforts will focus on analysis of data to enhance prevention and treatment of injuries in Iquitos.",eng,Health promotion perspectives,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27766037,10.7150/ijbs.15154,Deficiency of DJ-1 Ameliorates Liver Fibrosis through Inhibition of Hepatic ROS Production and Inflammation.,"Liver fibrosis is a global health problem and previous studies have demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in fibrogenesis. Parkinson disease (autosomal recessive, early onset) 7 (Park7) also called DJ-1 has an essential role in modulating cellular ROS levels. DJ-1 therefore may play functions in liver fibrogenesis and modulation of DJ-1 may be a promising therapeutic approach. Here, wild-type (WT) and DJ-1 knockout (DJ-1 KO) mice were administrated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) to induce liver fibrosis or acute liver injury. Results showed that DJ-1 depletion significantly blunted liver fibrosis, accompanied by marked reductions in liver injury and ROS production. In the acute CCl4 model, deficiency of DJ-1 showed hepatic protective functions as evidenced by decreased hepatic damage, reduced ROS levels, diminished hepatic inflammation and hepatocyte proliferation compared to WT mice. In vitro hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation assays indicated that DJ-1 has no direct effect on the activation of HSCs in the context of with or without TGFβ treatment. Thus our present study demonstrates that in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, DJ-1 deficiency attenuates mice fibrosis by inhibiting ROS production and liver injury, and further indirectly affecting the activation of HSCs. These results are in line with previous studies that ROS promote HSC activation and fibrosis development, and suggest the therapeutic value of DJ-1 in treatment of liver fibrosis.",eng,International journal of biological sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27765888,10.1093/tropej/fmw077,Neonatal Sepsis in Haiti.,"Infections (including sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia and tetanus) stand as a major contributor to neonatal mortality in Haiti (22%). Infants acquire bacteria that cause neonatal sepsis directly from the mother's blood, skin or vaginal tract either before or during delivery. Nosocomial and environmental pathogens introduce further risk after delivery. The absence of cohesive medical systems and methods for collecting information limits the available data in countries such as Haiti. This study seeks to add more information on the burden of severe bacterial infections and their etiology in neonates of Haiti. Researchers conducted a secondary retrospective analysis of a de-identified database from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Nos Petit Frères et Soeurs-St. Damien Hospital (NPFS-SDH). Records from 1292 neonates admitted to the NICU at NPFS-SDH in Port-au-Prince Haiti from 2013 to 2015 were reviewed. Sepsis accounted for 708 of 1292 (54.8%) of all admissions to the NICU. Infants admitted for sepsis had a mortality rate of 23% (163 of 708 infants admitted for sepsis). The most common organism cultured was Streptococcus agalactiae, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeroginusa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabillis Failure to order or obtain a culture was associated with an increased fatality (odds ratio 2.4) for infants with sepsis.

Millennium Development Goal 4 focused efforts on reducing rates by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. In Ethiopia, child mortality rates dropped 71 % from 1990 to 2015, however it is estimated that 184,000 Ethiopian children die each year. There is limited information about pediatric hospital admissions in Ethiopia. Our aims were to examine the temporal relationship of mortality to admission, describe the demographics, and identify cause mortality of children admitted to the Zewditu Memorial Hospital (ZMH).--NEW SECTION--A four-year retrospective review of pediatric admissions was conducted at the pediatric emergency room and pediatric hospital ward at ZMH in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Admission entries from 2011-2014 of children age 29 days-14 years were reviewed. Age, gender, admission date, disease classification, discharge status and date were obtained. Patient gender was compared using Chi-square analysis. A descriptive analysis was used for age and cause mortality.--NEW SECTION--A total of 6866 patient entries were reviewed. The proportion of admissions younger than age 5 was 0.747 (95 % CI 0.736-0.757). Overall mortality was 0.042 (95 % CI, 0.037-0.047). The proportion of recorded deaths occurring within 2 days of admission was 0.437 (95 % CI 0.380-0.494). The proportion of male admissions was significantly higher than female admissions in all age groups (male 0.575, p < 0.0001, 95 % CI 0.562-0.586). The main causes of mortality were pneumonia (0.253, 95 % CI, 0.203-0.303), severe acute malnutrition (0.222, 95 % CI 0.174-0.27), HIV/AIDS-related complications (0.056, 95 % CI 0.029-0.083), spina bifida (0.049, 95 % CI 0.024-0.074), and hydrocephalus (0.045, 95 % CI 0.021-0.069).--NEW SECTION--Our study revealed a lower mortality rate than previously reported in Ethiopia. Despite this, 44 % of pediatric hospital mortality occurred early during hospitalization, higher than reported at other Ethiopian hospitals. This adds further evidence that systematic efforts should be dedicated to improve pediatric emergency care. Admissions included 58 % male patients, similar to other reports in Ethiopia implying that this may be a nation-wide phenomenon. The observed disparity may be due to societal factors regarding care-seeking behaviors or male predilection for respiratory illness warranting further investigation.

Using quantitative maternal surface antigen (HBsAg) to predict HBV infection in infants has not been investigated. We enrolled 526 mother-infant pairs with positive maternal HBsAg under current immunoprophylaxis. Maternal viral load and quantitative HBsAg were measured in the peripartum period. Infant HBsAg seropositivity for more than 6 months was defined as chronic infection. Rates of chronic infection in infants at various maternal HBsAg levels were estimated using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results showed that maternal HBsAg was positively correlated with maternal viral load (r = 0.69; P < 0.001) and accurately predicted maternal viral load above 6, 7, and 8 log10 IU/mL with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.97, 0.98, and 0.95. Nineteen infants were chronically infected. After adjustment for the other risk factor, maternal HBsAg level was significantly associated with risk of infection (adjusted odds ratio for each log10 IU/mL increase, 15.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.89-57.94; P < 0.001). The AUC for predicting infection by quantitative maternal HBsAg was comparable to that by maternal viral load (0.89 vs. 0.87; P = 0.459). Estimated rates of infection at maternal HBsAg levels of 4, 4.5, and 5 log10 IU/mL were 2.4% (95% CI, 0.1-4.6; P = 0.04), 8.6% (95% CI, 4.5-12.7; P < 0.001), and 26.4% (95% CI, 12.6-40.2; P < 0.001).--NEW SECTION--Quantitative maternal HBsAg predicts infection in infants as well as maternal viral load does.

Mounting evidence suggests that, compared with their normal counterparts, many types of cancer cell have increased levels of ROS. Therefore, cancer cells need to combat high levels of ROS, especially at early stages of tumor development. Recent studies have revealed that ROS-mediated regulation of redox-sensitive proteins (redox sensors) is involved in the pathogenesis and/or progression of many human diseases, including cancer. Unraveling the altered functions of redox sensors and the underlying mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis is critical for the development of novel cancer therapeutics. For this reason, redox proteomics has been developed for the high-throughput screening of redox sensors, which will benefit the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HCC. In this review, we will briefly introduce several novel redox proteomics techniques that are currently available to study various oxidative modifications in hepatocarcinogenesis and summarize the most important discoveries in the study of redox processes related to the development and progression of HCC.",eng,Proteomics.

Continuing Medical Education programs are essential in maintaining physician accreditation. Haitian physicians have expressed a lack access to these activities. The Haiti Medical Education Project works in alliance with Haitian medical leadership, faculty and students to support the Country's medical education system. We present the creation, delivery and evaluation of a competency-based continuing medical education curriculum for physicians in rural Haiti.--NEW SECTION--Real time lectures from local and international institutions were teleconferenced to physicians in remote Haitian sites using VidyoConferencing™ technology. With American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and College of Family Physicians Canada (CFPC) guidelines as references, a competency-derived syllabus was created for a Haitian continuing medical education program. The resulting educational goals were reviewed by a committee of Haitian and North American physician/medical education practitioners to reflect local needs. All authors reviewed lectures and then conferred to establish agreement on competencies presented for each lecture.--NEW SECTION--Sixty-seven lectures were delivered. Human immunodeficiency virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, ophthalmologic, infectious diseases, renal and endocrine competencies were well-represented, with more than 50 % of the joint AAFP and CFPC recommended competencies outlined. Areas under-represented included allergy and immunology, cardiology, surgery, pain management, gastroenterology, neurology, pulmonology, men's health and rheumatology; these topics accounted for less than 25 % of AAFP/CFPC recommended competencies. Areas not covered included geriatrics, nutrition, occupational health and women's health.

27759403,NA,Pit and fissure sealants or fluoride varnishes?,"Despite the general advances in dental care, dental caries is still a global health problem affecting many children. Occlusal surfaces of first permanent molars are the most susceptible sites in the developing permanent dentition. Dentists should use sealants or fluoride varnish - as well as other means - to limit the onset of tooth decay. Application of sealants is a recommended procedure to prevent or control caries. Sealing occlusal surfaces of newly erupted permanent molars in children and teenagers delays caries onset up to 48 months compared with unsealed teeth. However longer follow-ups shows a reduction of the preventive effect [Tikhonova et al., 2015]. A review of 2013 pointed out how sealants are effective in high risk children, however information about the benefits of sealing in other conditions is still scant [Ahovuo-Saloranta et al., 2013]. Fluoride varnishes are frequently used to prevent early childhood caries and reduce caries increment in very young children [Weintraub et al., 2006] and in the most vulnerable populations, where the prevalence of caries is higher and specialist visits are occasional [Chu et al., 2010]. Many studies have reported the effectiveness of different types and forms of fluoride agents in preventing dental caries among children and adolescents [Divaris et al., 2013]. A review clarifies that professional application of a 5% sodium fluoride varnish leads to remineralisation of early enamel caries in children. Solutions of 38% silver diamine fluoride are effective in arresting active dentine caries [Gao et al., 2016]. The last systematic review [Ahovuo-Saloranta et al., 2016], comparing pit and fissure sealants with fluoride varnishes explains that the pooled estimate slightly favours resin sealants over fluoride varnishes at two years. At four and nine years, the only comparative study (with high drop-out rates) found more caries on fluoride-varnished occlusal surfaces than on resin-sealed surfaces. There is evidence suggesting the superiority of resin-based fissure sealants over fluoride varnishes for prevention of occlusal caries in permanent molars, however it is not relevant. Eventually, Ahovuo-Saloranta et al. state that current data do not allow to draw definitive conclusions on whether to apply sealants or fluoride varnishes on occlusal surfaces of permanent molars [2016].

Persons with schizophrenia (PWS) have excess mortality (their life expectancy is reduced by 20 %) and excess morbidity. In addition, such persons may have a large number of missing or decayed teeth. Dental caries and periodontal measurement indexes are often twice as high as the level found in the general population. Poor oral health can also affect quality of life and oral health is inseparable from general health. The management of oral health problems needs a multidisciplinary approach. According to the World Health Organization, the aim of therapeutic education (TE) is to help patients take care of themselves and to improve empowerment and recovery. In this educational approach, it is important to take into account the patient's personal experience. Though rarely investigated, the personal experience of PWS in oral health quality of life (OHRQoL) must be used to build a therapeutic educational programme in oral health (TEPOH) in a multidisciplinary approach, and the effectiveness of this program must be evaluated.--NEW SECTION--We report the protocol of a randomized controlled cluster study. This study will be conducted in twelve hospitals in France. We hypothesized that a decrease of 20 % in the proportion of patients with CPI ≥ 3 would establish the effectiveness of TEPOH. Therefore, 12 hospitals will be randomly allocated to either TEPOH or no TEPOH. Altogether, they will have to recruit 230 PWS, who will be randomly allocated with a ratio of 1:1 to one of two conditions: control without intervention versus the group benefitting from TEPOH.--NEW SECTION--If successful, the study will generate methodologically sound results that provide knowledge on the effectiveness of a TEP in oral health for PWS. The results can be used to promote OHRQoL in a global health approach and develop appropriate strategies to encourage and facilitate financial support for healthcare, the multidisciplinary treatment of dental disorders, and the development of training in oral and mental health for caregivers.

Given the many complex and interlinking issues involved in committing to a disease eradication initiative, such commitments must be based on a solid assessment of a broad range of factors. In this chapter, we discuss the value and implications of undertaking a systematic and fact-based analysis of the overall situation prior to embarking on an elimination or eradication programme. As an example, we draw upon insights gained from a series of lymphatic filariasis (LF) studies from our research group that adopted an eradication investment case (EIC) framework. The justification for EICs, and related epidemiological, geospatial and other mathematical/operational research modelling, stems from the necessity for proper planning prior to committing to disease eradication. Across all considerations for LF eradication, including: time, treatments, level of investments necessary, health impact, cost-effectiveness, and broader economic benefits, scaling-up mass drug administration coverage to all endemic communities immediately provided the most favourable results. The coherent and consistent pursuit of eradication goals, operationally tailored to a given socioecological system and based on integrated measures of available tools will lead relatively rapidly to elimination in many parts of endemic areas and provide the cornerstone towards eradication.",eng,Advances in parasitology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of malnutrition among children under-five seen at Bagamoyo District Hospital (BDH) and three rural health facilities ranging between 25 and 55 km from Bagamoyo: Kiwangwa, Fukayosi, and Yombo.--NEW SECTION--A total of 63,237 children under-five presenting to Bagamoyo District Hospital and the three rural health facilities participated in the study. Anthropometric measures of age, height/length and weight and measurements of mid-upper arm circumference were obtained and compared with reference anthropometric indices to assess nutritional status for patients presenting to the hospital and health facilities.--NEW SECTION--Overall proportion of stunting, underweight and wasting was 8.37, 5.74 and 1.41 % respectively. Boys were significantly more stunted, under weight and wasted than girls (p-value < 0.05). Children aged 24-59 months were more underweight than 6-23 months (p-value = <0.0001). But, there was no statistical significance difference between the age groups for stunting and wasting. Children from rural areas experienced increased rates of stunting, underweight and wasting than children in urban areas (p-value < 0.05).

Here, we show that inhibition of G0/G1 switch 2 (G0s2) ameliorates renal inflammation in a mouse model of CKD. Renal expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (Ccl2) was increased in response to p65 activation in the kidneys of wild-type 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) mice. Moreover, 5/6Nx Clk/Clk mice, which carry homozygous mutations in the gene encoding circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), did not exhibit aggravation of apoptosis or induction of F4/80-positive cells. The renal expression of G0s2 in wild-type 5/6Nx mice was important for the transactivation of Ccl2 by p65. These pathologies were ameliorated by G0s2 knockdown.

Consequently, severe adolescent obesity is increasingly being treated surgically. The limited available research examining the effectiveness of adolescent bariatric surgery focuses primarily on bio-medical outcomes. There is a need for a more comprehensive understanding of the behavioural, emotional and social factors which affect adolescents' and parents' experience of weight loss surgery.--NEW SECTION--Patient and parents' perspectives of adolescent LAGB were examined using a qualitative research methodology. Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight adolescent patients and five parents. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes in the qualitative data.--NEW SECTION--Patients and parents generally considered adolescent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) to be a life-changing experience, resulting in physical and mental health benefits. Factors considered to facilitate weight loss following surgery included parental support and adherence to treatment guidelines. Many adolescents reported experiencing surgical weight loss stigma and challenging interpersonal outcomes after weight loss for which they felt unprepared.--NEW SECTION--Patients and parents perceived LAGB positively. There are opportunities to improve both the experience and outcomes of adolescent LAGB through parental education and enhancements to surgical aftercare programmes.",eng,Obesity surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A cross-sectional, descriptive-correlational design was used to collect data from 184 patients with cancer. The quality of life questionnaire, visual analogue pain scale, and physical health status were used in data collection. The results showed that the mean score for pain was 5, the best functioning was for cognitive scale (M = 75, SD = 29), the worst symptoms experienced by patients was appetite loss (M = 47, SD = 35), a moderate global health status (M = 53, SD = 27), and the mean for sleep disturbance was 43 (SD = 35). Pain and sleep disturbance showed high negative correlations with functional scales of quality of life and positive with symptom scales. The findings showed that the co-occurrence of pain and sleep disturbance was negatively correlated with quality of life (QoL) and positively with symptom scales. The regression analysis revealed that pain and sleep disturbance accounted for a significant proportion of variance in the QoL (p < 0.001), and the highest proportion was in predicting global health status (41.9 %). The findings of this study give evidence about the importance of assessing pain and sleep quality among Palestinian patients with cancer.",eng,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Questions elicited background information on each programme and inquired about curriculum and methods used for teaching oral cancer prevention and early detection.--NEW SECTION--Eight of the 12 (67%) programmes responded. Three (37.5%) reported having a specific oral cancer curriculum. Five (62.5%) require students to perform examinations for signs and symptoms of oral cancer at each clinic visit. Variations exist across the programmes in the number of patients each student sees annually and the number of oral cancer examinations each student performs before graduation. Seven programmes (87.5%) conduct early detection screening in community settings. All programmes included risk assessment associated with tobacco. All other risk factors measured were treated inconsistently.--NEW SECTION--Significant differences in training and experience were reported across Illinois dental hygiene programmes. Training is neither standardized nor uniformly comprehensive. Students' preparation for delivering prevention and early detection services to their patients could be strengthened to ensure competence including reflection of risk factors and behaviours in a global context. Regular review of curricular guidelines and programme content would help dental hygienists meet the expectations of the Crete Declaration on Oral Cancer Prevention.,eng,International journal of dental hygiene,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

One possible explanation is poor quality of clinical care. We assess facility quality and estimate the association of facility quality with neonatal mortality in Malawi.--NEW SECTION--Data on facility infrastructure as well as processes of routine and basic emergency obstetric care for all facilities in the country were obtained from 2013 Malawi Service Provision Assessment. Birth location and mortality for children born in the preceding two years were obtained from the 2013-2014 Millennium Development Goals Endline Survey. Facilities were classified as higher quality if they ranked in the top 25% of delivery facilities based on an index of 25 predefined quality indicators. To address risk selection (sicker mothers choosing or being referred to higher-quality facilities), we employed instrumental variable (IV) analysis to estimate the association of facility quality of care with neonatal mortality. We used the difference between distance to the nearest facility and distance to a higher-quality delivery facility as the instrument. Four hundred sixty-seven of the 540 delivery facilities in Malawi, including 134 rated as higher quality, were linked to births in the population survey. The difference between higher- and lower-quality facilities was most pronounced in indicators of basic emergency obstetric care procedures. Higher-quality facilities were located a median distance of 3.3 km further from women than the nearest delivery facility and were more likely to be in urban areas. Among the 6,686 neonates analyzed, the overall neonatal mortality rate was 17 per 1,000 live births. Delivery in a higher-quality facility (top 25%) was associated with a 2.3 percentage point lower newborn mortality (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.046, 0.000, p-value 0.047). These results imply a newborn mortality rate of 28 per 1,000 births at low-quality facilities and of 5 per 1,000 births at the top 25% of facilities, accounting for maternal and newborn characteristics. This estimate applies to newborns whose mothers would switch from a lower-quality to a higher-quality facility if one were more accessible. Although we did not find an indication of unmeasured associations between the instrument and outcome, this remains a potential limitation of IV analysis.--NEW SECTION--Poor quality of delivery facilities is associated with higher risk of newborn mortality in Malawi. A shift in focus from increasing utilization of delivery facilities to improving their quality is needed if global targets for further reductions in newborn mortality are to be achieved.",eng,PLoS medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The study assessed HPV awareness and receptivity towards receiving the HPV vaccine. Multivariable logistic regression explored statistically significant relationships between the predictor variables and both outcomes.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-seven percent had heard of HPV. Among those who had heard of HPV (n = 616), only 28% indicated willingness to vaccinate. Multivariable analysis showed that respondents from rural areas had 63% higher odds (95% CI: 1.24, 2.12) of having heard of HPV than those in urban areas. Respondents with fathers who had completed higher education had 41% higher odds (95% CI: 1.04, 1.92) of being aware of HPV (P < 0.05); however, every level of father's education (as compared to no education at all) was negatively associated with willingness to vaccinate. Respondents who had previously spoken to a healthcare professional about the HPV vaccine had 80% higher odds (95% CI: 1.16, 2.81) of willingness to vaccinate than those who did not speak to a provider about the vaccine.--NEW SECTION--Healthcare providers and parents are important stakeholders in disseminating HPV vaccine information. Given the overall low levels of awareness, there is a great opportunity for public health communication efforts to craft health messaging and information in a way to maximise receptivity, outlining benefits and providing information on the minimal risks associated with the vaccine.",eng,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017
27754524,NA,[Global health: a Latin American vision].,"This article presents a Latin American vision of global health from a counterhegemonic perspective, applicable to various countries of the world in similar circumstances. It begins by reviewing several concepts and trends in global health and outlining the differences between conventional public health, international health, and global health, but without seeing them as antagonistic, instead situating them in a model that is based on global health and also includes the other two disciplines. It is understood that global factors influenced earlier theories, schemes, and models of classic international health. The article emphasizes the importance of several aspects of world-geopolitics and economic globalization that impose constraints on world health; it also underscores the theory of social and environmental determinants of the health-disease spectrum, which have impacts beyond those of epidemiologic risk factors. The suggested approach is based on cosmopolitanism and holism: global philosophical and political currents that allow for a better interpretation of world phenomena and are more relevant because they give rise to lines of action. Structurally, the theoretical foundations of global health are presented in three analytical areas: global justice and equity, governance and the supranational protection of rights, and holism and a new global consciousness. The article concludes by underscoring the need to construct an approach to the existence and praxis of global public health that is based on the Latin American perspective, an approach that highlights grassroots social movements as an alternative way to secure a new order and global awareness of rights and to redefine the architecture of global health governance.",spa,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, in the more recent conflicts over the past two decades, their role in health care delivery as a component of medical stability operations has been largely undefined. The purpose of this study was to explore the types of missions supported by U.S. military dietitians and characterize any unique competencies critical to their success during these missions using an online questionnaire. Sixty-five military dietitians responded to an online questionnaire and 49 (75%) shared their deployment experiences, lessons learned, and recommendations for future training based on 57 deployments from 1975 to 2014. Results indicated that during these deployments nutrition- and dietetics-related competencies were capitalized along with staff positions in support of combat and humanitarian operations. The majority (n = 24; 51%) valued mentorship as a useful resource before deployments followed by field experience (45%) and Web-based training (43%).

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the most frequently isolated pathogen causing TD. Although TD is self-limiting, it is also severely incapacitating. Ciprofloxacin is one of the standard quinolone antibiotics used in patients with TD. However, the alarming levels of antibiotic resistance have necessitated the urgent need to identify new drugs. The drug target of ciprofloxacin is gyrA, which is exclusively present in prokaryotes and essential for bacterial survival. Several mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA are associated with increased quinolone resistance in vivo, which accounts for reduced affinity toward quinolones. To understand the molecular events underlying the mechanism of drug resistance, we report, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the structural and dynamic effects of mutations in ETEC gyrA on ciprofloxacin affinity in comparison with the wild-type protein. Our simulations reveal that mutations significantly alter the gyrA residue interaction network and overall pattern of global dominant motions in major distinctive domains of N-terminal regions of gyrA. This study therefore provides important insights for the design of more potent antibacterial agents with high ligand efficacy for treating drug-resistant bacterial infections, including the TD that continues to adversely impact global health and international travel.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We used data on comorbidities, medication, presenting symptoms, and vital signs, and laboratory test results to develop a scoring system for severe LGIB (defined as continuous and/or recurrent bleeding). We validated the risk score in a prospective study of 161 patients with acute LGIB admitted to the same center from April 2014 through April 2015. We assessed the system's accuracy in predicting patient outcome using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) analysis. All patients underwent colonoscopy.--NEW SECTION--In the first study, 29% of the patients developed severe LGIB. We devised a risk scoring system based on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use, no diarrhea, no abdominal tenderness, blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or lower, antiplatelet drugs use, albumin level less than 3.0 g/dL, disease scores of 2 or higher, and syncope (NOBLADS), which all were independent correlates of severe LGIB. Severe LGIB developed in 75.7% of patients with scores of 5 or higher compared with 2% of patients without any of the factors correlated with severe LGIB (P < .001). The NOBLADS score determined the severity of LGIB with an AUC value of 0.77. In the validation (second) study, severe LGIB developed in 35% of patients; the NOBLADS score predicted the severity of LGIB with an AUC value of 0.76. Higher NOBLADS scores were associated with a requirement for blood transfusion, longer hospital stay, and intervention (P < .05 for trend).--NEW SECTION--We developed and validated a scoring system for risk of severe LGIB based on 8 factors (NOBLADS score).

As policy, government and civil society assemble in response, there are still gaps to be addressed. The Manifesto on Hepatitis C and Drug Use, launched in Berlin during the Correlation Hepatitis C Initiative conference in October 2014, was formulated and endorsed by many key organizations in the hepatitis field. The Manifesto takes strides to pinpoint shortcomings in hepatitis action oriented towards the population most affected by the hepatitis C virus (HCV): active drug users. Despite a considerable amount of evidence that active drug users are disproportionately affected by HCV, barriers to care remain. Engagement with representatives of communities of people who inject drugs (PWID) is imperative in order to effectively create guidelines which reflect reality. Unfortunately, widespread systemic stigmatization and lack of trust between affected communities, decision-makers and healthcare professionals have reproduced this divide. The Berlin Manifesto has identified a disconnect between evidence and action which must be answered. In this roundtable discussion, experts from diverse parts of the hepatitis community have contributed their perspectives and experience on access to prevention, testing, and treatment for HCV in PWID. The authors discuss relevant topics such as realities of access to HCV treatment in the United Kingdom, interventions of a regional network of active drug users in Europe and lack of PWID involvement in government policy in Catalonia. Collectively they challenge the neglect of HCV in PWID by many decision-makers and health care professionals and promote a scale-up of integrated prevention and treatment strategies focusing on this population.

Zika virus is a Flavivirus, and is transmitted to humans by Aedes species mosquitoes. In May 2015, the World Health Organization reported the first locally acquired transmission of ZIKV in Brazil, the first case in the Western Hemisphere. There have also been reports of increased incidence of microcephaly and other neurologic complications associated with ZIKV infection, as well as a 20-fold increase in the incidence of Guillain-Barre Syndrome during ZIKV outbreaks. In light of the clusters of microcephaly and neurologic manifestations in areas of ZIKV transmission, the World Health Organization declared ZIKV and associated complications an international public health emergency. The clinical presentations of ZIKV disease resemble many common infections, making the diagnosis of ZIKV disease a clinical challenge. Patients with ZIKV infection may have other coinfections that can distract clinicians from suspecting ZIKV disease in their patients. Complications from ZIKV, although uncommon, may be severe. Therefore, it is important for health care providers to remain alert and up to date in the efforts to control this emerging global health crisis. It is critical for physicians and other providers to know the growing list of countries and territories on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list of nations with endemic ZIKV disease and to work closely with local health departments to prevent spread.

Transcriptional regulation of fat has received much attention, and key transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism, such as SBP-1/SREBP, LPD-2/C/EBP, and MDT-15, are conserved from nematodes to mammals. However, there is a growing awareness that lipid metabolism can also be controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans RNase, REGE-1, related to MCPIP1/Zc3h12a/Regnase-1, a key regulator of mammalian innate immunity, promotes accumulation of body fat. Using exon-intron split analysis, we find that REGE-1 promotes fat by degrading the mRNA encoding ETS-4, a fat-loss-promoting transcription factor. Because ETS-4, in turn, induces rege-1 transcription, REGE-1 and ETS-4 appear to form an auto-regulatory module. We propose that this type of fat regulation may be of key importance when, if faced with an environmental change, an animal must rapidly but precisely remodel its metabolism.",eng,Developmental cell,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In this study, the urinary excretion, as well as the time-course distributions of various arsenic species in murine tissues, especially in different brain regions were determined after a single oral administration of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20mg/kg sodium arsenite (NaAsO2). Our data showed that the peak times of urinary, hepatic and nephritic total arsenic (TAs) were happened at about 1h, then TAs levels decreased gradually and almost could not be observed after 72h. On contrast, the time course of TAs in lung, urinary bladder and different brain regions exhibited an obvious process of accumulation and elimination,and the peak times were nearly at 6h to 9h. TAs levels of 10 and 20mg/kg NaAsO2 groups were significantly higher than 2.5 and 5mg/kg groups, and the amounts of TAs in 5mg/kg groups were in the order of liver>lung>kidney>urinary bladder>hippocampus>cerebral cortex>cerebellum. In addition, iAs was the most abundant species in liver and kidney, while lung and urinary bladder accumulated the highest concentrations of dimethylated arsenicals (DMA). What's more, the distributions of arsenic species were not homogeneous among different brain regions, as DMA was the sole species in cerebral cortex and cerebellum, while extremely high concentrations and percentages of monomethylated arsenicals (MMA) were found in hippocampus. These results demonstrated that distributions of iAs and its methylated metabolites were tissue-specific and even not homogeneous among different brain regions, which must be considered as to the tissue- and region-specific toxicity of iAs exposure.

27741963,10.1016/j.cger.2016.06.012,Assessment and Measurement of Pain in Adults in Later Life.,Pain in aging adults is a global health problem requiring a proactive and consistent assessment approach. Pain assessment is critical to detecting pain and developing a collaborative and adaptive pain management plan. Getting health providers to assess and measure pain even in older adults who are communicative and can self-report remains a challenge. Self-report is the best method for identifying pain. Using a validated pain assessment scale is key to evaluate pain intensity. This article discusses techniques to obtain self-report and describe appropriate self-report pain tools for a focused pain assessment and reassessment in adults in later life.,eng,Clinics in geriatric medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-risk regions with about 100 million new cases each year worldwide. The cumulative dengue diseases burden has attained an unprecedented proportion in recent times with sharp increase in the size of human population at risk. The management of dengue virus infection is essentially supportive and symptomatic and no specific treatment is available for increasing the fallen platelets, which have a significant role in causing the mortality of dengue patient.This study was conducted to evaluate the platelet increasing efficacy of Carica papaya leaf extract (CPLE) in patients with dengue fever (DF).--NEW SECTION--The administration of Carica papaya leaf extract should significantly increase the platelet count in cases of thrombocytopenia associated with dengue, preventing the patient to go in DHF or DSS conditions.--NEW SECTION--A Multi-centric, Double blind, Placebo controlled, Randomized, prospective study was conducted in 300 patients across 5 centres', to evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Carica Papaya Leaf Extract, as empirical therapy for thrombocytopenia associated with dengue fever. The subjects were randomized into two groups, as control and intervention group. Both the groups were managed by the standard management guidelines for dengue except steroid administration. In addition to this, the intervention group received CPLE tablet three times daily for five days. All of them were followed daily with platelet monitoring. This study has been registered in the clinical trial registry-India (CTRI Registration number: CTRI/2015/05/005806).--NEW SECTION--The results indicate that CPLE had significant increase(p< 0.01) in the platelet count over the therapy duration, in dengue fever patients, confirming CPLE accelerates the increase in platelet count compared to the control group. There were few adverse events related to GI disturbance like nausea and vomiting which were similar in both groups.--NEW SECTION--Thus this study concluded that Carica papaya leaf extract (CPLE) does significantly increase the platelet count in patients with thrombocytopenia associated with dengue with fewer side effects and good tolerability.",eng,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A number of structural and scientific factors explain this growth and there has been much discussion of these in the literature. Little, if any, attention has been paid, however, to the factors identified by scientists and other research actors as important to successful research collaboration. This is surprising given that their decisions are likely to play a key role in the sustainability and effectiveness of global health research initiatives. In this paper, we report on qualitative research with leading scientists involved in major international research collaborations about their views on good and bad collaborations and the factors that inform their decision-making about joining and participating actively in research networks. We identify and discuss eight factors that researchers see as essential in judging the merits of active participation in global health research collaborations: opportunities for active involvement in cutting-edge, interesting science; effective leadership; competence of potential partners in and commitment to good scientific practice; capacity building; respect for the needs, interests and agendas of partners; opportunities for discussion and disagreement; trust and confidence; and, justice and fairness in collaboration. Our findings suggest that the sustainability and effectiveness of global health research collaborations has an important ethical or moral dimension for the research actors involved.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27735841,10.3390/ijms17101681,The Fascinating Effects of Baicalein on Cancer: A Review.,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and a major global health problem. In recent decades, the rates of both mortality and morbidity of cancer have rapidly increased for a variety of reasons. Despite treatment options, there are serious side effects associated with chemotherapy drugs and multiple forms of drug resistance that significantly reduce their effects. There is an accumulating amount of evidence on the pharmacological activities of baicalein (e.g., anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, and antitumor effects). Furthermore, there has been great progress in elucidating the target mechanisms and signaling pathways of baicalein's anti-cancer potential. The anti-tumor functions of baicalein are mainly due to its capacities to inhibit complexes of cyclins to regulate the cell cycle, to scavenge oxidative radicals, to attenuate mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase B (Akt) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activities, to induce apoptosis by activating caspase-9/-3 and to inhibit tumorinvasion and metastasis by reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 (MMP-2/-9). In this review, we focused on the relevant biological mechanisms of baicalein involved in inhibiting various cancers, such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. Moreover, we also summarized the specific mechanisms by which baicalein inhibited the growth of various tumors in vivo. Taken together, baicalein may be developed as a potential, novel anticancer drug to treat tumors.",eng,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27732606,10.1371/journal.pone.0163083,A Data-Driven Evaluation of the Stop TB Global Partnership Strategy of Targeting Key Populations at Greater Risk for Tuberculosis.,"Identifying those infected with tuberculosis (TB) is an important component of any strategy for reducing TB transmission and population prevalence. The Stop TB Global Partnership recently launched an initiative with a focus on key populations at greater risk for TB infection or poor clinical outcomes, due to housing and working conditions, incarceration, low household income, malnutrition, co-morbidities, exposure to tobacco and silica dust, or barriers to accessing medical care. To achieve operational targets, the global health community needs effective, low cost, and large-scale strategies for identifying key populations. Using South Africa as a test case, we assess the feasibility and effectiveness of targeting active case finding to populations with TB risk factors identified from regularly collected sources of data. Our approach is applicable to all countries with TB testing and census data. It allows countries to tailor their outreach activities to the particular risk factors of greatest significance in their national context.--NEW SECTION--We use a national database of TB test results to estimate municipality-level TB infection prevalence, and link it to Census data to measure population risk factors for TB including rates of urban households, informal settlements, household income, unemployment, and mobile phone ownership. To examine the relationship between TB prevalence and risk factors, we perform linear regression analysis and plot the set of population characteristics against TB prevalence and TB testing rate by municipality. We overlay lines of best fit and smoothed curves of best fit from locally weighted scatter plot smoothing.--NEW SECTION--Higher TB prevalence is statistically significantly associated with more urban municipalities (slope coefficient β1 = 0.129, p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.133), lower mobile phone access (β1 = -0.053, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.089), lower unemployment rates (β1 = -0.020, p = 0.003, R2 = 0.048), and a lower proportion of low-income households (β1 = -0.048, p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.084). Municipalities with more low-income households also have marginally higher TB testing rates, however, this association is not statistically significant (β1 = -0.025, p = 0.676, R2 = 0.001). There is no relationship between TB prevalence and the proportion of informal settlement households (β1 = 0.021, p = 0.136, R2 = 0.014).--NEW SECTION--These analyses reveal that the set of characteristics identified by the Global Plan as defining key populations do not adequately predict populations with high TB burden. For example, we find that higher TB prevalence is correlated with more urbanized municipalities but not with informal settlements. We highlight several factors that are counter-intuitively those most associated with high TB burdens and which should therefore play a large role in any effective targeting strategy. Targeting active case finding to key populations at higher risk of infection or poor clinical outcomes may prove more cost effective than broad efforts. However, these results should increase caution in current targeting of active case finding interventions.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27731861,10.2196/mededu.5336,Enabling Access to Medical and Health Education in Rwanda Using Mobile Technology: Needs Assessment for the Development of Mobile Medical Educator Apps.,"Lack of access to health and medical education resources for doctors in the developing world is a serious global health problem. In Rwanda, with a population of 11 million, there is only one medical school, hence a shortage in well-trained medical staff. The growth of interactive health technologies has played a role in the improvement of health care in developed countries and has offered alternative ways to offer continuous medical education while improving patient's care. However, low and middle-income countries (LMIC) like Rwanda have struggled to implement medical education technologies adapted to local settings in medical practice and continuing education. Developing a user-centered mobile computing approach for medical and health education programs has potential to bring continuous medical education to doctors in rural and urban areas of Rwanda and influence patient care outcomes.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this study is to determine user requirements, currently available resources, and perspectives for potential medical education technologies in Rwanda.--NEW SECTION--Information baseline and needs assessments data collection were conducted in all 44 district hospitals (DHs) throughout Rwanda. The research team collected qualitative data through interviews with 16 general practitioners working across Rwanda and 97 self-administered online questionnaires for rural areas. Data were collected and analyzed to address two key questions: (1) what are the currently available tools for the use of mobile-based technology for medical education in Rwanda, and (2) what are user's requirements for the creation of a mobile medical education technology in Rwanda?--NEW SECTION--General practitioners from different hospitals highlighted that none of the available technologies avail local resources such as the Ministry of Health (MOH) clinical treatment guidelines. Considering the number of patients that doctors see in Rwanda, an average of 32 patients per day, there is need for a locally adapted mobile education app that utilizes specific Rwandan medical education resources. Based on our results, we propose a mobile medical education app that could provide many benefits such as rapid decision making with lower error rates, increasing the quality of data management and accessibility, and improving practice efficiency and knowledge. In areas where Internet access is limited, the proposed mobile medical education app would need to run on a mobile device without Internet access.--NEW SECTION--A user-centered design approach was adopted, starting with a needs assessment with representative end users, which provided recommendations for the development of a mobile medical education app specific to Rwanda. Specific app features were identified through the needs assessment and it was evident that there will be future benefits to ongoing incorporation of user-centered design methods to better inform the software development and improve its usability. Results of the user-centered design reported here can inform other medical education technology developments in LMIC to ensure that technologies developed are usable by all stakeholders.",eng,JMIR medical education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This transition began two decades ago in high-income countries and has more recently begun in lower income, HIV endemic countries (HIV-ECs). With this transition, there has been a concurrent shift in clinical and public health burden from AIDS-related complications and opportunistic infections to those associated with well-controlled HIV disease, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the current treatment era, traditional CVD risk factors and HIV-related factors both contribute to an elevated risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias. In HIV-ECs, the high prevalence of persons living with HIV and growing prevalence of CVD risk factors will contribute to a growing epidemic of HIV-associated CVD.

From a situation where wild type poliovirus was endemic in 125 countries across five continents, transmission is now limited to regions of just three countries - Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria. A sharp increase in Pakistan's poliomyelitis cases in 2014 prompted the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee to declare the situation a 'public health emergency of international concern'. Global polio eradication hinges on Pakistan's ability to address the religious, political and socioeconomic barriers to immunisation; including discrepancies in vaccine coverage, a poor health infrastructure, and conflict in polio-endemic regions of the country.

Orphans and separated children (OSC) are a vulnerable population whose numbers are increasing, particularly in resource-poor settings. Understanding whether and how OSC are engaged in civic activities is important for community and world leaders who need to provide care for OSC and ensure their involvement in sustainable development.--NEW SECTION--The Positive Outcomes for Orphans study (POFO) is a multi-country, longitudinal cohort study of OSC randomly sampled from institution-based care and from family-based care, and of non-OSC sampled from the same study regions. Participants represent six sites in five low-and middle-income countries. We examined civic engagement activities and government trust among subjects > =16 years old at 90-month follow-up (approximately 7.5 years after baseline). We calculated prevalences and estimated the association between key demographic variables and prevalence of regular volunteer work using multivariable Poisson regression, with sampling weights to accounting for the complex sampling design.--NEW SECTION--Among the 1,281 POFO participants > =16 who were assessed at 90-month follow-up, 45 % participated in regular community service or volunteer work; two-thirds of those volunteers did so on a strictly voluntary basis. While government trust was fairly high, at approximately 70 % for each level of government, participation in voting was only 15 % among those who were > =18 years old. We did not observe significant associations between demographic characteristics and regular volunteer work, with the exception of large variation by study site.--NEW SECTION--As the world's leaders grapple with the many competing demands of global health, economic security, and governmental stability, the participation of today's youth in community and governance is essential for sustainability.

These data were complemented by a review of project reports.--NEW SECTION--The results indicated that the ARCADE projects have been successful in developing and delivering courses, and have reached over 920 postgraduate students. Some partners thought the north-south and south-south partnerships that evolved during the project were the main achievement. However, others found there to be a 'north-south divide' in certain aspects. Challenges included technical constraints and quality assurance. Additionally, adapting new teaching and learning methods into current university systems was challenging, combined with not being able to award students with credits for their degrees.--NEW SECTION--The ARCADE projects were introduced as an innovative and ambitious project idea, although not designed appropriately for all partner institutions.

Blended learning (BL, a form of e-learning combining face-to-face or real-time interaction with computer-assisted learning) is a promising approach for increasing GH research capacity in low- to middle-income countries. Implementing BL, however, requires additional skills and efforts from lecturers. This paper explores lecturers' views and experiences of delivering BL courses within the context of two north-south collaborative research capacity building projects, ARCADE HSSR and ARCADE RSDH.--NEW SECTION--We used a qualitative approach to explore the experiences and perceptions of 11 lecturers involved in designing and delivering BL courses collaboratively across university campuses in four countries (South Africa, Uganda, India and Sweden). Data were collected using interviews in person or via Skype. Inductive qualitative content analysis was used.--NEW SECTION--Participants reported that they felt BL increased access to learning opportunities and made training more flexible and convenient for adult learners, which were major motivations to engage in BL. However, despite eagerness to implement and experiment with BL courses, they lacked capacity and support, and found the task time consuming. They needed to make compromises between course objectives and available technological tools, in the context of poor Internet infrastructure.--NEW SECTION--BL courses have the potential to build bridges between low- and middle-income contexts and between lecturers and students to meet the demand for GH training. Lecturers were very motivated to try these approaches but encountered obstacles in implementing BL courses.

ARCADE HSSR and ARCADE RSDH (African Regional Capacity Development for Health Systems and Services Research; Asian Regional Capacity Development for Research on Social Determinants of Health) were unique capacity-building projects, focusing on developing BL in Africa and Asia on issues related to global health.--NEW SECTION--We aimed to evaluate the student experience of participating in any of five ARCADE BL courses implemented collaboratively at institutions from Africa, Asia, and Europe.--NEW SECTION--A post-course student survey with 118 students was conducted. The data were collected using email or through an e-learning platform. Data were analysed with SAS, using bivariate and multiple logistic regression. We focused on the associations between various demographic and experience variables and student-reported overall perceptions of the courses.--NEW SECTION--In total, 82 students responded to the survey.

In contrast, perceiving the assessment as adequate was associated with a worse perception of overall usefulness. In a multiple regression, the course, experiencing no technical problems, and perceiving the discussion as adequate remained significantly associated with a more positively rated perception of the usefulness of the online component of the blended courses.--NEW SECTION--The results suggest that lack of technical problems and functioning discussion forums are of importance during BL courses focusing on global health-related topics.

Blended learning (BL), combining face-to-face teaching with computer-based technologies, is also an accessible and flexible education method for teaching global health and related topics. When organised as inter-institutional collaboration, BL also has potential for sharing teaching resources. However, there is insufficient data on the costs of BL in higher education.--NEW SECTION--Our goal was to evaluate the total provider costs of BL in teaching health research methods in a three-university collaboration.--NEW SECTION--A retrospective evaluation was performed on a BL course on randomised controlled trials, which was led by Stellenbosch University (SU) in South Africa and joined by Swedish and Ugandan universities. For all three universities, the costs of the BL course were evaluated using activity-based costing with an ingredients approach. For SU, the costs of the same course delivered with a classroom learning (CL) approach were also estimated. The learning outcomes of both approaches were explored using course grades as an intermediate outcome measure.--NEW SECTION--In this contextually bound pilot evaluation, BL had substantially higher costs than the traditional CL approach in South Africa, even when average per-site or per-student costs were considered. Staff costs were the major cost driver in both approaches, but total staff costs were three times higher for the BL course at SU. This implies that inter-institutional BL can be more time consuming, for example, due to use of new technologies. Explorative findings indicated that there was little difference in students' learning outcomes.--NEW SECTION--The total provider costs of the inter-institutional BL course were higher than the CL course at SU.

Medical discoveries are frequently licensed exclusively to one producer, allowing a monopoly and inequitable pricing. Similarly, research is often published in ways that make it inaccessible. Universities can adopt policies and practices to overcome neglect and ensure equitable access to research and its products.--NEW SECTION--For 25 United Kingdom universities, data on health research funding were extracted from the top five United Kingdom funders' databases and coded as research on neglected diseases (NDs) and/or health in low- and lower-middle-income countries (hLLMIC). Data on intellectual property licensing policies and practices and open-access policies were obtained from publicly available sources and by direct contact with universities. Proportions of research articles published as open-access were extracted from PubMed and PubMed Central.--NEW SECTION--Across United Kingdom universities, the median proportion of 2011-2014 health research funds attributable to ND research was 2.6% and for hLLMIC it was 1.7%. Overall, 79% of all ND funding and 74% of hLLMIC funding were granted to the top four institutions within each category. Seven institutions had policies to ensure that technologies developed from their research are affordable globally. Mostly, universities licensed their inventions to third parties in a way that confers monopoly rights. Fifteen institutions had an institutional open-access publishing policy; three had an institutional open-access publishing fund. The proportion of health-related articles with full-text versions freely available online ranged from 58% to 100% across universities (2012-2013); 23% of articles also had a creative commons CC-BY license.--NEW SECTION--There is wide variation in the amount of global health research undertaken by United Kingdom universities, with a large proportion of total research funding awarded to a few institutions. To meet a level of research commitment in line with the global burden of disease, most universities should seek to expand their research activity. Most universities do not license their intellectual property in a way that is likely to encourage access in resource-poor settings, and lack policies to do so. The majority of recent research publications are published open-access, but not as gold standard (CC-BY) open-access.",eng,Health research policy and systems,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27723538,10.1016/j.nedt.2016.08.035,Pain: A content review of undergraduate pre-registration nurse education in the United Kingdom.,"Pain is a global health issue with poor assessment and management of pain associated with serious disability and detrimental socio economic consequences. Pain is also a closely associated symptom of the three major causes of death in the developed world; Coronary Heart Disease, Stroke and Cancer. There is a significant body of work which indicates that current nursing practice has failed to address pain as a priority, resulting in poor practice and unnecessary patient suffering. Additionally nurse education appears to lack focus or emphasis on the importance of pain assessment and its management.--NEW SECTION--A three step online search process was carried out across 71 Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) in the United Kingdom (UK) which deliver approved undergraduate nurse education programmes. Step one to find detailed programme documentation, step 2 to find reference to pain in the detailed documents and step 3 to find reference to pain in nursing curricula across all UK HEI websites, using Google and each HEIs site specific search tool.--NEW SECTION--The word pain featured minimally in programme documents with 9 (13%) documents making reference to it, this includes 3 occurrences which were not relevant to the programme content. The word pain also featured minimally in the content of programmes/modules on the website search, with no references at all to pain in undergraduate pre-registration nursing programmes. Those references found during the website search were for continuing professional development (CPD) or Masters level programmes.--NEW SECTION--In spite of the global importance of pain as a major health issue both in its own right, and as a significant symptom of leading causes of death and illness, pain appears to be a neglected area within the undergraduate nursing curriculum. Evidence suggests that improving nurse education in this area can have positive impacts on clinical practice, however without educational input the current levels of poor practice are unlikely to improve and unnecessary patient suffering will continue. Undergraduate nurse education in the UK needs to review its current approach to content and ensure that pain is appropriately and prominently featured within pre-registration nurse education.",eng,Nurse education today,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Rather than focus on macroeconomic structural adjustment policies, this story draws our attention to microeconomic taxation policies on tobacco, alcohol and sugar now widely recognised as the best strategy to control the global non-communicable disease epidemic. Structural adjustment policies are the product of the shift from statist to market-based development models, which was brought about by neoliberal thinkers like Peter Blau and Deepak Lal. In contrast, taxation policies are the result of a different epistemological rupture in international development: the move from economies and physical capital to people and human capital, advocated by Gary Becker and others. This move was part of wider change, which saw Chicago School economists, under the influence of rational choice theory, redefine the object of their discipline, from the study of markets to individual choices. It was this concern with people and their choices that made it possible for Becker and others to identify the importance of price for the demand for tobacco, alcohol and sugar. The same concern also made it easier for them to recognise that there were inefficiencies in the tobacco, alcohol and sugar markets that required government intervention. This story, I suggest, shows that structural adjustment policies and pro-market ideology do not exhaust the relationship between neoliberalism and global health and should not monopolise how we, as political and social scientists, conceive it.",eng,Critical public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Hence, there is a growing demand for simpler sample extraction, rapid screening results, and intervention of the subsequent analysis in emergency units. In this paper, we reviewed CVD biomarkers in blood- and saliva-based specimens. The history of cardiac biomarkers indicates that in the beginning, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was a widely accepted 'gold standard' marker due to its high specificity and selectivity. Considering the advantages of salivary-based cardiac biomarkers, we examined correlations between non-invasive (salivary) and invasive (blood) diagnoses, and it was found that C-reactive protein (CRP) provides a better correlation. Despite the low abundance of salivary CRP, several reports displayed the detection limit down to pg/ml using existing technologies.

Emerging evidence suggests that time spent sedentary may also interact with mental health. This systematic review examined the associations between sedentary behaviour and mental health problems among adolescents.--NEW SECTION--This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, and applied a quality assessment tool for quantitative studies to identity best available evidence. Following stringent search strategy of the databases; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, Health Source: Nursing and Academic Edition, MEDLINE, PsychARTICLES and PsycINFO, we identified 32 articles eligible for review.--NEW SECTION--All studies reported leisure screen time among adolescents, and two thirds of identified studies examined depressive symptomatology. Other mental health measures were; anxiety symptoms, self-esteem, suicide ideation, loneliness, stress, and psychological distress. Strong consistent evidence was found for the relationship between both depressive symptomatology and psychological distress, and time spent using screens for leisure. Moderate evidence supported the relationship between low self-esteem and screen use. Poorer mental health status was found among adolescents using screen time more than 2-3 h per day, and gender differences exist. Essential information was missing for quality of evidence including heterogeneity in mental health and screen time-based measures, and self-report data collection methods.--NEW SECTION--The findings are of particular significance given the global public health concern of lifestyle-attributed diseases and the possibility for novel approaches to mental health. Future research should examine the psychological impact of reducing time spent using screens for leisure among adolescents, whilst accounting for possible confounding factors such as physical activity and dietary behaviours.

Here, the effects of 80 % ethanol extracts of Salvia plebeia R. Br. (SE) on an induced inflammatory response were investigated.--NEW SECTION--Salvia plebeia R. Br. inhibited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, as well as nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. NO and pro-inflammatory cytokine production was suppressed more effectively by SE of the aerial parts (SE-A) than of the roots (SE-R) of S. plebeia. In BEAS-2B cells, both SE-A and SE-R inhibited the increase in production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. We also investigated the anti-asthmatic effects of SE in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced BALB/c mouse model. SE-A treatment significantly reduced the number of airway eosinophils, IL-4 and IL-13 levels, mucus production, and inflammatory infiltration, as compared with the corresponding levels in the untreated, OVA-induced mice, and had similar effects to dexamethasone.--NEW SECTION--Salvia plebeia ethanol extract ameliorated the induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 and BEAS-2B cells, with more effective inhibition noted for SE-A than for SE-R. SE-A treatment was effective in improving the histopathological changes in the lungs of asthma model mice via modulation of eosinophils and Th2 cytokines.

Although there are effective psychological and pharmaceutical interventions, our best treatments achieve remission rates less than 1/3 and limited sustained recovery. Underpinning this efficacy gap is limited understanding of how complex psychological interventions for depression work. Recent reviews have argued that the active ingredients of therapy need to be identified so that therapy can be made briefer, more potent, and to improve scalability. This in turn requires the use of rigorous study designs that test the presence or absence of individual therapeutic elements, rather than standard comparative randomised controlled trials. One such approach is the Multiphase Optimization Strategy, which uses efficient experimentation such as factorial designs to identify active factors in complex interventions. This approach has been successfully applied to behavioural health but not yet to mental health interventions.--NEW SECTION--A Phase III randomised, single-blind balanced fractional factorial trial, based in England and conducted on the internet, randomized at the level of the patient, will investigate the active ingredients of internet cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression. Adults with depression (operationalized as PHQ-9 score ≥ 10), recruited directly from the internet and from an UK National Health Service Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service, will be randomized across seven experimental factors, each reflecting the presence versus absence of specific treatment components (activity scheduling, functional analysis, thought challenging, relaxation, concreteness training, absorption, self-compassion training) using a 32-condition balanced fractional factorial design (2IV7-2). The primary outcome is symptoms of depression (PHQ-9) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include symptoms of anxiety and process measures related to hypothesized mechanisms.--NEW SECTION--Better understanding of the active ingredients of efficacious therapies, such as CBT, is necessary in order to improve and further disseminate these interventions. This study is the first application of a component selection experiment to psychological interventions in depression and will enable us to determine the main effect of each treatment component and its relative efficacy, and cast light on underlying mechanisms, so that we can systematically enhance internet CBT.--NEW SECTION--Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN24117387 .

Studies reporting ICD use only were excluded. Data were independently double-extracted (except from non-English publications). Subgroup analyses explored variation by extent and region.--NEW SECTION--Eighty-one systems were identified as new, modifications of existing systems, or having been used between 2009 and 2014, with an average of ten systems created/modified each year. Systems had widely varying characteristics: (i) comprehensiveness (40 systems classified both stillbirths and neonatal deaths); (ii) extent of use (systems were created in 28 countries and used in 40; 17 were created for national use; 27 were widely used); (iii) accessibility (three systems available in e-format); (iv) underlying cause of death (64 systems required a single cause of death); (v) reliability (10 systems tested for reliability, with overall Kappa scores ranging from .35-.93); and (vi) ICD alignment (17 systems used ICD codes). Regional databases were not searched, so system numbers may be underestimated. Some non-differential misclassification of systems was possible.--NEW SECTION--The plethora of systems in use, and continuing system development, hamper international efforts to improve understanding of causes of death.

Consequently, antibacterial drugs have become less effective or even ineffective, resulting in a global health security emergency. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) varies widely among regions and countries. The primary aim of antibiotic stewardship programs is to supervise the three most influential factors contributing to the development and transmission of MDROs, namely: (1) appropriate antibiotic prescribing; (2) early detection and prevention of cross-colonization of MDROs; and (3) elimination of reservoirs. In the future, it is expected that a number of countries will experience a rise in MDROs. These infections will be associated with a high consumption of healthcare resources manifested by a prolonged hospital stay and high mortality. As a counteractive strategy, minimization of broad-spectrum antibiotic use and prompt antibiotic administration will aid in reduction of antibiotic resistance. Innovative management approaches include development and implementation of rapid diagnostic tests that will help in both shortening the duration of therapy and allowing early targeted therapy. The institution of more accessible therapeutic drug monitoring will help to optimize drug administration and support a patient-specific approach.

Because of the global spread of resistant bacteria, the efficacy of antibiotics has been severely compromised. S. pneumonia, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas are the predominant pathogens of sepsis and septic shock. It is common for E. coli, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas to be resistant to multiple drugs. Multiple drug resistance is caused by the interplay of multiple resistance mechanisms those emerge via the acquisition of extraneous resistance determinants or spontaneous mutations. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) and quinolone resistance determinants are typically external and disseminate on mobile genetic elements, while porin-efflux mechanisms are activated by spontaneous modifications of inherited structures. Porin and efflux mechanisms are frequent companions of multiple drug resistance in Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa, but only occasionally detected among E. coli and Klebsiella.

Amphiregulin (AREG) is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family that activates growth signaling upon binding of EGF receptors. Elevated AREG expression is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer. Here, we investigated whether increased AREG expression is a disease indicator and/or prognostic biomarker for GC. We used tissue microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess AREG expression in clinical tissue specimens at various stages of GC and a conducted bioinformatics analysis to evaluate the value of AREG over-expression as a GC biomarker. We found that both mRNA and protein expression of AREG were increased in the tissues of GC patients when compared to tissues from non-cancer patients or normal tissues. High expression of AREG was also associated with GC clinicopathological characteristics and poor survival. Thus, over-expression of AREG could serve as a novel GC biomarker, and active surveillance of its expression could be a novel approach to GC diagnosis and monitoring.",eng,Oncotarget,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Expert commentary: Many unknowns still exist regarding ZIKV infections and its long-term effects in neonates. In addition, further studies need to evaluate if genomic differences that have occurred from the African to the Asian lineage of the virus have led to increased virulence of the virus. The authors believe that all pregnant women with fetuses showing microcephaly and/or intracranial calcifications should be tested for ZIKV infection if they cannot recall their sexual partner travel history.

However, no vaccine is currently available for its prevention. Vir genes were the first putative virulent factors associated with P. vivax infections, yet very few studies have examined their potential role as targets of immunity. We investigated the immunogenic properties of five VIR proteins and two long synthetic peptides containing conserved VIR sequences (PvLP1 and PvLP2) in the context of the PregVax cohort study including women from five malaria endemic countries: Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, India and Papua New Guinea (PNG) at different timepoints during and after pregnancy. Antibody responses against all antigens were detected in all populations, with PNG women presenting the highest levels overall. P. vivax infection at sample collection time was positively associated with antibody levels against PvLP1 (fold-increase: 1.60 at recruitment -first antenatal visit-) and PvLP2 (fold-increase: 1.63 at delivery), and P. falciparum co-infection was found to increase those responses (for PvLP1 at recruitment, fold-increase: 2.25). Levels of IgG against two VIR proteins at delivery were associated with higher birth weight (27 g increase per duplicating antibody levels, p<0.05). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PNG uninfected pregnant women had significantly higher antigen-specific IFN-γ TH1 responses (p=0.006) and secreted less pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 after PvLP2 stimulation than P. vivax-infected women (p<0.05). These data demonstrate that VIR antigens induce the natural acquisition of antibody and T cell memory responses that might be important in immunity to P. vivax during pregnancy in very diverse geographical settings.",eng,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Molecular typing of M. tuberculosis has been used for various epidemiologic purposes as well as for clinical management. Currently, many techniques are available to type M. tuberculosis. Choosing the most appropriate technique in accordance with the existing laboratory conditions and the specific features of the geographic region is important. Insertion sequence IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis is considered the gold standard for the molecular epidemiologic investigations of tuberculosis. However, other polymerase chain reaction-based methods such as spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping), which detects 43 spacer sequence-interspersing direct repeats (DRs) in the genomic DR region; mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number tandem repeats, (MIRU-VNTR), which determines the number and size of tandem repetitive DNA sequences; repetitive-sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR), which provides high-throughput genotypic fingerprinting of multiple Mycobacterium species; and the recently developed genome-based whole genome sequencing methods demonstrate similar discriminatory power and greater convenience.

Pulmonary TB assumes utmost significance in the programmatic perspective as it is readily transmissible as well as easily diagnosable. HIV complicates every aspect of pulmonary tuberculosis from diagnosis to treatment, demanding a different approach to effectively tackle both the diseases. In order to control these converging epidemics, it is important to diagnose early, initiate appropriate therapy for both infections, prevent transmission and administer preventive therapy. Liquid culture methods and nucleic acid amplification tests for TB confirmation have replaced conventional solid media, enabling quicker and simultaneous detection of mycobacterium and its drug sensitivity profile Unique problems posed by the syndemic include Acquired rifampicin resistance, drug-drug interactions, malabsorption of drugs and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome or paradoxical reaction that complicate dual and concomitant therapy. While the antiretroviral therapy armamentarium is constantly reinforced by discovery of newer and safer drugs every year, only a few drugs for anti tuberculosis treatment have successfully emerged. These include bedaquiline, delamanid and pretomanid which have entered phase III B trials and are also available through conditional access national programmes. The current guidelines by WHO to start Antiretroviral therapy irrespective of CD4+ cell count based on benefits cited by recent trials could go a long way in preventing various complications caused by the deadly duo. This review provides a consolidated gist of the advancements, concepts and updates that have emerged in the management of HIV-associated pulmonary TB for maximizing efficacy, offering latest solutions for tackling drug-drug interactions and remedial measures for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.",eng,AIDS research and therapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In total 22.5 hours of semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using a framework method.--NEW SECTION--Stakeholders' understanding of IFFIm's financing mechanism and its outcomes varied and many stakeholders wanted more information. Participants highlighted that the change in the macro-economic environment following the 2008 financial crisis affected national policy in donor countries and subsequently the number of new commitments IFFIm received. Since Gavi is now seen as a successful and mature organization, participants stated that donors prefer to donate directly to Gavi. The pharmaceutical industry valued IFFIm for providing funding stability and flexibility. Other stakeholders valued IFFIm's ability to access funds early and enable Gavi to increase vaccine coverage. Overall, stakeholders thought IFFIm was successful, but they had divergent views about IFFIm's on-going role. Participants listed two issues where bond financing mechanisms may be suitable: emergency preparedness and outcome-based time-limited interventions.--NEW SECTION--The benefit of pledging funds through IFFIm needs to be re-evaluated. There are potential uses for bond financing to raise funds for other global health issues, but these must be carefully considered against criteria to establish effectiveness, with quantifiable pre-defined outcome indicators to evaluate performance.",eng,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Pharmacological interventions are often necessary for the management of obesity. Orlistat is an FDA-approved antiobesity drug which is a potent inhibitor of intestinal lipases.--NEW SECTION--In the current study, orlistat was evaluated for its genotoxic potential in human lymphocyte cells in vitro and was compared with that of another antiobesity drug sibutramine, presently withdrawn from market due its undesirable health effects. Caffeine intake may be an additional burden in people using anorectic drugs, therefore, further work is needed to be carried out to evaluate the possible effects of caffeine on orlistat-induced DNA damage.--NEW SECTION--Human lymphocytes were exposed to orlistat (250, 500 and 1000 μg/ml), sibutramine (250, 500 and 1000 μg/ml) and caffeine (25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150 μg/ml) to assess their genotoxicity by comet assay in vitro. In addition, lymphocytes were co-incubated with caffeine (50, 75 and 100 μg/ml) and a single concentration of orlistat (250 μg/ml).--NEW SECTION--Orlistat and sibutramine were genotoxic at all concentrations tested, sibutramine being more genotoxic. Caffeine was found to be genotoxic at concentrations 125 μg/ml and above. Co-treatment of orlistat with non-genotoxic concentrations (50, 75 and 100 μg/ml) of caffeine lead to a decrease in DNA damage.--NEW SECTION--Orlistat can induce DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro and caffeine was found to reduce orlistat-induced genotoxicity.",eng,Drug and chemical toxicology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017
27704591,10.1002/jmv.24705,A cell-based high-throughput protocol to screen entry inhibitors of highly pathogenic viruses with Traditional Chinese Medicines.,"Emerging viruses such as Ebola virus (EBOV), Lassa virus (LASV), and avian influenza virus H5N1 (AIV) are global health concerns. Since there is very limited options (either vaccine or specific therapy) approved for humans against these viruses, there is an urgent need to develop prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. Previously we reported a high-throughput screening (HTS) protocol to identify entry inhibitors for three highly pathogenic viruses (EBOV, LASV, and AIV) using a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudotyping platform which allows us to perform the screening in a BSL-2 facility. In this report, we have adopted this screening protocol to evaluate traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) in an effort to discover entry inhibitors against these viruses. Here we show that extracts of the following Chinese medicinal herbs exhibit potent anti-Ebola viral activities: Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, Citrus aurantium L., Viola yedoensis Makino, Prunella vulgaris L., Coix lacryma-jobi L. var. mayuen (Roman.) Stapf, Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit., and Morus alba L.

Similar in many ways to private-sector commercial franchising, social franchising can be found in sectors with a social objective, such as health care. This article evaluates the World Health Partners (WHP) Sky program, a large-scale social franchising and telemedicine program in Bihar, India. We studied appropriate treatment for childhood diarrhea and pneumonia and associated health care outcomes. We used multivariate difference-in-differences models to analyze data on 67,950 children ages five and under in 2011 and 2014. We found that the WHP-Sky program did not improve rates of appropriate treatment or disease prevalence. Both provider participation and service use among target populations were low. Our results do not imply that social franchising cannot succeed; instead, they underscore the importance of understanding factors that explain variation in the performance of social franchises.

This study provides the first quantitative evidence of GVK EMRI's early impact on population-level infant and maternal health outcomes in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, two Indian states with a combined population of about 145 million people. We found that GVK EMRI coverage is associated with reductions in the probability of neonatal and infant mortality as well as delivery complications (statewide in Andhra Pradesh and in high-mortality districts in Gujarat). However, we found little change in the probability of institutional delivery or skilled birth attendance.

This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of RAMP-DM on patient-reported outcomes. This was a prospective longitudinal study on 1039 diabetes mellitus patients (714/325 RAMP-DM/non-RAMP-DM) managed in primary care setting. 536 and 402 RAMP-DM participants, and 237 and 187 non-RAMP-DM participants were followed up at 12 and 24 months with completed survey, respectively. Patient-reported outcomes included health-related quality of life, change in global health condition and patient enablement measured by Short Form-12 Health Survey version-2 (SF-12v2), Global Rating Scale, Patient Enablement Instrument respectively. The effects of RAMP-DM on patient-reported outcomes were evaluated by mixed effect models. Subgroup analysis was performed by stratifying haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (optimal HbA1c < 7 % and suboptimal HbA1c ≥ 7 %). RAMP-DM with suboptimal HbA1c was associated with greater improvement in SF-12v2 physical component summary score at 12-month (coefficient:3.80; P-value < 0.05) and 24-month (coefficient:3.82;P-value < 0.05), more likely to feel more enabled at 12-month (odds ratio: 2.57; P-value < 0.05), and have improved in GRS at 24-month (odds ratio:4.05; P-value < 0.05) compared to non-RAMP-DM participants. However, there was no significant difference in patient-reported outcomes between RAMP-DM and non-RAMP-DM participants with optimal HbA1c. Participation in RAMP-DM is effective in improving physical component of HRQOL, Global Rating Scale and patient enablement among diabetes mellitus patients with suboptimal HbA1c, but not in those with optimal HbA1c. Patients with sub-optimal diabetes mellitus control should be the priority target population for RAMP-DM.

27699223,10.1172/jci.insight.87680,Heterogeneous fibroblasts underlie age-dependent tertiary lymphoid tissues in the kidney.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical condition defined as a rapid decline in kidney function. AKI is a global health burden, estimated to cause 2 million deaths annually worldwide. Unlike AKI in the young, which is reversible, AKI in the elderly often leads to end-stage renal disease, and the mechanism that prevents kidney repair in the elderly is unclear. Here we demonstrate that aged but not young mice developed multiple tertiary lymphoid tissues (TLTs) in the kidney after AKI. TLT size was associated with impaired renal function and increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and homeostatic chemokines, indicating a possible contribution of TLTs to sustained inflammation after injury. Notably, resident fibroblasts from a single lineage diversified into p75 neurotrophin receptor+ (p75NTR+) fibroblasts and homeostatic chemokine-producing fibroblasts inside TLTs, and retinoic acid-producing fibroblasts around TLTs. Deletion of CD4+ cells as well as late administration of dexamethasone abolished TLTs and improved renal outcomes. Importantly, aged but not young human kidneys also formed TLTs that had cellular and molecular components similar to those of mouse TLTs. Therefore, the inhibition of TLT formation may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for AKI in the elderly.",eng,JCI insight,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This latter and very elderly population is going to significantly rise in the near future given the increase in life expectancy in Western countries, and, most importantly, global health status of elderly patients is improving, justifying appropriate treatments. Changes in treatment paradigm from the old melphalan-prednisone regimen used since the 1970s to its use as a backbone in a nontransplant setting since the late 1990s have highlighted different subgroups in elderly MM. Some ""elderly"" patients could be treated like transplant eligible patients, more likely those aged between 65 and the early 70; while a second group would rather be referred to current approved treatment regimens for the non-transplant setting. A dose-intensity approach seems reasonable for this group, aiming for the best response, eventually the complete response (CR) or even minimal residual disease (MRD). The advent of novel agents such as thalidomide, bortezomib, and most recently lenalidomide have allowed a major improvement in outcome as compared to historical combinations, and soon the novel class of monoclonal antibodies should help to further improve these patients' survival. Nonetheless, elderly patients are more susceptible to side effects and are often unable to tolerate full drug doses, and thus require lower dose intensity regimens, or novel drugs or combinations with more favourable safety profile. Recent developments in MM have focused on identifying these vulnerable patients through geriatric assessment and novel myeloma scoring system, including the notions of frailty, disability and comorbidities. Eventually, we have reached an era in which we should be able to provide individualized treatment strategies and drug doses-""tailored therapy""-to improve tolerability and optimize efficacy and ultimately survival for most elderly MM patients.",eng,Cancer treatment and research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This inequitable state of global health and how it could be improved has become a highly popularized field of academic study. In a series of articles in this journal the roles of power and politics in global health have been addressed in considerable detail. Three points are added here to this debate. The first is consideration of how the use of definitions and common terms, for example 'poverty eradication,' can mask full exposure of the extent of rectification required, with consequent failure to understand what poverty eradication should mean, how this could be achieved and that a new definition is called for. Secondly, a criticism is offered of how the term 'global health' is used in a restricted manner to describe activities that focus on an anthropocentric and biomedical conception of health across the world. It is proposed that the discourse on 'global health' should be extended beyond conventional boundaries towards an ecocentric conception of global/planetary health in an increasingly interdependent planet characterised by a multitude of interlinked crises. Finally, it is noted that the paucity of workable strategies towards achieving greater equity in sustainable global health is not so much due to lack of understanding of, or insight into, the invisible dimensions of power, but is rather the outcome of seeking solutions from within belief systems and cognitive biases that cannot offer solutions. Hence the need for a new framing perspective for global health that could reshape our thinking and actions.",eng,International journal of health policy and management,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Chief among such threats are influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), because of their risk of high transmissibility and acuity of illness. Annual epidemics of seasonal influenza cause an estimated 3-5 million cases of severe illness and more than 500 000 deaths, with the prospect of pandemic influenza viruses causing far greater impact. In addition, the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, widespread and continued outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) since 2004, the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and emergence of MERS CoV in 2012 reflect the seriousness of public health challenges posed by influenza and emerging respiratory infections.",eng,Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,Editorial,2025-04-23,2016

As part of broader big data and digital humanitarianism discourses, there is an emerging interest in data produced through mobile phone communications for enhancing the data environment in such circumstances. This paper assembles user perspectives and critically examines existing evidence and future potential of mobile phone data derived from call detail records (CDRs) and two-way short message service (SMS) platforms, for managing and responding to humanitarian disasters caused by communicable disease outbreaks. We undertake a scoping review of relevant literature and in-depth interviews with key informants to ascertain the: (i) information that can be gathered from CDRs or SMS data; (ii) phase(s) in the disease disaster management cycle when mobile data may be useful; (iii) value added over conventional approaches to data collection and transfer; (iv) barriers and enablers to use of mobile data in disaster contexts; and (v) the social and ethical challenges. Based on this evidence we develop a typology of mobile phone data sources, types, and end-uses, and a decision-tree for mobile data use, designed to enable effective use of mobile data for disease disaster management. We show that mobile data holds great potential for improving the quality, quantity and timing of selected information required for disaster management, but that testing and evaluation of the benefits, constraints and limitations of mobile data use in a wider range of mobile-user and disaster contexts is needed to fully understand its utility, validity, and limitations.",eng,"Geoforum; journal of physical, human, and regional geosciences",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A knowledge translation strategy was implemented as part of a research program. The broker and his team promoted links between actors (health agents, nongovernmental organizations, public administration, policy makers, researchers), provided them with research results related to their needs, and supported them in applying this knowledge in their practices. The strategy was first implemented in Kaya District, Burkina Faso. To increase impact on population health, the strategy included widening the sphere of action through collaboration with the Ministry of Health. The broker was affiliated with a public health consulting firm in the capital, Ouagadougou, and supported by Canadian experts and a senior Burkinabè broker. Evaluation shows that research use increased at the local level among health mutuals, regional nongovernmental organizations, and health professionals in Kaya, but the objective of reaching Ministry of Health decision makers was not achieved. Results highlight the need for better training in knowledge transfer for both local and international researchers and proper identification of the gateways to reach high level decision makers. This ambitious strategy encountered several obstacles: difficult access to decision makers, poor team communication, and broker's nonconducive working environment. Future brokering strategies should analyze the political situation in depth to determine when and how to approach national and regional decision makers; invest time and effort in developing different actors' (including researchers') knowledge transfer skills; and ensure sufficient and good quality communications and resources within the team.",eng,Health systems and reform,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Classification tree analysis (CTA) was used to explore multilevel interactions among key aspects of child and primary caregiver (PCG) psychosocial and physical health affecting dental problems in preschool children. Data were derived from the Growing Up in Ireland study, a nationally representative sample of 9-mo-olds (N = 11,134) in 2007/2008 followed up at age 3 y (N = 9,793) in 2010/2011. Analysis included PCG reports of children's dental problems, general health, temperament, emotional and behavioral difficulties, and their own general health, stress and depression, relationship, and sociodemographic variables. Misclassification costs were specified for the model by applying a higher penalty for misclassifying those with a dental problem (minority class). Logistic regression analyses were carried out for comparison. Dental problems were reported among 302 infants (2.7%) at 9 mo of age and 493 children (5.0%) at 3 y. CTA identified infant temperament (Infant Characteristics Questionnaire unpredictable) as the primary predictor of dental problems at 9 mo and child global health at 3 y of age. First-level predictors were PCG depression score and use of a soother at 9 mo and PCG ethnicity and unscheduled hospital visits at 3 y of age. Regression analyses results supported the most important predictors at 9 mo and 3 y of age. The CTA model for 9-mo-old infants had a specificity of 90.4%, sensitivity of 31.2%, and overall accuracy of 88.8% while that for 3-y-olds had a specificity of 58.5%, sensitivity of 66%, and overall accuracy of 59%. Key aspects of infant/child and PCG health, as well as psychosocial characteristics associated with reported dental problems, should be considered in future multidisciplinary approaches to child health. Knowledge Transfer Statement: The results of this data analysis should help raise awareness among clinicians of how primary caregiver and child psychosocial and general health factors are associated with early childhood dental problems, even before the primary dentition is complete. Classification tree analysis visually demonstrates how factors such as infant temperament (9 mo) and child global health (3 y) can interact at multiple levels and affect different subgroups of the child population. Future intervention strategies for oral health should involve consideration of the psychological and general health characteristics of the young child and PCG at both the patient and population levels. This knowledge could assist decision makers adopt an integrated multidisciplinary approach in formulating a coherent oral health policy for preschool children.",eng,JDR clinical and translational research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27689947,10.3138/jvme.0216-037R,Patients Without Borders: Using Telehealth to Provide an International Experience in Veterinary Global Health for Veterinary Students.,"There is an increasing need to produce veterinarians with knowledge and critical thinking skills that will allow them to participate in veterinary global health equity delivery, particularly in the developing world, where many people remain dependent on animal-based agriculture for a living. This need for veterinarians trained in global health is reflected by the demand among students for greater exposure and education. At the same time, many students are held back from on-site training in global health due to constraints of cost, time, or family obligations. The purpose of this article is to describe the use of a telemedicine approach to educating veterinary students at Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. This approach simultaneously provides expert consultation and support for a pro bono hospital in the developing world. The development of a telemedicine teaching service is discussed, from initial ad hoc email consultation among friends and associates to a more formal use of store-and-forward delivery of data along with real-time videoconferencing on a regular basis, termed tele-rounds. The practicalities of data delivery and exchange and best use of available bandwidth are also discussed, as this very mundane information is critical to efficient and useful tele-rounds. Students are able to participate in discussion of cases that they would never see in their usual clinical sphere and to become familiar with diagnostic and treatment approaches to these cases. By having the patient ""virtually"" brought to us, tele-rounds also decrease the usual carbon footprint of global health delivery.",eng,Journal of veterinary medical education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

In this article, a comprehensive literature search was conducted for the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Greece, since data on the HCV prevalence, viremia and genotypes are important for developing strategies to manage or eliminate HCV infection. In addition, the pattern of HCV infection was analyzed according to the geographic region and the risk factors. These differences reflect not only distinct epidemiological characteristics among populations, but also differences on the strategy of data acquisition and quantification. Although there are not enough data, the estimation of the current prevalence of Hepatitis C in Greece ranges from 0.5% to 2%. The most important risk factors for HCV infection include blood product transfusion, intravenous drug use, chronic hemodialysis, organ transplantation, occupational exposure, sexual transmission, and vertical transmission. Because of lack of vaccine or effective post-exposure prophylaxis for HCV, the main focus of prevention is to recognize and control these risk factors. HCV infection in Greece is closely associated with the development of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma.

One fundamental concern is that mHealth projects are seldom designed from the customer's perspective to address their specific problems and/or create appreciable value. A customer-centric view, where direct tangible benefits of interventions are identified and communicated effectively, can drive customer engagement and advance projects toward self-sustaining business models. This article reviews the business models of 234 mHealth projects to identify nine distinct value propositions that solve specific problems for customers. Each of these value propositions is discussed with real-world examples, analyses of their design approaches and business strategies, and common enablers as well as hurdles to surviving past the pilot stage.

As part of efforts to inform the development of this strategy, the aims of this study, the first of a pair, were (a) to conduct a rapid review of recent analyses of HRH requirements and labour market dynamics in high-income countries who are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and (b) to identify a methodology to determine future HRH requirements for these countries.--NEW SECTION--A systematic search of peer-reviewed literature, targeted website searches, and multi-stage reference mining were conducted. To supplement these efforts, an international Advisory Group provided additional potentially relevant documents. All documents were assessed against predefined inclusion criteria and reviewed using a standardized data extraction tool.--NEW SECTION--In total, 224 documents were included in the review. The HRH supply in the included countries is generally expected to grow, but it is not clear whether that growth will be adequate to meet health care system objectives in the future. Several recurring themes regarding factors of importance in HRH planning were evident across the documents reviewed, such as aging populations and health workforces as well as changes in disease patterns, models of care delivery, scopes of practice, and technologies in health care. However, the most common HRH planning approaches found through the review do not account for most of these factors.--NEW SECTION--The current evidence base on HRH labour markets in high-income OECD countries, although large and growing, does not provide a clear picture of the expected future HRH situation in these countries. Rather than HRH planning methods and analyses being guided by explicit HRH policy questions, most of the reviewed studies appeared to derive HRH policy questions based on predetermined planning methods. Informed by the findings of this review, a methodology to estimate future HRH requirements for these countries is described.",eng,Human resources for health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Through a projected 8.7 million new tuberculosis (TB) cases and 1.4 million mortalities per annum, this deadly infection resulted insubstantial amount of human deaths than any other single organism bacterial infections. TB is one of India's most threatening human health problems and it accounts for approximately 33% of the global health issues. Subsequently, for TB there is an imperative need for the improvement of existing drug candidates with newer targets and specified mechanism of action. Within the wide spectra of heterocycles, benzimidazole and its substituted analogues were evidenced promising biological efficacies enabling them to perform as new drug or prodrug candidates. Exceptional structural features of this class of heterocycle and versatile biological applications made it a privileged structural backbone in new drug design and discovery. Majorly, 2,5- and 2,6-disubstituted benzimidazole derivatives shown to induce significant antiTB potential. To seek more insights on this unique feature of benzimidazole candidates, there is an urgency to assemble the recent advances in this promising area.

BRICS nations remain to be major drivers of such change since 1990s. Governmental, private and out-of-pocket health expenditures were analyzed based on WHO sources. Medium-term projections of national health spending to 2025 were provided based on macroeconomic budgetary excess growth model. In terms of per capita spending Russia was highest in 2013. India's health expenditure did not match overall economic growth and fell to slightly less than 4% of GDP. Up to 2025 China will achieve highest excess growth rate of 2% and increase its GDP% spent on health care from 5.4% in 2012 to 6.6% in 2025. Russia's spending will remain highest among BRICS in absolute per capita terms reaching net gain from $1523 PPP in 2012 to $2214 PPP in 2025. In spite of BRICS' diversity, all countries were able to significantly increase their investments in health care. The major setback was bold rise in out-of-pocket spending. Most of BRICS' growing share of global medical spending was heavily attributable to the overachievement of People's Republic of China. Such trend is highly likely to continue beyond 2025.

Over the past decade there has been considerable interest surrounding high-intensity interval training (HIIT), with advocates claiming it can induce health benefits of similar, if not superior magnitude to moderate-intensity continuous exercise, despite reduced time commitment. As the safety of HIIT becomes clearer, focus has shifted away from using HIIT in healthy individuals towards using this form of training in clinical populations. The continued growth of metabolic disease and reduced physical activity presents a global health challenge and effective therapies are urgently required.

Extensive studies of individual promoters have revealed that heterogeneous RNA 5' ends contribute to the complexity of HBV transcriptome and proteome. Here, we provide a comprehensive map of HBV transcription start sites (TSSs) in human liver, HCC, and blood, as well as several experimental replication systems, at a single-nucleotide resolution. Using CAGE (cap analysis of gene expression) analysis of 16 HCC/nontumor liver pairs, we identify 17 robust TSSs, including a novel promoter for the X gene located in the middle of the gene body, which potentially produces a shorter X protein translated from the conserved second start codon, and two minor antisense transcripts that might represent viral noncoding RNAs. Interestingly, transcription profiles were similar in HCC and nontumor livers, although quantitative analysis revealed highly variable patterns of TSS usage among clinical samples, reflecting precise regulation of HBV transcription initiation at each promoter. Unlike the variety of TSSs found in liver and HCC, the vast majority of transcripts detected in HBV-positive blood samples are pregenomic RNA, most likely generated and released from liver. Our quantitative TSS mapping using the CAGE technology will allow better understanding of HBV transcriptional responses in further studies aimed at eradicating HBV in chronic carriers.--NEW SECTION--Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, HBV infection remains a global health problem, and current antiviral protocols are not able to eliminate the virus in chronic carriers. Previous studies of the regulation of HBV transcription have described four major promoters and two enhancers, but little is known about their activity in human livers and HCC. We deeply sequenced the HBV RNA 5' ends in clinical human samples and experimental models by using a new, sensitive and quantitative method termed cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE). Our data provide the first comprehensive map of global TSS distribution over the entire HBV genome in the human liver, validating already known promoters and identifying novel locations. Better knowledge of HBV transcriptional activity in the clinical setting has critical implications in the evaluation of therapeutic approaches that target HBV replication.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, over the next few decades, over 10,000 publications on Burkitt lymphoma would influence many facets of oncology research including immunology, molecular genetics, chemotherapy, and viral oncology. At the time of discovery, its distribution in equatorial Africa was unique; it was where a child was born and lived, and not what race they were, that conveyed the greatest incidence risk. Its association with Epstein-Barr virus brought attention to the possibility that oncogenesis may be influenced by viruses. The influence that Burkitt lymphoma had on furthering oncology is far-reaching, and it is fitting that the physician credited with bringing attention to this disease was himself broad in his influence. Denis Burkitt was a humanitarian surgeon whose work was not limited to Burkitt lymphoma: he instigated a plan to rid an entire Ugandan district of yaws, he designed and created affordable orthopaedic equipment that could be locally produced in Kampala, and he was an early advocate of a high fiber diet.

Although minimum standards have been proposed, they may not be applicable in resource-limited settings.--NEW SECTION--The goal was to identify reasonable minimum standards to provide safe and effective care for acutely ill children in resource-limited settings.--NEW SECTION--Using previously proposed standards from the International Federation of Emergency Medicine (IFEM), a modified Delphi approach was used to reach agreement regarding minimum standards for PEM in resource-limited settings. Three rounds of surveys were electronically distributed to physicians working in resource-limited settings. Those standards with >67% agreement advanced to the subsequent round.--NEW SECTION--The categories of the surviving criteria included integrated service design, child and family-friendly care, initial assessment of the ill child, stabilising and treating an ill child, staff training and competence, equipment, supplies and medications, quality and safety, child protection, and advanced training and academic research.--NEW SECTION--Experts with experience in acute care of children in resource-limited settings have prioritised standards for paediatric emergency care. They identified 26 variables in nine domains from the original IFEM list of standards and two additional free text standards for the care of acutely ill children. This list may serve as a helpful guide for emergency centres to provide medical treatment for acutely ill children in resource-limited settings.",eng,Paediatrics and international child health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

A descriptive case study was conducted by evaluation of four implemented programs by the author. All programs were conducted with students majoring in nursing and healthcare, where the researcher was a program director, professor, or facilitator. These programs were analyzed in terms of students' needs assessment, program design, and implementation and evaluation factors. The concept and composition of global nursing competence, identified within previous studies, were deemed appropriate in all of our programs. Program composition varied from curricular to extracurricular domains. During the implementation phase, some of the programs included non-Korean students to improve cultural diversity and overcome language barriers. Qualitative and quantitative surveys were conducted to assess program efficacy. Data triangulation from students' reflective journals was examined. Additionally, students' awareness regarding changes within global health nursing, improved critical thinking, cultural understanding, and global leadership skills were investigated pre- and post-program implementation. The importance of identifying students' needs regarding global nursing competence when developing appropriate curricula is discussed.",eng,Frontiers in public health,Case Reports,2025-04-23,2016

Routinely used TB diagnostic methods, in most endemic areas, are time-consuming, often less-sensitive, expensive and inaccessible to most patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of early, easy to use and effective diagnosis tools of TB, which can be effectively integrated into resource limited settings, to anticipate the early treatment and limit further spread of the disease. Over the last decade, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays have become a powerful tool for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases because of the simplicity of device requirements. Indeed, LAMP is a simple, quick and cost effective Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification diagnostic test (INAAT) that has the potential to be used in TB endemic settings of resource-poor countries.--NEW SECTION--In the present study, we have developed a simple and rapid TB molecular diagnostic test using a Single-Step Loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (SS-LAMP) method for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains, with a simplified sample preparation procedure, eliminating DNA extraction prior to LAMP amplification, DNA initial denaturation and enzymatic inactivation steps during the amplification process. To perform our in-house SS-LAMP assay, a set of six specific primers was specifically designed to recognize eight distinct regions on the MTBC species-specific repetitive insertion sequence 6110 (IS6110). The amplification of the targeted DNA was carried out under isothermal conditions at 65 °C within 1 h. Our protocol was firstly optimized using 60 of confirmed MTBC isolates and a recombinant pGEMeasy-IS6110 vector for sensitivity testing. Thereafter, the assay was evaluated on liquefied sputum specimens collected from 157 Moroccan patients suspected of having TB.--NEW SECTION--Our SS-LAMP developed assay was able to detect MTBC DNA directly from liquefied sputum samples without any prior DNA extraction, denaturation nor the final enzymatic inactivation step. When compared to routinely used Löwenstein Jensen (LJ) Culture method, our SS-LAMP assay is rapid and showed specificity and sensitivity of 99.14 % and 82.93 % respectively which are within the international standards. In addition, the limit of detection of our assay was found to be as little as 10 copies of bacterial DNA.--NEW SECTION--To our knowledge, this is the first study using a single step LAMP (SS-LAMP) procedure as a rapid, easy to perform and cost effective testing for TB early detection. This innovative assay could be suitable for low-income countries with restricted health equipment facilities.",eng,BMC infectious diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

While the major risk factors for this malignancy, mostly lifestyle related, have been identified, around 15% of oral cancer cases remain unexplained. In light of evidence implicating bacteria in the aetiology of some cancer types, several epidemiological studies have been conducted in the last decade, employing methodologies ranging from traditional culture techniques to 16S rRNA metagenomics, to assess the possible role of bacteria in OSCC. While these studies have demonstrated differences in microbial composition between cancerous and healthy tissues, they have failed to agree on specific bacteria or patterns of oral microbial dysbiosis to implicate in OSCC. On the contrary, some oral taxa, particularly Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, show strong oral carcinogenic potential in vitro and in animal studies. Bacteria are thought to contribute to oral carcinogenesis via inhibition of apoptosis, activation of cell proliferation, promotion of cellular invasion, induction of chronic inflammation, and production of carcinogens. This narrative review provides a critical analysis of and an update on the association between bacteria and oral carcinogenesis and the possible mechanisms underlying it.",eng,Journal of oral microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Efforts to regenerate β-cells have been advancing rapidly in the past two decades with progress made towards identifying new agents that induce β-cells regeneration. ANGPTL8, also named betatrophin, has been recently identified as a hormone capable of inducing β-cells proliferation and increasing β-cells mass in rodents. Its discovery has been cherished as a breakthrough and a game changer in the field of β-cells regeneration. Initially, ANGPTL8 has been identified as atypical member of the angiopoietin-like protein family as a regulator of triglyceride in plasma through its interaction with ANGPTL3 and its regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity. In this review, we will review literature on the proposed role of ANGPTL8 in β-cells proliferation, the controversy regarding this role, and the emerging data questioning its involvement in β-cells proliferation. Additionally we will discuss new clinical data that describes its role in diabetes and the putative therapeutic targeting of this protein.",eng,Journal of diabetes research,Review,2025-04-23,2016

Initial attempts focused on repurposing drugs that had been developed for other therapeutic areas but these agents did not meet their goals in clinical trials. Attempts to find new lead compounds employing target-based screens were unsuccessful as the leads were inactive against M. tuberculosis Greater success was achieved using phenotypic screening against live tubercle bacilli and this gave rise to the drugs bedaquiline, pretomanid and delamanid, currently in phase III trials. Subsequent phenotypic screens also uncovered new leads and targets but several of these targets proved to be promiscuous and inhibited by a variety of seemingly unrelated pharmacophores. This setback sparked an interest in alternative screening approaches that mimic the disease state more accurately. Foremost among these were cell-based screens, often involving macrophages, as these should reflect the bacterium's niche in the host more faithfully. A major advantage of this approach is its ability to uncover functions that are central to infection but not necessarily required for growth in vitro For instance, inhibition of virulence functions mediated by the ESX-1 secretion system severely attenuates intracellular M. tuberculosis, preventing intercellular spread and ultimately limiting tissue damage. Cell-based screens have highlighted the druggability of energy production via the electron transport chain and cholesterol metabolism. Here, I review the scientific progress and the pipeline, but warn against over-optimism due to the lack of industrial commitment for tuberculosis drug development and other socio-economic factors.This article is part of the themed issue 'The new bacteriology'.",eng,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Much remains to be learned about how Brucella spp. succeed in sabotaging immune host cells and how Brucella spp. respond to environmental challenges. Multiple types of bacteria employ the prokaryotic second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) to coordinate responses to shifting environments. To determine the role of c-di-GMP in Brucella physiology and in shaping host-Brucella interactions, we utilized c-di-GMP regulatory enzyme deletion mutants. Our results show that a ΔbpdA phosphodiesterase mutant producing excess c-di-GMP displays marked attenuation in vitro and in vivo during later infections. Although c-di-GMP is known to stimulate the innate sensor STING, surprisingly, the ΔbpdA mutant induced a weaker host immune response than did wild-type Brucella or the low-c-di-GMP guanylate cyclase ΔcgsB mutant. Proteomics analysis revealed that c-di-GMP regulates several processes critical for virulence, including cell wall and biofilm formation, nutrient acquisition, and the type IV secretion system. Finally, ΔbpdA mutants exhibited altered morphology and were hypersensitive to nutrient-limiting conditions. In summary, our results indicate a vital role for c-di-GMP in allowing Brucella to successfully navigate stressful and shifting environments to establish intracellular infection.",eng,Infection and immunity,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Motorised transport is a major cause of the greenhouse gas emissions that are threatening human health. Urban and transport planning and urban design policies in many cities do not reflect the accumulating evidence that, if policies would take health effects into account, they could benefit a wide range of common health problems. Enhanced research translation to increase the influence of health research on urban and transport planning decisions could address many global health problems. This paper illustrates the potential for such change by presenting conceptual models and case studies of research translation applied to urban and transport planning and urban design. The primary recommendation of this paper is for cities to actively pursue compact and mixed-use urban designs that encourage a transport modal shift away from private motor vehicles towards walking, cycling, and public transport. This Series concludes by urging a systematic approach to city design to enhance health and sustainability through active transport and a move towards new urban mobility. Such an approach promises to be a powerful strategy for improvements in population health on a permanent basis.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A key part of the solution is city planning that reduces non-communicable diseases and road trauma while also managing rapid urbanisation. This Series of papers considers the health impacts of city planning through transport mode choices. In this, the first paper, we identify eight integrated regional and local interventions that, when combined, encourage walking, cycling, and public transport use, while reducing private motor vehicle use. These interventions are destination accessibility, equitable distribution of employment across cities, managing demand by reducing the availability and increasing the cost of parking, designing pedestrian-friendly and cycling-friendly movement networks, achieving optimum levels of residential density, reducing distance to public transport, and enhancing the desirability of active travel modes (eg, creating safe attractive neighbourhoods and safe, affordable, and convenient public transport). Together, these interventions will create healthier and more sustainable compact cities that reduce the environmental, social, and behavioural risk factors that affect lifestyle choices, levels of traffic, environmental pollution, noise, and crime. The health sector, including health ministers, must lead in advocating for integrated multisector city planning that prioritises health, sustainability, and liveability outcomes, particularly in rapidly changing low-income and middle-income countries. We recommend establishing a set of indicators to benchmark and monitor progress towards achievement of more compact cities that promote health and reduce health inequities.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We used bluetongue virus (BTV) and its natural sheep host to reveal a previously uncharacterized mechanism used by an arbovirus to manipulate host immunity. Our study shows that BTV, similarly to other antigens delivered through the skin, is transported rapidly via the lymph to the peripheral lymph nodes. Here, BTV infects and disrupts follicular dendritic cells, hindering B-cell division in germinal centers, which results in a delayed production of high affinity and virus neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the humoral immune response to a second antigen is also hampered in BTV-infected animals. Thus, an arbovirus can evade the host antiviral response by inducing an acute immunosuppression. Although transient, this immunosuppression occurs at the critical early stages of infection when a delayed host humoral immune response likely affects virus systemic dissemination and the clinical outcome of disease.",eng,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Adipogenesis is one of the key pathways that increases the mass of adipose tissue, by which preadipocytes mature into adipocytes through cell differentiation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), the chief regulator of adipogenesis, has been acutely investigated as a molecular target for natural products in the development of anti-obesity treatments. In this review, the regulation of PPARγ expression by natural products through inhibition of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), increased expression of GATA-2 and GATA-3 and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway were analyzed. Furthermore, the regulation of PPARγ transcriptional activity associated with natural products through the antagonism of PPARγ and activation of Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were discussed. Lastly, regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by natural products, which might regulate both PPARγ expression and PPARγ transcriptional activity, was summarized. Understanding the role natural products play, as well as the mechanisms behind their regulation of PPARγ activity is critical for future research into their therapeutic potential for fighting obesity.",eng,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The 2009 World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Health Risks Report was used as a framework to determine the prevalence and number of eight key risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in men and women with psychosis. Differences in the number and type of risk factors by age and gender were investigated. Multi-predictor analysis was performed to identify associations between demographic factors, psychiatric diagnosis and accumulative CVD risk factors.--NEW SECTION--Women had fewer CVD risk factors than men. The number of risk factors significantly decreased in association with single marital status, current employment and significantly increased with earning a higher income. People aged 35-49years and 50-64years had an average of 4 risk factors (SD 1.38 and 1.30); people aged 18-34years had an average of 3 risk factors (SD 1.30). Mean risk factors were higher in the middle age and older age groups (35-49years and 50-64years) compared with the younger age group (18-34years) (p<0.0001). Overweight/obesity, hypertension, high blood glucose/diabetes and high cholesterol were significantly more prevalent in older men and women.--NEW SECTION--People with psychosis have a high prevalence of individual and aggregate CVD risks.

Although obesity is a global health burden, the accumulation of abdominal visceral fat is the specific cardio-metabolic disease risk factor. Here, we explore links between the fecal microbiota and abdominal adiposity using body composition as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in a large sample of twins from the TwinsUK cohort, comparing fecal 16S rRNA diversity profiles with six adiposity measures.--NEW SECTION--We profile six adiposity measures in 3666 twins and estimate their heritability, finding novel evidence for strong genetic effects underlying visceral fat and android/gynoid ratio. We confirm the association of lower diversity of the fecal microbiome with obesity and adiposity measures, and then compare the association between fecal microbial composition and the adiposity phenotypes in a discovery subsample of twins. We identify associations between the relative abundances of fecal microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and abdominal adiposity measures. Most of these results involve visceral fat associations, with the strongest associations between visceral fat and Oscillospira members. Using BMI as a surrogate phenotype, we pursue replication in independent samples from three population-based cohorts including American Gut, Flemish Gut Flora Project and the extended TwinsUK cohort. Meta-analyses across the replication samples indicate that 8 OTUs replicate at a stringent threshold across all cohorts, while 49 OTUs achieve nominal significance in at least one replication sample. Heritability analysis of the adiposity-associated microbial OTUs prompted us to assess host genetic-microbe interactions at obesity-associated human candidate loci. We observe significant associations of adiposity-OTU abundances with host genetic variants in the FHIT, TDRG1 and ELAVL4 genes, suggesting a potential role for host genes to mediate the link between the fecal microbiome and obesity.--NEW SECTION--Our results provide novel insights into the role of the fecal microbiota in cardio-metabolic disease with clear potential for prevention and novel therapies.",eng,Genome biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Laboratory evaluation of simulated 'wear' and different reconditioning protocols.,"Deep vein thrombosis is a major global health issue, responsible for thousands of deaths each year. While thrombi can form under a variety of circumstances, lack of mobility significantly increases risk and therefore non-ambulant patients are frequently fitted with anti-embolism stockings on admission to hospital, to aid blood flow, prevent pooling and thus clotting. Anti-embolism stockings are the most widely used non-invasive medical device on the market and are believed to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis by 40%. Despite their widespread use in hospitals world-wide, there is remarkably little research addressing their use or reconditioning and a wide variety of different reconditioning protocols are used in hospitals.--NEW SECTION--The objective of this study was to establish the impact of different wear and reconditioning protocols on the pressure delivering ability of anti-embolism stockings.--NEW SECTION--A laboratory investigation was undertaken to evaluate the pressure delivering ability of 2 major global brands of anti-embolism stockings over 5-8days of simulated wear (extension on static cylinders) and 4 different reconditioning protocols. 1 set of samples was continuously 'worn' for 8days without reconditioning, 1 set of samples was 'worn' for 5days with a day of relaxation between each day of 'wear', 1 set was 'hand washed' and 1 set was machine washed and then allowed to relax between each day of 'wear'. The pressure was measured at the beginning and end of each period of 'wear'.--NEW SECTION--This study was undertaken in a conditioned textile testing laboratory that complies with BS EN ISO 139:2005+A1:2011.--NEW SECTION--The pressure exerted by anti-embolism stockings reduced by between 15 and 24% after 24h of wear, it reduced by between 21 and 32% when worn continuously for 8days. Allowing stockings to rest for a day between days of wear allowed them to recover slightly but this recovery was only temporary. Washing stockings regenerated their pressure delivering potential significantly and machine washing allowed some to recover to exert more pressure than they had when new.--NEW SECTION--Different brands of anti-embolism stockings exert different pressures on the same size of leg, when correctly fitted. The pressure exerted by anti-embolism stockings decreases with use but the correct pressure gradient is maintained if correctly fitted. Washing stockings after 24h of wear is effective in restoring their pressure delivering abilities and in some cases can surpass their 'as new' pressure delivering ability.",eng,International journal of nursing studies,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Global health agencies, leaders, and funders are prioritizing strategies that focus on acquiring high quality health data. Electronic maternal and child health registries (eRegistries) offer a systematic data collection and management approach that can serve as an entry point for preventive, curative and promotive health services. Due to the highly sensitive nature of reproductive health information, careful consideration must be accorded to privacy, access, and data security. In the third paper of the eRegistries Series, we report on the current landscape of ethical and legal governance for maternal and child health registries in developing countries.--NEW SECTION--This research utilizes findings from two web-based surveys, completed in 2015 that targeted public health officials and health care providers in 76 countries with high global maternal and child mortality burden. A sample of 298 public health officials from 64 countries and 490 health care providers from 59 countries completed the online survey. Based on formative research in the development of the eRegistries Governance Guidance Toolkit, the surveys were designed to investigate topics related to maternal and child health registries including ethical and legal issues.--NEW SECTION--According to survey respondents, the prevailing legal landscape is characterized by inadequate data security safeguards and weak support for core privacy principles. Respondents from the majority of countries indicated that health information from medical records is typically protected by legislation although legislation dealing specifically or comprehensively with data privacy may not be in place. Health care provider trust in the privacy of health data at their own facilities is associated with the presence of security safeguards.--NEW SECTION--Addressing legal requirements and ensuring that privacy and data security of women's and children's health information is protected is an ethical responsibility that must not be ignored or postponed, particularly where the need is greatest.

The research aims to summarize the findings of studies that monitor and evaluate the DoD's response to the Ebola pandemic or compare the effectiveness of different DoD response activities; it further aims to identify common themes around positive and negative lessons learned and recommendations that can be applied to future DoD humanitarian assistance and disaster response efforts. The search included documents and observations from PubMed, Disaster Lit: Resource Guide for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, the Joint Lessons Learned Information System, the DoD and US Africa Command websites, and Google Scholar. The records selected from the search were analyzed to provide insights on the DoD's humanitarian assistance and disaster response engagements that could be employed to inform future operations and policy. Furthermore, the research identifies strengths and gaps in military capabilities to respond to disasters, which can be used to inform future training and education courses. Overall, the findings demonstrate the importance of monitoring, evaluating, and assessing disaster response activities and provide new evidence to support the implementation of activities, in accordance with the Global Health Security Agenda, to strengthen all-threat prevention, detection, and response capabilities worldwide.",eng,Health security,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Subjects completed a structured questionnaire containing the Woman Abuse Screening tool, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the 10-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF).--NEW SECTION--Analysis by independent t test suggested that victims of dating violence had more severe depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms and poorer HRQOL than non-victims. Multiple linear regression models found that more severe dating violence victimization was associated with more severe depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms. The mediation analysis found that after simultaneously controlling for the degree of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms, the direct effect between dating violence severity and HRQOL, as measured by overall HRQOL and the global health, physical and environment domains of the WHOQOL-BREF, was statistically insignificant, supporting a full-mediation model. The relationship between dating violence severity and the social domain of HRQOL was partially mediated by the degree of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms.--NEW SECTION--Victims of dating violence had poorer mental health and HRQOL than non-victims. The study findings affirm the importance of assessing depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms in victims and the need to improve their depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms to diminish the negative effects of dating violence, which are apparent in their HRQOL.",eng,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Considering the impaired immunity of CKD patients, the relevance of infection in peritoneal dialysis (PD), and the increased prevalence of parasites in CKD patients, protozoa colonization was evaluated in PD effluent from CKD patients undergoing PD. Overnight PD effluent was obtained from 49 asymptomatic stable PD patients. Protozoa analysis was performed microscopically by searching cysts and trophozoites in direct wet mount of PD effluent and after staining smears. Protozoa were found in PD effluent of 10.2% of evaluated PD patients, namely Blastocystis hominis, in 2 patients, and Entamoeba sp., Giardia sp., and Endolimax nana in the other 3 patients, respectively. None of these patients presented clinical signs or symptoms of peritonitis at the time of protozoa screening.

27659604,10.1186/s12859-016-1247-7,Automatic classification of registered clinical trials towards the Global Burden of Diseases taxonomy of diseases and injuries.,"Clinical trial registries may allow for producing a global mapping of health research. However, health conditions are not described with standardized taxonomies in registries. Previous work analyzed clinical trial registries to improve the retrieval of relevant clinical trials for patients. However, no previous work has classified clinical trials across diseases using a standardized taxonomy allowing a comparison between global health research and global burden across diseases. We developed a knowledge-based classifier of health conditions studied in registered clinical trials towards categories of diseases and injuries from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2010 study. The classifier relies on the UMLS® knowledge source (Unified Medical Language System®) and on heuristic algorithms for parsing data. It maps trial records to a 28-class grouping of the GBD categories by automatically extracting UMLS concepts from text fields and by projecting concepts between medical terminologies. The classifier allows deriving pathways between the clinical trial record and candidate GBD categories using natural language processing and links between knowledge sources, and selects the relevant GBD classification based on rules of prioritization across the pathways found. We compared automatic and manual classifications for an external test set of 2,763 trials. We automatically classified 109,603 interventional trials registered before February 2014 at WHO ICTRP.--NEW SECTION--In the external test set, the classifier identified the exact GBD categories for 78 % of the trials. It had very good performance for most of the 28 categories, especially ""Neoplasms"" (sensitivity 97.4 %, specificity 97.5 %). The sensitivity was moderate for trials not relevant to any GBD category (53 %) and low for trials of injuries (16 %). For the 109,603 trials registered at WHO ICTRP, the classifier did not assign any GBD category to 20.5 % of trials while the most common GBD categories were ""Neoplasms"" (22.8 %) and ""Diabetes"" (8.9 %).--NEW SECTION--We developed and validated a knowledge-based classifier allowing for automatically identifying the diseases studied in registered trials by using the taxonomy from the GBD 2010 study.

Although some studies suggested that a negative view of cancer may increase the level of depression, such an association has never been studied in the elderly population. Similarly, even though it is established that a negative self-perception of aging has deleterious consequences on mental and physical health in normal aging, the influence in pathological contexts, such as oncology, has not been studied. The main aim of this study is thus to analyze the effect of these two stigmas on the health of elderly oncology patients.--NEW SECTION--101 patients suffering from a cancer (breast, gynecological, lung or hematological) were seen as soon as possible after their diagnosis. Their self-perception of age, cancer view and health (physical and mental) was assessed.--NEW SECTION--Multiple regressions showed that patients with a more negative self-perception of aging and/or more negative cancer view reported poorer global health. We also observed that negative self-perception of aging was associated with worse physical and mental health, whereas negative cancer views were only linked to worse mental health. No interaction was observed between these two stigmas, suggesting that their action is independent.--NEW SECTION--Older patients with cancer face double stigmatization, due to negative self-perception of aging and cancer, and these stigmas have impacts on global and mental health. Self-perception of aging is also linked to physical health. Longitudinal studies will be necessary to analyze the direction of the association between this double stigmatization and health.",eng,Journal of geriatric oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Evidence for standard treatment of skin infections predominantly stem from hospital-based studies in high-income countries. The evidence for treatment in resource-limited settings is less clear, as studies in these populations may lack randomisation and control groups for cultural, ethical or economic reasons. Likewise, a synthesis of the evidence for public health control within endemic populations is also lacking. We propose a systematic review of the evidence for the prevention, treatment and public health management of skin infections in resource-limited settings, to inform the development of guidelines for the standardised and streamlined clinical and public health management of skin infections in endemic populations.--NEW SECTION--The protocol has been designed in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement. All trial designs and analytical observational study designs will be eligible for inclusion. A systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature will include PubMed, Excertpa Medica and Global Health. Grey literature databases will also be systematically searched, and clinical trials registries scanned for future relevant studies. The primary outcome of interest will be the clinical cure or decrease in prevalence of impetigo, scabies, crusted scabies, tinea capitis, tinea corporis or tinea unguium.

27658857,10.1186/s12931-016-0434-4,The genetic and epigenetic landscapes of the epithelium in asthma.,"Asthma is a global health problem with increasing prevalence. The airway epithelium is the initial barrier against inhaled noxious agents or aeroallergens. In asthma, the airway epithelium suffers from structural and functional abnormalities and as such, is more susceptible to normally innocuous environmental stimuli. The epithelial structural and functional impairments are now recognised as a significant contributing factor to asthma pathogenesis. Both genetic and environmental risk factors play important roles in the development of asthma with an increasing number of genes associated with asthma susceptibility being expressed in airway epithelium. Epigenetic factors that regulate airway epithelial structure and function are also an attractive area for assessment of susceptibility to asthma. In this review we provide a comprehensive discussion on genetic factors; from using linkage designs and candidate gene association studies to genome-wide association studies and whole genome sequencing, and epigenetic factors; DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs (especially microRNAs), in airway epithelial cells that are functionally associated with asthma pathogenesis. Our aims were to introduce potential predictors or therapeutic targets for asthma in airway epithelium. Overall, we found very small overlap in asthma susceptibility genes identified with different technologies. Some potential biomarkers are IRAKM, PCDH1, ORMDL3/GSDMB, IL-33, CDHR3 and CST1 in airway epithelial cells. Recent studies on epigenetic regulatory factors have further provided novel insights to the field, particularly their effect on regulation of some of the asthma susceptibility genes (e.g. methylation of ADAM33). Among the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, microRNA networks have been shown to regulate a major portion of post-transcriptional gene regulation. Particularly, miR-19a may have some therapeutic potential.",eng,Respiratory research,Review,2025-04-23,2016

Iron is an essential functional component of erythrocyte hemoglobin and its availability is controlled by the liver-derived hormone hepcidin. We examined the regulation of hepcidin during malarial infection in mice using the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei K173. Mice infected with Plasmodium berghei K173 develop a severe anemia and die after 18 to 22 days without cerebral malaria. During the early phase of blood-stage infection (days 1 to 5), a strong inflammatory signature was associated with an increased production of hepcidin. Between days 7 and 18, while infection progressed, red blood cell count, hemoglobin and hematocrit dramatically decreased. In the late phase of malarial infection, hepcidin production was reduced concomitantly to an increase in the messenger RNA expression of the hepcidin suppressor erythroferrone in the bone marrow and the spleen. Compared with wild-type mice, Erfe-/- mice failed to adequately suppress hepcidin expression after infection with Plasmodium berghei K173. Importantly, the sustained production of hepcidin allowed by erythroferrone ablation was associated with decreased parasitemia, providing further evidence that transient iron restriction could be beneficial in the treatment of malaria.",eng,Haematologica,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

To be included, studies must have exposed people to an inert substance and have assessed 1 or more baseline or experimental factor(s) on its ability to predict symptom development in response to the inert exposure.--NEW SECTION--Eighty-nine studies were included; 70 used an experimental design and 19 used a prospective design, identifying 14 different categories of risk factor. The strongest predictors of nocebo effects were a higher perceived dose of exposure, explicit suggestions that the exposure triggers arousal or symptoms, observing people experiencing symptoms from the exposure, and higher expectations of symptoms.--NEW SECTION--To reduce nocebo induced symptoms associated with medication or other interventions clinicians could reduce expectations of symptoms, limit suggestions of symptoms, correct unrealistic dose perceptions, and reduce exposure to people experiencing side effects. There is some evidence that we should do this especially for persons with at-risk personality types, though exactly which personality types these are requires further research. These suggestions have a downside in terms of consent and paternalism, but there is scope to develop innovative ways to reduce nocebo effects without withholding information.

Intriguingly, infections with low or undetected blood parasites are common, particularly in the case of Human African Trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. We hypothesise, therefore, the skin represents an anatomic reservoir of infection. Here we definitively show that substantial quantities of trypanosomes exist within the skin following experimental infection, which can be transmitted to the tsetse vector, even in the absence of detectable parasitaemia. Importantly, we demonstrate the presence of extravascular parasites in human skin biopsies from undiagnosed individuals. The identification of this novel reservoir requires a re-evaluation of current diagnostic methods and control policies.

As an estimated 55 % of surgical care delivered in some LMICs is via charitable organizations; the financial contributions of this sector provides valuable insight into understanding financing priorities in global surgery.--NEW SECTION--Databases of registered charitable organizations in five high-income nations (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) were searched to identify organizations committed exclusively to surgery in LMICs and their financial data. For each organization, we categorized the surgical specialty and calculated revenues and expenditures. All foreign currency was converted to U.S. dollars based on historical yearly average conversion rates. All dollars were adjusted for inflation by converting to 2014 U.S. dollars.--NEW SECTION--One hundred sixty organizations representing 15 specialties were identified. Adjusting for inflation, in 2014 U.S. dollars (US$), total aggregated revenue over the years 2008-2013 was $3·4 billion and total aggregated expenses were $3·1 billion. Twenty-eight ophthalmology organizations accounted for 45 % of revenue and 49 % of expenses. Fifteen cleft lip/palate organizations totaled 26 % of both revenue and expenses. The remaining 117 organizations, representing a variety of specialties, accounted for 29 % of revenue and 25 % of expenses. In comparison, from 2008 to 2013, charitable organizations provided nearly $27 billion for global health, meaning an estimated 11.5 % went towards surgery.--NEW SECTION--Charitable organizations that exclusively provide surgery in LMICs primarily focus on elective surgeries, which cover many subspecialties, and often fill deep gaps in care. The largest funding flows are directed at ophthalmology, followed by cleft lip and palate surgery. Despite the number of contributing organizations, there is a clear need for improvement and increased transparency in tracking of funds to global surgery via charitable organizations.",eng,SpringerPlus,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27651828,10.1186/s13031-016-0096-3,The peacebuilding potential of healthcare training programs.,"Global health professionals regularly conduct healthcare trainings, such as first aid courses, in disadvantaged communities across the world. Many of these communities lack healthcare infrastructure because of war and political conflict. The authors draw on their experience conducting a first aid course in South Sudan to provide a perspective on how healthcare trainings for people with no medical background can be used to bridge ethnic, political, and religious differences. They argue that a necessary step for turning a healthcare training into a vehicle for peacebuilding is to bring people from different communities to the same physical space to learn the course material together. Importantly, simply encouraging contact between communities is unlikely to improve intergroup relations and could be detrimental if the following features are not incorporated. Buy-in from respected community leaders is essential to ensure that training participants trust that their safety during the training sessions is not at risk. Trainers should also create a supportive environment by conferring equal status and respect on all trainees. Finally, hands-on training exercises allow for positive interactions between trainees from different groups, which in turn can challenge stereotypes and facilitate cross-group friendships. These features map onto social psychological principles that have been shown to improve intergroup relations and are consistent with lessons learned from peace through health initiatives in public health and medicine. By adopting peacebuilding features, healthcare trainings can serve their primary goal of medical education and provide the added benefit of strengthening social relations.",eng,Conflict and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27651361,10.1128/mBio.01516-16,Tuberculosis Susceptibility and Vaccine Protection Are Independently Controlled by Host Genotype.,"The outcome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and the immunological response to the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine are highly variable in humans. Deciphering the relative importance of host genetics, environment, and vaccine preparation for the efficacy of BCG has proven difficult in natural populations. We developed a model system that captures the breadth of immunological responses observed in outbred individual mice, which can be used to understand the contribution of host genetics to vaccine efficacy. This system employs a panel of highly diverse inbred mouse strains, consisting of the founders and recombinant progeny of the ""Collaborative Cross"" project. Unlike natural populations, the structure of this panel allows the serial evaluation of genetically identical individuals and the quantification of genotype-specific effects of interventions such as vaccination. When analyzed in the aggregate, our panel resembled natural populations in several important respects: the animals displayed a broad range of susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, differed in their immunological responses to infection, and were not durably protected by BCG vaccination. However, when analyzed at the genotype level, we found that these phenotypic differences were heritable. M. tuberculosis susceptibility varied between lines, from extreme sensitivity to progressive M. tuberculosis clearance. Similarly, only a minority of the genotypes was protected by vaccination. The efficacy of BCG was genetically separable from susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, and the lack of efficacy in the aggregate analysis was driven by nonresponsive lines that mounted a qualitatively distinct response to infection. These observations support an important role for host genetic diversity in determining BCG efficacy and provide a new resource to rationally develop more broadly efficacious vaccines.--NEW SECTION--Tuberculosis (TB) remains an urgent global health crisis, and the efficacy of the currently used TB vaccine, M. bovis BCG, is highly variable. The design of more broadly efficacious vaccines depends on understanding the factors that limit the protection imparted by BCG. While these complex factors are difficult to disentangle in natural populations, we used a model population of mice to understand the role of host genetic composition in BCG efficacy. We found that the ability of BCG to protect mice with different genotypes was remarkably variable. The efficacy of BCG did not depend on the intrinsic susceptibility of the animal but, instead, correlated with qualitative differences in the immune responses to the pathogen. These studies suggest that host genetic polymorphism is a critical determinant of vaccine efficacy and provide a model system to develop interventions that will be useful in genetically diverse populations.",eng,mBio,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27650306,10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b03409,Near-Atomic Three-Dimensional Mapping for Site-Specific Chemistry of 'Superbugs'.,"Emergence of multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria has caused a global health crisis and last-line class of antibiotics such as polymyxins are increasingly used. The chemical composition at the cell surface plays a key role in antibiotic resistance. Unlike imaging the cellular ultrastructure with well-developed electron microscopy, the acquisition of a high-resolution chemical map of the bacterial surface still remains a technological challenge. In this study, we developed an atom probe tomography (APT) analysis approach to acquire mass spectra in the pulsed-voltage mode and reconstructed the 3D chemical distribution of atoms and molecules in the subcellular domain at the near-atomic scale. Using focused ion beam (FIB) milling together with micromanipulation, site-specific samples were retrieved from a single cell of Acinetobacter baumannii prepared as needle-shaped tips with end radii less than 60 nm, followed by a nanoscale coating of silver in the order of 10 nm. The significantly elevated conductivity provided by the metallic coating enabled successful and routine field evaporation of the biological material, with all the benefits of pulsed-voltage APT. In parallel with conventional cryo-TEM imaging, our novel approach was applied to investigate polymyxin-susceptible and -resistant strains of A. baumannii after treatment of polymyxin B. Acquired atom probe mass spectra from the cell envelope revealed characteristic fragments of phosphocholine from the polymyxin-susceptible strain, but limited signals from this molecule were detected in the polymyxin-resistant strain. This study promises unprecedented capacity for 3D nanoscale imaging and chemical mapping of bacterial cells at the ultimate 3D spatial resolution using APT.",eng,Nano letters,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The aim of this study was to estimate HrQOL normative values for the EQ-5D-5L preference-based measure in a large, randomly selected, community sample in South Australia.--NEW SECTION--The EQ-5D-5L instrument was included in the 2013 South Australian Health Omnibus Survey, an interviewer-administered, face-to-face, cross-sectional survey. Respondents rated their level of impairment across dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and global health rating on a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). Utility scores were derived using the newly-developed UK general population-based algorithm and relationships between utility and EQ-VAS scores and socio-demographic factors were also explored using multivariate regression analyses.--NEW SECTION--Ultimately, 2,908 adults participated in the survey (63.4 % participation rate). The mean utility and EQ-VAS scores were 0.91 (95 CI 0.90, 0.91) and 78.55 (95 % CI 77.95, 79.15), respectively. Almost half of respondents reported no problems across all dimensions (42.8 %), whereas only 7.2 % rated their health >90 on the EQ-VAS (100 = the best health you can imagine). Younger age, male gender, longer duration of education, higher annual household income, employment and marriage/de facto relationships were all independent, statistically significant predictors of better health status (p < 0.01) measured with the EQ-VAS. Only age and employment status were associated with higher utility scores, indicating fundamental differences between these measures of health status.--NEW SECTION--This is the first Australian study to apply the EQ-5D-5L in a large, community sample. Overall, findings are consistent with EQ-5D-5L utility and VAS scores reported for other countries and indicate that the majority of South Australian adults report themselves in full health. When valuing health in Australian economic evaluations, the utility population norms can be used to estimate HrQOL. More generally, the EQ-VAS score may be a better measure of population health given the smaller ceiling effect and broader coverage of HrQOL dimensions. Further research is recommended to update EQ-5D-5L population norms using the Australian general population specific scoring algorithm once this becomes publically available.",eng,Health and quality of life outcomes,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016

Mental healthcare services integration in primary care settings is a key intervention to address this gap. A common strategy includes embedding mental healthcare workers on-site, and receiving consultation from an off-site psychiatrist. Primary care provider perspectives are important for successful program implementation.--NEW SECTION--We conducted three focus groups with all 24 primary care providers at a district-level hospital in rural Nepal. We asked participants about their concerns and recommendations for an integrated mental healthcare delivery program. They were also asked about current practices in seeking referral for patients with mental illness. We collected data using structured notes and analyzed the data by template coding to develop themes around concerns and recommendations for an integrated program.--NEW SECTION--Participants noted that the current referral system included sending patients to the nearest psychiatrist who is 14 h away. Participants did not think this was effective, and stated that integrating mental health into the existing primary care setting would be ideal. Their major concerns about a proposed program included workplace hierarchies between mental healthcare workers and other clinicians, impact of staff turnover on patients, reliability of an off-site consultant psychiatrist, and ability of on-site primary care providers to screen patients and follow recommendations from an off-site psychiatrist. Their suggestions included training a few existing primary care providers as dedicated mental healthcare workers, recruiting both senior and junior mental healthcare workers to ensure retention, recruiting academic psychiatrists for reliability, and training all primary care providers to appropriately screen for mental illness and follow recommendations from the psychiatrist.--NEW SECTION--Primary care providers in rural Nepal reported the failure of the current system of referral, which includes sending patients to a distant city. They welcomed integrating mental healthcare into the primary care system, and reported several concerns and recommendations to increase the likelihood of successful implementation of such a program.",eng,BMC health services research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, few programs in Africa prepare healthcare professionals with the leadership skills vital to the success of the healthcare systems in which they work. One such program, the Afya Bora Consortium Fellowship in Global Health Leadership, has been training health professionals since 2011. The purpose of this study was to assess what career changes, if any, the Afya Bora Fellowship's alumni have experienced since completing the fellowship, and to describe those changes.--NEW SECTION--The Afya Bora Fellowship is a multidisciplinary, one-year training program that teaches health professionals leadership skills through didactic and experiential learning in four African countries. Between January 2011 and June 2013 the consortium trained 42 nurses and doctors. In November 2013, an electronic survey was sent to all alumni to assess their performance in the workplace post-fellowship.--NEW SECTION--Thirty-one (74 %) of 42 alumni completed surveys. Twenty-one (68 %) reported changes to their position at work; of those, sixteen (76 %) believed the change was due to participation in the fellowship. All alumni reported improved performance at work, and cited the application of a wide range of fellowship skills, including leadership, research, communication, and mentoring. Twenty-six (84 %) alumni spearheaded improvements in their workplaces and almost all (97 %) remained in contact with colleagues from the fellowship. Among the respondents there were five publications, nine manuscripts in preparation, and three international conference presentations.--NEW SECTION--Afya Bora alumni overwhelmingly reported that the one year fellowship positively influenced both their work and career trajectory. Training health professionals in leadership skills through didactic modules with the opportunity to apply learned skills at attachment sites in the Afya Bora Fellowship has an impact on performance in the workplace and the potential to improve long-term institutional capacity.",eng,BMC medical education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We investigated the relationship between the aforementioned in glioma-patients to evaluate the association of these instruments and determine cut-off values for suitable HRQoL scales indicating a potential need for intervention. In an observational multi-center study, outpatients completed the Distress Thermometer (DT), EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30/BN20, HRQoL), and Supportive-Care-Needs-Survey-SF34-G (SCNS). Based on nine EORTC-function and selected -symptom scales items of the questionnaires were matched. Convergent validity of related single items and scores across the instruments was estimated. EORTC cut-off values were calculated. Data of 167 patients were analyzed. The strongest correlation of EORTC-QLQ-C30 and DT was found for cognitive function (cogf), global health status (GHS), emotional (emof), role function (rolef), future uncertainty (FU), fatigue, and between EORTC-QLQ-C30 and SCNS for FU, emof, rolef (r = |0.4-0.7|; p < 0.01). EORTC cut-off values of <54.2 (GHS/QoL) and <62.5 (emof) predicted a DT ≥ 6 (AUC 0.79, 0.85, p < 0.01). EORTC cut-off values of <70.8 (emof) and <52.8 (FU) predicted the need for supportive care (AUC 0.78, 0.85; p < 0.01). Worse EORTC-C30 scores correlate with higher DT and SCNS scores. With this exploratory assessment, cut-off values for EORTC-C30 subscores to predict distress and pathological SCNS-scores could be determined, which could influence patients' referral to further treatment. However, further prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm the clinical relevance of these cut-off values.",eng,Journal of neuro-oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Although new, highly effective and safe direct-acting antivirals have been approved for adults, the only drugs currently registered for children are pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The timelines for the pediatric approval of the new treatment regimens are far off. Three phase II-III pediatric trials with direct-acting antivirals are recruiting, and the estimated dates of completion of these studies range between April 2018 and January 2023.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of on-treatment virologic response (VR) as predictor of sustained virologic response (SVR) in a cohort of Italian children with chronic hepatitis C and to establish possible stopping rules.--NEW SECTION--Sixty-four children were enrolled (January 2012 to December 2015). SVR rate was 79.7% (51/64). VR at weeks 2 to 12 were shown to be robust predictors for the attainment of SVR. The positive predictive values of VR at weeks 8 and 12 were 98% and 92.7%, respectively. The negative predictive values at the same treatment weeks were 92.9% and 100%, indicating that no child who did not achieve VR at week 12 obtained SVR and that the likelihood of achieving SVR if still positive at week 8 was very low.--NEW SECTION--Our results suggest for the first time that VR at week 8 could be considered a reliable predictor of SVR.

Treatment of heart failure has also shown striking variations in recent years. Such is the case of the substitution of sympathomimetic drugs by beta-blocking agents, which primarily means a conceptual change in the pathophysiological interpretation of this syndrome. Incorporating to the treatment of heart failure drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers has meant a great step forward in the treatment of patients with this condition that significantly has decreased mortality and morbidity. The latest introduction of the drug identified as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (LCZ696), launched in August 2014 with an even greater reduction in mortality and morbidity of heart failure and fewer side effects, offers a valid hope in the treatment of this pathology.

To provide a cost-effective solution for comprehensive post-stroke rehabilitation that can alleviate the need for one-on-one physical or occupational therapy, in lower and upper extremities, we proposed and implemented a technology-assisted rehabilitation gymnasium in Chihuahua, Mexico. The Gymnasium for Robotic Rehabilitation (Robot Gym) consisted of low- and high-tech systems for upper and lower limb rehabilitation. Our hypothesis is that the Robot Gym can provide a cost- and labor-efficient alternative for post-stroke rehabilitation, while being more or as effective as traditional physical and occupational therapy approaches.--NEW SECTION--A typical group of stroke patients was randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 10) or a control group (n = 10). The intervention group received rehabilitation using the devices in the Robot Gym, whereas the control group (n = 10) received time-matched standard care. All of the study subjects were subjected to 24 two-hour therapy sessions over a period of 6 to 8 weeks. Several clinical assessments tests for upper and lower extremities were used to evaluate motor function pre- and post-intervention. A cost analysis was done to compare the cost effectiveness for both therapies.--NEW SECTION--No significant differences were observed when comparing the results of the pre-intervention Mini-mental, Brunnstrom Test, and Geriatric Depression Scale Test, showing that both groups were functionally similar prior to the intervention. Although, both training groups were functionally equivalent, they had a significant age difference. The results of all of the upper extremity tests showed an improvement in function in both groups with no statistically significant differences between the groups. The Fugl-Meyer and the 10 Meters Walk lower extremity tests showed greater improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group. On the Time Up and Go Test, no statistically significant differences were observed pre- and post-intervention when comparing the control and the intervention groups. For the 6 Minute Walk Test, both groups presented a statistically significant difference pre- and post-intervention, showing progress in their performance. The robot gym therapy was more cost-effective than the traditional one-to-one therapy used during this study in that it enabled therapist to train up to 1.5 to 6 times more patients for the approximately same cost in the long term.--NEW SECTION--The results of this study showed that the patients that received therapy using the Robot Gym had enhanced functionality in the upper extremity tests similar to patients in the control group. In the lower extremity tests, the intervention patients showed more improvement than those subjected to traditional therapy. These results support that the Robot Gym can be as effective as traditional therapy for stroke patients, presenting a more cost- and labor-efficient option for countries with scarce clinical resources and funding.--NEW SECTION--ISRCTN98578807 .",eng,Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016

Analysing how health-financing data explains improvements in RMNCH outcomes was one of the components to the case studies.--NEW SECTION--This paper presents a descriptive analysis on health financing from six Countdown case studies (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Malawi, Pakistan, Peru, and Tanzania), supplemented by additional data from global databases and country reports on macroeconomic, health financing, demographic, and RMNCH outcome data as needed. It also examines the effect of other contextual factors presented in the case studies to help interpret health-financing data.--NEW SECTION--Dramatic increases in health funding occurred since 2000, where the MDG agenda encouraged countries and donors to invest more resources on health. Most low-income countries relied on external support to increase health spending, with an average 20-64 % of total health spending from 2000 onwards. Middle-income countries relied more on government and household spending. RMNCH funding also increased since 2000, with an average increase of 119 % (2005-2010) for RMNH expenditures (2005-2010) and 165 % for CH expenditures (2005-2011). Progress was made, especially achieving MDG 4, even with low per capita spending; ranging from US$16 to US$44 per child under 5 years among low-income countries. Improvements in distal factors were noted during the time frame of the analysis, including rapid economic growth in Ethiopia, Peru, and Tanzania and improvements in female literacy as documented in Malawi, which are also likely to have contributed to MDG progress and achievements.--NEW SECTION--Increases in health and RMNCH funding accompanied improvements in outcomes, though low-income countries are still very reliant on external financing, and out-of-pocket comprising a growing share of funds in middle-income settings. Enhancements in tracking RMNCH expenditures across countries are still needed to better understand whether domestic and global health financing initiatives lead to improved outcomes as RMNCH continues to be a priority under the Sustainable Development Goals.",eng,BMC public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A cinnamaldehyde toxicity profile was established for embryonic and adult cells using a live cell imaging assay, immunocytochemistry, the comet assay and a recovery assay.--NEW SECTION--Twenty of the 39 refill fluids contained cinnamaldehyde at concentrations that are cytotoxic to human embryonic and lung cells in the MTT assay. Cinnamon Ceylon aerosol produced in a cartomizer-style e-cigarette was cytotoxic. Cinnamon Ceylon aerosols and refill fluid aerosols (80% propylene glycol or cinnamaldehyde/propylene glycol) made using a tank/boxmod e-cigarette were more cytotoxic at 5 V than 3 V. Using GC/MS, aerosols produced at 5 V contained 10 additional peaks not present in aerosol generated at 3 V. One of these, 2,3-butandione (diacetyl), was confirmed with an authentic standard. Cinnamaldehyde depolymerised microtubules in human pulmonary fibroblasts. At concentrations that produced no effect in the MTT assay, cinnamaldehyde decreased growth, attachment and spreading; altered cell morphology and motility; increased DNA strand breaks; and increased cell death.

This has led to a notable increase in the utilization of this telecommunication in healthcare, namely phone calls and text messaging (SMS). However, evaluating its global impact on improving healthcare processes and outcomes demands a more comprehensive assessment. In this study, we focused on the role of mobile devices via phone calls and SMS in patient-doctor communication, and aimed to assess its impact on various health outcomes. Methods Major databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, and Cochrane CENTRAL, were searched for clinical trials that investigated mobile-device technology in any facet of doctor-patient communication published between 1990 and April 2015. A meta-analysis was performed where appropriate. Results Sixty-two articles met our inclusion criteria. Of those, 23 articles investigated mobile appointment reminder technologies, 19 investigated medication adherence, 20 investigated disease-control interventions, and two investigated test-result reporting. Patients who received an appointment reminder were 10% less likely to miss an appointment (relative risk [RR] = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.15). Mobile interventions increased medication adherence by 22% (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.36). Ten of 20 studies examining disease control reported statistically significant reductions in clinically meaningful endpoints. The use of mobile-device interventions improved forced expiratory volume in one second and hemoglobin A1c percentage in meta-analyses. Conclusion The use of mobile-device technologies exerted modest improvements in communication and health outcomes. Further research is needed to determine the true effect of these technologies on doctor-patient communication.",eng,Journal of telemedicine and telecare,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

A qualitative study of users' experience of monitoring & evaluation systems in HIV interventions in western India.,"In global health initiatives, particularly in the context of private philanthropy and its 'business minded' approach, detailed programme data plays an increasing role in informing assessments, improvements, evaluations, and ultimately continuation or discontinuation of funds for individual programmes. The HIV/AIDS literature predominantly treats monitoring as unproblematic. However, the social science of audit and indicators emphasises the constitutive power of indicators, noting that their effects at a grassroots level are often at odds with the goals specified in policy. This paper investigates users' experiences of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems in the context of HIV interventions in western India. Six focus groups (totalling 51 participants) were held with employees of 6 different NGOs working for government or philanthropy-funded HIV interventions for sex workers in western India. Ten donor employees were interviewed. Thematic analysis was conducted. NGO employees described a major gap between what they considered their ""real work"" and the indicators used to monitor it. They could explain the official purposes of M&E systems in terms of programme improvement and financial accountability. More cynically, they valued M&E experience on their CVs and the rhetorical role of data in demonstrating their achievements. They believed that inappropriate and unethical means were being used to meet targets, including incentives and coercion, and criticised indicators for being misleading and inflexible. Donor employees valued the role of M&E in programme improvement, financial accountability, and professionalising NGO-donor relationships. However, they were suspicious that NGOs might be falsifying data, criticised the insensitivity of indicators, and complained that data were under-used. For its users, M& E appears an 'empty ritual', enacted because donors require it, but not put to local use. In this context, monitoring is constituted as an instrument of performance management rather than as a means of rational programme improvement.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Conventional antibiotic CDI therapy can result in treatment failure and recurrent infection. C. difficile produces biofilms which contribute to its virulence and impair antimicrobial activity. Some bacteriophages (phages) can penetrate biofilms and thus could be developed to either replace or supplement antibiotics. Here, we determined the impact of a previously optimized 4-phage cocktail on C. difficile ribotype 014/020 biofilms, and additionally as adjunct to vancomycin treatment in Galleria mellonella larva CDI model. The phages were applied before or after biofilm establishment in vitro, and the impact was analyzed according to turbidity, viability counts and topography as observed using scanning electron and confocal microscopy. The infectivity profiles and efficacies of orally administered phages and/or vancomycin were ascertained by monitoring colonization levels and larval survival rates. Phages prevented biofilm formation, and penetrated established biofilms. A single phage application reduced colonization causing extended longevity in the remedial treatment and prevented disease in the prophylaxis group. Multiple phage doses significantly improved the larval remedial regimen, and this treatment is comparable to vancomycin and the combined treatments. Taken together, our data suggest that the phages significantly reduce C. difficile biofilms, and prevent colonization in the G. mellonella model when used alone or in combination with vancomycin. The phages appear to be highly promising therapeutics in the targeted eradication of CDI and the use of these models has revealed that prophylactic use could be a propitious therapeutic option.",eng,Frontiers in microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Basic measures such as life expectancy and infant and under-five mortality remain divergent, with preventable deaths being unacceptably high, despite significant efforts to reduce these disparities. We examine the impact of empowerment, measured by Freedom House's ratings of country's political rights and civil liberties, while controlling for per capita gross domestic product, secondary school enrollment, and income inequality, on national health outcomes. Using data from 1970 to 2013 across 149 countries, our results suggest, quite strongly, that higher levels of empowerment have a significant positive association with life expectancy, particularly for females, and lower rates of infant and under-five mortality. Our results point to the need for efforts to stimulate economic growth be accompanied with reforms to increase the levels empowerment through increasing political rights and civil liberties.",eng,Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27630242,10.1128/JVI.01462-16,"Altered Glycosylation Patterns Increase Immunogenicity of a Subunit Hepatitis C Virus Vaccine, Inducing Neutralizing Antibodies Which Confer Protection in Mice.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem for which no vaccine is available. HCV has a highly heterogeneous RNA genome and can be classified into seven genotypes. Due to the high genetic and resultant antigenic variation among the genotypes, inducing antibodies capable of neutralizing most of the HCV genotypes by experimental vaccination has been challenging. Previous efforts focused on priming humoral immune responses with recombinant HCV envelope E2 protein produced in mammalian cells. Here, we report that a soluble form of HCV E2 (sE2) produced in insect cells possesses different glycosylation patterns and is more immunogenic, as evidenced by the induction of higher titers of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) harboring structural proteins from a diverse array of HCV genotypes. We affirm that continuous and discontinuous epitopes of well-characterized bNAbs are conserved, suggesting that sE2 produced in insect cells is properly folded. In a genetically humanized mouse model, active immunization with sE2 efficiently protected against challenge with a heterologous HCV genotype. These data not only demonstrate that sE2 is a promising HCV vaccine candidate, but also highlight the importance of glycosylation patterns in developing subunit viral vaccines.--NEW SECTION--A prophylactic vaccine with high efficacy and low cost is urgently needed for global control of HCV infection. Induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies against most HCV genotypes has been challenging due to the antigenic diversity of the HCV genome. Here, we refined a high-yield subunit HCV vaccine that elicited broadly neutralizing antibody responses in preclinical trials. We found that soluble HCV E2 protein (sE2) produced in insect cells is distinctly glycosylated and is more immunogenic than sE2 produced in mammalian cells, suggesting that glycosylation patterns should be taken into consideration in efforts to generate antibody-based recombinant vaccines against HCV. We further showed that sE2 vaccination confers protection against HCV infection in a genetically humanized mouse model. Thus, our work identified a promising broadly protective HCV vaccine candidate that should be considered for further preclinical and clinical development.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

These risks are derived from Asia; little is known about sub-Saharan Africa.--NEW SECTION--To determine the risk of mother-to-child transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, according to maternal HBeAg and type of prophylaxis.--NEW SECTION--We searched Medline, Global Health, Embase, African Journals Online and African Index Medicus. We included observational or interventional studies that enrolled infants of HBV-infected women, and that tested for HBsAg or HBV DNA between 3 and 12 months of age.--NEW SECTION--Fifteen articles from 11 African countries were included. Among HBeAg-positive women, the pooled risk was 38.3% (95% CI: 7.0-74.4%) without prophylaxis, which was significantly lower than the lower bound of 70-90% risk in the literature (P = 0.007). Among HBeAg-negative women, the pooled risk was 4.8% (95% CI: 0.1-13.3%) without prophylaxis, which lays within the lower range of the 5-30% risk in Asia. By extrapolating the pooled transmission risks to the number of births to infectious mothers, an estimated 1% of newborns (n = 367 250) are annually infected with HBV at birth in sub-Saharan Africa.--NEW SECTION--Compared to Asia, the risk of mother-to-child transmission is low in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the annual number of infants perinatally infected with HBV is twice the number of incident paediatric HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa (n = 190 000). This highlights the importance of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HBV in sub-Saharan Africa, which has been long neglected.",eng,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Contrary to the existing literature on the topic, it argues that the history of international anti-smoking efforts is longer and richer than the making of the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in the early twenty-first century. It thereby echoes the point made by other scholars about the importance of history when making sense of contemporary global health. Specifically, the article shows how the internationalisation of tobacco control started in the 1950s through informal contacts between scientists working on cancer research and how these initial interactions were followed by a growing number of more formal initiatives, from the World Conferences on Tobacco or Health to the Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use. Rather than arranging these efforts in a linear narrative of progress culminating with the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, we take anthropological claims about global health's uneven terrain seriously and portray a history of international tobacco control marked by ruptures and discontinuities. Specifically, we identify three successive periods, with each of them characterised by specific understandings of international action, tobacco control expertise, advocacy networks and funding strategies.",eng,Medical history,Historical Article,2025-04-23,2016
27627882,10.1186/s12992-016-0190-8,ReRouting biomedical innovation: observations from a mapping of the alternative research and development (R&D) landscape.,"In recent years, the world has witnessed the tragic outcomes of multiple global health crises. From Ebola to high prices to antibiotic resistance, these events highlight the fundamental constraints of the current biomedical research and development (R&D) system in responding to patient needs globally.To mitigate this lack of responsiveness, over 100 self-identified ""alternative"" R&D initiatives, have emerged in the past 15 years. To begin to make sense of this panoply of initiatives working to overcome the constraints of the current system, UAEM began an extensive, though not comprehensive, mapping of the alternative biomedical R&D landscape. We developed a two phase approach: (1) an investigation, via the RE:Route Mapping, of both existing and proposed initiatives that claim to offer an alternative approach to R&D, and (2) evaluation of those initiatives to determine which are in fact achieving increased access to and innovation in medicines. Through phase 1, the RE:Route Mapping, we examined 81 initiatives that claim to redress the inequity perpetuated by the current system via one of five commonly recognized mechanisms necessary for truly alternative R&D.Preliminary analysis of phase 1 provides the following conclusions: 1. No initiative presents a completely alternative model of biomedical R&D. 2. The majority of initiatives focus on developing incentives for drug discovery. 3. The majority of initiatives focus on rare diseases or diseases of the poor and marginalized. 4. There is an increasing emphasis on the use of push, pull, pool, collaboration and open mechanisms alongside the concept of delinkage in alternative R&D. 5. There is a trend towards public funding and launching of initiatives by the Global South. Given the RE:Route Mapping's inevitable limitations and the assumptions made in its methodology, it is not intended to be the final word on a constantly evolving and complex field; however, its findings are significant. The Mapping's value lies in its timely and unique insight into the importance of ongoing efforts to develop a new global framework for biomedical R&D. As we progress to phase 2, an evaluation tool for initiatives focused on identifying which approaches have truly achieved increased innovation and access for patients, we aim to demonstrate that there are a handful of initiatives which represent some, but not all, of the building blocks for a new approach to R&D.Through this mapping and our forthcoming evaluation, UAEM aims to initiate an evidence-based conversation around a truly alternative biomedical R&D model that serves people rather than profits.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

It is thus important to determine their prevalence and spectrum and identify risk factors associated with the development of heart defects.--NEW SECTION--A case-control study was carried out in the Department of Pediatrics and Center of Cardiology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India, from February 2014 to August 2015. All patients referred with complaints or clinical examination suggestive of CHDs were further evaluated with echocardiography. On Echocardiography, patients having CHDs were included as cases and those having a normal echocardiographic study were included as controls. Healthy controls were also included. 400 cases and 400 controls were thus identified; preterms having patent ductus arteriosus and patent foramen ovale and those with acquired heart defects were excluded. Risk factors among cases and controls were further studied.--NEW SECTION--Acyanotic heart defects were 290 (72.50%) of the total heart defects, whereas the contribution of cyanotic heart defects was 110 (27.50%). Out of all CHDs, ventricular septal defect was the most common lesion with contribution of 152 (38%) cases, whereas among the cyanotic heart defects, Tetralogy of Fallot was the most common lesion (18% of total cases). Out of the total 400 cases, 261 were males (65.25%). On univariate analysis, paternal age (odds ratio, OR, 2.01), bad obstetric history (OR, 2.65), antenatal febrile illness (OR, 4.12), and advanced maternal age (OR, 3.28) were found to increase the risk of CHD whereas intake of multivitamin (OR, 3.02) was found to be protective. The risk factors were further analyzed with multivariate logistic regression analysis and all the above factors were found to be significantly associated.--NEW SECTION--We noted that the profile of CHD in our population was similar to the published literature although many were missed during infancy and detected later in life. Several antenatal factors were found to be associated with the incidence of congenital heart disease emphasizing the need to prioritize antenatal care and counseling to pregnant mothers along with good maternal nutrition and folic acid supplementation.",eng,Annals of pediatric cardiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Increased toxicity was observed with the addition of oxaliplatin, with grade 3/4 adverse events occurring in 63% of patients who received mFOLFOX6 and 11% of those who received FU/LV. More patients in the mFOLFOX6 arm withdrew from study due to adverse events than in the FU/LV arm (20% v 2%), whereas the use of postprogression therapy was significantly higher in the FU/LV arm (25% v 7%; P = .015). No significant differences were observed in time to deterioration on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 global health scale. Conclusion No benefit was observed with the addition of oxaliplatin, administered as mFOLFOX6, versus infusional FU/LV in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer previously treated with first-line gemcitabine.",eng,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,"Clinical Trial, Phase III",2025-04-23,2016

There is considerable evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of HFS on satisfaction and learning outcomes within undergraduate nursing programs; however, there are few studies that have investigated its use and effectiveness within nurse practitioner (NP) programs.--NEW SECTION--To synthesize the best available evidence about the effectiveness of HFS within NP education programs worldwide. The specific review question was: what is the effect of HFS on learner satisfaction, knowledge, attitudes, and skill performance in NP education?--NEW SECTION--Joanna Briggs Institute systematic review methodology was utilized. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, PROSPERO, HealthSTAR, AMED, Cochrane, Global Health and PsycINFO. Studies were included if they were quantitative in nature and reported on any aspect HFS within a NP program.--NEW SECTION--Ten studies were included in the review. All studies were conducted in the United States and published between 2007 and 2014. Outcomes explored included: knowledge, attitudes, skills and satisfaction. The majority of studies compared HFS to online learning or traditional classroom lecture. Most study scenarios featured high acuity, low frequency events within acute care settings; only two studies utilized scenarios simulated within primary care.--NEW SECTION--There is limited evidence supporting the use of HFS within NP programs. In general, HFS increases students' knowledge and confidence, and students are more satisfied with simulation-based teaching in comparison to other methods. Future studies should explore the effectiveness of simulation training within NP programs in reducing the theory to practice gap, and evaluate knowledge retention, transferability to real patient situations, and impact of simulation on patient outcomes.",eng,Nurse education today,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Lack of water availability at hospitals hinders safe surgical care. We aimed to review the surgical capacity literature and document the availability of water at health facilities and develop a predictive model of water availability at health facilities globally to inform targeted capacity improvements.--NEW SECTION--Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic search for surgical capacity assessments in LMICs in MEDLINE, PubMed, and World Health Organization Global Health Library was performed. Data regarding water availability were extracted. Data from these assessments and national indicator data from the World Bank (e.g., gross domestic product, total health expenditure, and percent of population with improved access to water) were used to create a predictive model for water availability in LMICs globally.--NEW SECTION--Of the 72 records identified, 19 reported water availability representing 430 hospitals. A total of 66% of hospitals assessed had water availability (283 of 430 hospitals). Using these data, estimated percent of water availability in LMICs more broadly ranged from under 20% (Liberia) to over 90% (Bangladesh, Ghana).--NEW SECTION--Less than two-thirds of hospitals providing surgical care in 19 LMICs had a reliable water source. Governments and nongovernmental organizations should increase efforts to improve water infrastructure at hospitals, which might aid in the provision of safe essential surgical care.

However, their impact on global development is questionable, particularly when volunteer skills are not matched to local needs, or when teams operate outside the local health system. Furthermore, the impact of these volunteer programs is rarely evaluated. Theory of Change is a framework for program design meant to facilitate measurable social change.

27620722,10.1128/IAI.00180-16,Critical Role for Interleukin-25 in Host Protective Th2 Memory Response against Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri.,"Infection with parasitic nematodes, especially gastrointestinal geohelminths, affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide and thus poses a major risk to global health. The host mechanism of defense against enteric nematode infection remains to be fully understood, but it involves a polarized type 2 immunity leading to alterations in intestinal function that facilitate worm expulsion. We investigated the role of interleukin-25 (IL-25) in host protection against Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri infection in mice. Our results showed that Il25 and its receptor subunit, Il17rb, were upregulated during a primary infection and a secondary challenge infection with H. polygyrus bakeri Genetic deletion of IL-25 (IL-25-/-) led to an attenuated type 2 cytokine response and increased worm fecundity in mice with a primary H. polygyrus bakeri infection. In addition, the full spectrum of the host memory response against a secondary infection with H. polygyrus bakeri was severely impaired in IL-25-/- mice, including delayed type 2 cytokine responses, an attenuated functional response of the intestinal smooth muscle and epithelium, diminished intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia, and impaired worm expulsion. Furthermore, exogenous administration of IL-25 restored the host protective memory response against H. polygyrus bakeri infection in IL-25-/- mice. These data demonstrate that IL-25 is critical for host protective immunity against H. polygyrus bakeri infection, highlighting its potential application as a therapeutic agent against parasitic nematode infection worldwide.",eng,Infection and immunity,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We conducted a field experiment in Zambia to assess the elasticity of demand for checkups as well as the associated health benefits. We find that relatively small incentives induce substantial increases in uptake among non-farming households and households living farther away from clinics, but not among households in the top wealth quintile. These results suggest that small financial incentives may be an efficient way to target poor populations. However, given the weak socioeconomic gradient in infections observed, small incentives will miss a substantial fraction of exposed children.

However, little research has focused to date on the nature, facilitators and barriers of these partnerships.--NEW SECTION--In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 17 participants from five different NGOs and their collaboration with state partners in the Ghanaian health sector at the national and local levels in four regions of the country (Northern, Upper East, Greater Accra, and Eastern) to explore the drivers and nature of these partnerships and their advantages and disadvantages in the effort to improve the public's health.--NEW SECTION--Major findings reveal that: 1) each collaboration between civil society organisations (CSOs) and the state in the health sector demands different partnerships; 2) partnership types can range from equal, formal contractual, decentralized to advocacy ones; 3) commitment by the state and NGOs to work in collaboration lead to improved service delivery, reduced health inequities and disparities; 4) added value of NGOs lies in their knowledge, expertise, community legitimacy, ability to attract donor funding and implementation capacity to address health needs in geographical areas or communities where the government does not reach and for services, which it does not provide and 5) success factors and challenges to be considered, moving forward to promote such partnerships in other LMICs.--NEW SECTION--Recommendations are offered for NGOs, governments, donors, and future research including studying the organisational effectiveness and sustainability of these partnerships to deliver effective and efficient health outcomes to recommend universal best practices in health care.",eng,BMC public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
30524794,10.5696/2156-9614-6-11.18,Association of Low Birthweight and Indoor Air Pollution: Biomass Fuel Use in Bangladesh.,"More than 90% of all low birthweight (LBW) babies are born in developing countries, and half of the population in developing nations uses solid fuels as their primary source of energy for cooking. An association between household use of solid biomass fuels and reduced newborn weight has been found in a number of countries. Bangladesh has a high prevalence of LBW babies (22%), and 88% of the population use solid fuels for cooking.--NEW SECTION--This study aims to explore whether indoor air pollution is associated with LBW in Bangladesh, an important determinant of infant mortality and morbidity.--NEW SECTION--The 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) was used for the present analysis. The total number of births reported in the previous five years by respondents in the survey sample was 8,753. Mothers' recall of their baby's weight was the dependent dichotomous variable. A mixed effects logistic regression model was fitted using region as a random effect and several independent fixed effects.--NEW SECTION--High pollutant cooking fuels, such as coal and wood, resulted in higher odds of having a LBW child compared to use of electricity/gas (odds ratio (OR): 2.6, confidence interval (CI): 1.1-6.2 and OR: 1.1, CI: 1.0-1.2). Factors which lowered the odds include mothers with a bachelor's degree or higher education (OR: 0.6, CI: 0.4-0.9), third order children (OR: 0.8, CI: 0.6-0.9), fourth or higher order children (OR: 0.8, CI: 0.6-1.0), having a male child (OR: 0.7, CI: 0.7-0.8), and receiving sufficient antenatal care (OR: 0.8, CI: 0.6-0.9). Factors which increase the odds of having a LBW infant include mothers who are underweight compared to normal weight mothers (OR: 1.1, CI: 1.1-1.2), mistimed pregnancies (OR: 1.2, CI: 1.0-1.4), or unplanned pregnancies (OR: 1.3, CI: 1.0-1.7), compared to planned pregnancies.--NEW SECTION--This is the first paper to show an association between use of highly pollutant biomass fuel and prevalence of LBW babies in Bangladesh, suggesting that besides polluting the air and causing respiratory illnesses, biomass fuel combustion may also affect the health of fetuses in utero.

Primary outcome was change in QoL (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30-item) with respect to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response after four cycles of cabazitaxel. Secondary outcomes included occurrence of adverse events (AEs).--NEW SECTION--Of 527 men, 348 received four cycles of cabazitaxel and 266 had the necessary PSA level measurements. After four cycles, 92 (34.6%) men had a PSA level decrease ≥50% (responders). QoL remained stable throughout the study (P = 0.62). Change in QoL did not differ between responders and non-responders (P = 0.69). Change in PSA level and global health status between baseline and four cycles showed an inversely proportional relationship (correlation coefficient -0.14; 95% confidence interval -0.26 to -0.01; P = 0.03), with increasing PSA level corresponding to lower health status. Responders showed no change in physical functioning vs baseline (-1.75, P = 0.12); non-responders showed a reduction vs baseline (-7.00, P < 0.001) and responders (P = 0.05). Responders showed an improvement in pain vs baseline (-7.61, P = 0.05) and vs non-responders (P = 0.01). AEs occurred in 292 patients (55.4%), most commonly anaemia (16.5%), fatigue (12.3%) and diarrhoea (11.8%).

Traditional assays available for monitoring bacterial cultures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. We present a magnesium zinc oxide (MZO) nanostructure-modified quartz crystal microbalance (MZOnano-QCM) biosensor to dynamically monitor antimicrobial effects on E. coli and S. cerevisiae. MZO nanostructures were grown on the top electrode of a standard QCM using metal-organic chemical-vapor deposition (MOCVD). The MZO nanostructures are chosen for their multifunctionality, biocompatibility, and giant effective sensing surface. The MZO surface-wettability and morphology are controlled, offering high-sensitivity to various biological/biochemical species. MZO-nanostructures showed over 4-times greater cell viability over ZnO due to MZO releasing 4-times lower Zn2+ density in the cell medium than ZnO. The MZOnano-QCM was applied to detect the effects of ampicillin and tetracycline on sensitive and resistant strains of E.coli, as well as effects of amphotericin-B and miconazole on S. cerevisiae through the device's time-dependent frequency shift and motional resistance. The MZOnano-QCM showed 4-times more sensitivity over ZnOnano-QCM and over 10-times better than regular QCM. For comparison, the optical density at 600nm (OD600) method and the cell viability assay were employed as standard references to verify the detection results from MZOnano-QCM. In the case of S. cerevisiae, the OD600 method failed to distinguish between cytotoxic and cytostatic drug effects whereas the MZOnano-QCM was able to accurately detect the drug effects. The MZOnano-QCM biosensor provides a promising technology enabling dynamic and rapid diagnostics for antimicrobial drug development and AMR detection.",eng,Biosensors & bioelectronics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

We also included reports describing implementation of identified models, as case studies. We searched Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the WHO Global Health Library. We also searched websites of relevant organizations.

Relatively little is known about the effects of such bans on voluntary home smoking behavior. Meanwhile, private spaces, such as homes, have replaced public spaces as the primary milieu of secondhand smoke exposure.--NEW SECTION--A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles was conducted using multiple databases including Cochrane Library, Cinahl, Embase, Global Health, Health Star, Joanna Briggs, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PAIS International, PubMed, and Web of Science. We examined peer-reviewed studies that considered the impact of legislation-based public smoking bans on enactment of private home smoking restrictions.--NEW SECTION--Sixteen articles published between 2002 and 2014 were identified and included. Our results suggest overall positive effects post-legislative ban with the majority of studies demonstrating significant increases in home smoking restrictions. Studies focusing on smoking and nonsmoking samples as well as child populations are discussed in depth.--NEW SECTION--Existing evidence indicates an overall significant positive effect post-legislative ban on voluntary home smoking restrictions. While disentangling these effects over space and time remains a challenge, scientific research has converged in dispelling any notion of significant displacement of smoking into the home. Policy makers, especially those in countries without existing public smoking legislation, can rest assured that these types of bans contribute to the minimization of tobacco-related harm.--NEW SECTION--Findings converge in dispelling notions of displacement of smoking into the home as a consequence of legislative bans that prohibit smoking in public spaces. Evidence from the studies reviewed suggests that through their influence on social norms, legislative bans on smoking in public places may encourage citizens to establish voluntary home smoking restrictions, thus decreasing harm related to secondhand smoke.",eng,Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Accurate measurements of resting energy expenditure (REE) is a key foundation for successful obesity treatment. Clinical dietitians rely heavily on measured or calculated REE to tailor dietary interventions. Indirect calorimetry (IC) is the gold standard for measuring REE. However, predictive resting energy expenditure (PREE) equations are commonly used when IC is unavailable due to cost or practicality. PREE equations differ based on variables such as age, gender, weight, and height and selecting the most accurate PREE for an individual is crucial to avoid over or underestimation of energy requirements. Published studies investigating the accuracy of PREE equations in obese children and adolescents have reported inconsistent findings, which likely result from heterogeneity in the patient populations studied. Accordingly, this study aimed to (a) assess the accuracy of the published PREE equations in a group of severely obese (SO) adolescents using IC measurement, and (b) determine if there is a BMI threshold at which the PREE equations become less accurate.--NEW SECTION--SO adolescents were studied using IC. REE was calculated using nine commonly used PREE equations. Generalized linear regression equations were used to compare absolute and relative differences between calculated and measured REE (MREE) for each PREE equation. Accuracy was calculated as the percentage of subjects with PREE values within 10 percent of MREE.--NEW SECTION--226 SO adolescents (mean ± SD age: 15.9 ± 1.9 years; weight: 126.9 ± 24.5 kg; BMI: 44.9 ± 8.1 kg/m2) participated. Mean MREE was 2163 ± 443 kcal/d. PREE calculated by the Mifflin equation was the only equation without a statistically significant bias compared to MREE (mean bias of -23 ± 307 kcal/d; p = 0.26). Mifflin was also the most accurate with 61% of individuals within ±10% of MREE. PREE equations accuracy was not associated with degree of BMI elevation (31-69 kg/m2).--NEW SECTION--In adolescents with severe obesity, the Mifflin equation best predicts REE. This should be the equation applied when using PREE to optimize nutritional care in this population.",eng,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2017

Chief among the former's concerns are exploring the gap between the programmatic intentions of global health and the unintended or unanticipated consequences of their deployment. This article asserts that recent work on contingency within geography offers significant conceptual potential for examining this gap. It therefore uses the example of alcohol taxation in Botswana, an emergent global health target and tool, to explore how geographical contingency and the emergent, contingent geographies that result might help counter the prevailing tendency for geography to be side-stepped within critical studies of global health.

For the first time, clinicians and researchers with experience in the field of metronomics, coming from different countries in Latin America, had the opportunity of presenting and discussing their work. The talks were organised in three main sessions related to experience in the pre-clinical, and clinical (paediatric and adult) areas. The different presentations demonstrated that the fields of metronomic chemotherapy and repurposing drugs in oncology, known as metronomics, constitute a branch of cancer therapy in permanent evolution, which have strong groups working in Latin America, both in the preclinical and the clinical settings including large, adequately designed randomised studies. It was shown that metronomics offers treatments, which, whether they are combined or not with the standard therapeutic approaches, are not only effective but also minimally toxic, with the consequent improvement of the patient's quality of life, and inexpensive, a feature very important in low resource clinical settings.

27610068,NA,Vitamin D and extra-skeletal health: causality or consequence.,"Vitamin D deficiency /insufficiency is widely recognized as a global health problem that is likely to be involved in pathogenesis or progression of many acute and chronic health disorders. Its relation to skeletal health has been clearly demonstrated and thoroughly examined. This review aims to highlight the continuous debate about the relation between vitamin D and extra-skeletal health and whether it is a causality or just an association. Overall, the available evidence does not meet the criteria for establishing cause-and-effect relationships because of the limitations of observational studies to corroborate the causality due to many potential confounders. Moreover, the causal relationship couldn't be established in randomized studies or in many meta-analyses. This may reflect the fact that vitamin D level reduction is just a biomarker of ill health. The inflammatory processes involved in the disease occurrence and the functional limitations of the diseases would have a role in reducing serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D ""25 (OH) D"" level, which would explain why low vitamin D is reported in a wide range of disorders. This may underscore the possibility of harm instead of benefit of vitamin D supplementation when its exact role is not fully established, thus many guidelines and interest groups are still hesitant toward recommending replacement in extra-skeletal disease. Future directions entails the need for a large well-designed randomized control trials (RCTs) to resolve the active debate on the benefits of vitamin D replacement for extra-skeletal disease, and not only that, future studies should establish specific, clinically relevant effects of vitamin D repletion, provide cut-values for optimal serum levels of 25 (OH) D, and appropriate doses for non-skeletal health benefits.",eng,International journal of health sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Along with the improvements in living standards, has also come negative impact on health for the middle class. The study objective was to assess sex differences in obesity prevalence, diet, and physical activity among urban middle-class Bangladeshi.--NEW SECTION--In this cross-sectional study, conducted in 2012, we randomly selected 402 adults from Mohammedpur, Dhaka. The sampling technique was multi-stage random sampling. We used standardized questionnaires for data collection and measured height, weight, and waist circumference.--NEW SECTION--Mean age (standard deviation) was 49.4 (12.7) years. The prevalence of both generalized (79% vs. 53%) and central obesity (85% vs. 42%) were significantly higher in women than men. Women reported spending more time watching TV and spending less time walking than men (p<.05); however, men reported a higher intake of unhealthy foods such as fast food and soft drinks.--NEW SECTION--We conclude that the prevalence of obesity is significantly higher in urban middle-class Bangladeshis than previous urban estimates, and the burden of obesity disproportionately affects women.

The conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimen for CRC not only has a low cure rate but also causes side effects. Many studies have shown that adequate intake of fruits and vegetables in the diet may have a protective effect on CRC occurrence, possibly due to the special biological protective effect of the phytochemicals in these foods. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that phytochemicals play strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer roles by regulating specific signaling pathways and molecular markers to inhibit the occurrence and development of CRC. This review summarizes the progress on CRC prevention using the phytochemicals sulforaphane, curcumin and resveratrol, and elaborates on the specific underlying mechanisms. Thus, we believe that phytochemicals might provide a novel therapeutic approach for CRC prevention, but future clinical studies are needed to confirm the specific preventive effect of phytochemicals on cancer.",eng,World journal of gastroenterology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Preliminary literature search suggests that there are at present no reliable estimates on the total prevalence of chronic wounds for different settings and categories of chronic wounds. Such information is essential for policy and planning purposes as the increasing number of elderly and the prevalence of lifestyle diseases point in the direction of an increased burden. Knowledge about the prevalence and incidence of chronic wounds in relation to population characteristics is important for informing healthcare planning and resource allocation. The objective is to present a transparent process for how to review the existing literature on the prevalence and incidence rates of chronic wounds and resulting implications.--NEW SECTION--We will search electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, the EBM Reviews and Cochrane, Cumulative Index to Nursing and allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Global Health) and reference lists of included articles. Two investigators will independently screen titles and abstracts and select studies involving adults with chronic wounds.

Conflicting evidence exists regarding the impact of hand burns on long-term health status and global functioning. The objective of this study was to identify patient and clinical characteristics that predict health status and hand function of people at 12-24 months after hand burn.--NEW SECTION--The Burns Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B) and the Brief Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire (Brief MHQ) were administered to community-dwelling adults who were between one and two years after admission to a statewide burns service for burns including one or both hands. Demographic, injury, and treatment data were collected to identify which factors predict health status and hand function in the second year after admission. Linear regression analyses adjusted for total burn surface area and burn depth were conducted to identify important predictors or outcomes.--NEW SECTION--The sample (n=41) was 80.5% male, with a mean age of 44.5 years and total body surface area (TBSA) of 8.4%. Psychiatric illness (regression coefficient -56.6, confidence interval (95% CI) -76.70, -36.49) and female gender (-20.3; 95% CI -0.77, -40.29) were key predictors of poorer global health status on the BSHS-B.

The most immediate and potent anti-viral defense mechanism is the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) which are activated rapidly following recognition of viral infection by host pathogen recognition receptors (PRR). The mechanisms of innate cellular signaling downstream of PRR activation remain to be fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that CASP2 and RIPK1 domain-containing adaptor with death domain (CRADD/RAIDD) is a critical component in type I IFN production.--NEW SECTION--The role of RAIDD during IFN-I production was investigated using western blot, shRNA mediated lentiviral knockdown, immunoprecipitation and IFN-I driven dual luciferase assay.--NEW SECTION--Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the molecular interaction of RAIDD with interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and its phosphorylating kinase IKKε. Using an IFN-4α driven dual luciferase analysis in RAIDD deficient cells, type I IFN activation by IKKε and IRF7 was dramatically reduced. Furthermore, deletion of either the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) or death domain (DD) of RAIDD inhibited IKKε and IRF7 mediated interferon-4α activation.--NEW SECTION--We have identified that the adaptor molecule RAIDD coordinates IKKε and IRF7 interaction to ensure efficient expression of type I interferon.",eng,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Despite extensive investment from donors, evaluations of the long-term effect of these two interventions are scarce. We used nationally representative surveys of health systems in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa to examine the association of in-service training and supervision with provider quality in antenatal and sick child care. The results of our analysis showed that observed quality of care was poor, with fewer than half of evidence-based actions completed by health workers, on average. In-service training and supervision were associated with quality of sick child care; they were associated with quality of antenatal care only when provided jointly. All associations were modest-at most, improvements related to interventions were equivalent to 2 additional provider actions out of the 18-40 actions expected per visit. In-service training and supportive supervision as delivered were not sufficient to meaningfully improve the quality of care in these countries.

QoL was compared to normative data, and the influence of age, tumor characteristics, lymphadenectomy, RT, and acute toxicities was assessed. VD use and its effect on subjective vaginal shortening/tightness was analyzed.--NEW SECTION--QoL was reduced, particularly in younger patients. Vaginal brachytherapy only and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) were associated with better global health status and reduced chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Higher acute GI toxicity was associated with increased chronic GI symptoms, particularly diarrhea, and reduced role functioning. Higher acute urinary toxicity was associated with increased chronic urological symptoms, muscular/pelvic pain, and chronic GI symptoms, as well as with reduced emotional/social functioning and reduced global health status. Sexual interest/activity was increased despite vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Sexual interest/activity increased with age. Only few, mainly younger patients used the VD. VD use >1 year was found in women with higher sexual interest/activity. Acute vaginal toxicity and chronic pain prevented VD use. Subjective vaginal shortening/tightness was not reduced in VD users.--NEW SECTION--RT technique and acute toxicities are prognostic for the extent of chronic symptoms and long-term QoL.

By the close of the nineteenth century, Schools of Public Health (SPHs) began to emerge in western countries in response to major contemporary public health challenges. The Flexner Report (1910) emphasized the centrality of preventive medicine, sanitation, and public health measures in health professional education. The Alma Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care (PHC) in 1978 was a critical milestone, especially for low and middle-income countries (LMICs), conceptualizing a close working relationship between PHC and public health measures. The Commission on Social Determinants of Health (2005-2008) strengthened the case for SPHs in LMICs as key stakeholders in efforts to reduce global health inequities. This scoping review groups text into public health challenges faced by LMICs and the role of SPHs in addressing these challenges.--NEW SECTION--The challenges faced by LMICs include rapid urbanization, environmental degradation, unfair terms of global trade, limited capacity for equitable growth, mass displacements associated with conflicts and natural disasters, and universal health coverage. Poor governance and externally imposed donor policies and agendas, further strain the fragile health systems of LMICs faced with epidemiological transition. Moreover barriers to education and research imposed by limited resources, political and economic instability, and unbalanced partnerships additionally aggravate the crisis. To address these contextual challenges effectively, SPHs are offering broad based health professional education, conducting multidisciplinary population based research and fostering collaborative partnerships. SPHs are also looked upon as the key drivers to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs).--NEW SECTION--SPHs in LMICs can contribute to overcoming several public health challenges being faced by LMICs, including achieving SDGs. Most importantly they can develop cadres of competent and well-motivated public health professionals: educators, practitioners and researchers who ask questions that address fundamental health determinants, seek solutions as agents of change within their mandates, provide specific services and serve as advocates for multilevel partnerships.

There have been some focuses on antidiarrheal therapies that may reduce fluid losses and intestinal motility in diarrheal diseases. In the present study, we identified shikonin as an inhibitor of TMEM16A chloride channel activity using cell-based fluorescent-quenching assay. The IC50 value of shikonin was 6.5 μM. Short-circuit current measurements demonstrated that shikonin inhibited Eact-induced Cl(-) current in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 value of 1.5 μM. Short-circuit current measurement showed that shikonin exhibited inhibitory effect against CCh-induced Cl(-) currents in mouse colonic epithelia but did not affect cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration as well as the other major enterocyte chloride channel conductance regulator. Characterization study found that shikonin inhibited basolateral K(+) channel activity without affecting Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activities. In vivo studies revealed that shikonin significantly delayed intestinal motility in mice and reduced stool water content in a neonatal mice model of rotaviral diarrhea without affecting the viral infection process in vivo. Taken together, the results suggested that shikonin inhibited enterocyte calcium-activated chloride channels, the inhibitory effect was partially through inhbition of basolateral K(+) channel activity, and shikonin could be a lead compound in the treatment of rotaviral secretory diarrhea.",eng,Frontiers in pharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27601578,10.1128/mBio.01396-16,Zika Virus Is Not Uniquely Stable at Physiological Temperatures Compared to Other Flaviviruses.,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has emerged as a global health threat due in part to its association with congenital abnormalities. Other globally relevant flaviviruses include dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV). High-resolution structures of ZIKV reveal many similarities to DENV and suggest some differences, including an extended glycan loop (D. Sirohi, Z. Chen, L. Sun, T. Klose, T. C. Pierson, et al., 352:467-470, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf5316) and unique interactions among envelope (E) protein residues that were proposed to confer increased virion stability and contribute mechanistically to the distinctive pathobiology of ZIKV (V. A. Kostyuchenko, E. X. Lim, S. Zhang, G. Fibriansah, T. S. Ng, et al., Nature 533:425-428, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17994). However, in the latter study, virus stability was inferred by measuring the loss of infectivity following a short incubation period. Here, we rigorously assessed the relative stability of ZIKV, DENV, and WNV by measuring changes in infectivity following prolonged incubation at physiological temperatures. At 37°C, the half-life of ZIKV was approximately twice as long as the half-life of DENV (11.8 and 5.2 h, respectively) but shorter than that of WNV (17.7 h). Incubation at 40°C accelerated the loss of ZIKV infectivity. Increasing virion maturation efficiency modestly increased ZIKV stability, as observed previously with WNV and DENV. Finally, mutations at E residues predicted to confer increased stability to ZIKV did not affect virion half-life. Our results demonstrate that ZIKV is not uniquely stable relative to other flaviviruses, suggesting that its unique pathobiology is explained by an alternative mechanism.--NEW SECTION--Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the Flavivirus genus, which includes other clinically relevant mosquito-borne pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV). Historically, ZIKV infection was characterized by a self-limiting, mild disease, but recent outbreaks have been associated with severe clinical complications, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly, which are atypical of other flavivirus infections. Moreover, ZIKV has been detected in saliva, urine, and semen, and it may be sexually transmitted. Analysis of a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopic reconstruction of ZIKV hypothesized that the unusual stability of this virus contributes to its distinctive pathobiology. Here, we directly compared the stability of ZIKV to that of other flaviviruses following prolonged incubation in solution at physiological temperatures. We found that the stability of multiple ZIKV strains, including those from recent outbreaks, is intermediate between that of DENV and WNV, suggesting an alternative explanation for the unique clinical manifestations of ZIKV infection.",eng,mBio,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016

Methods Patients with relapsed multiple myeloma were randomly assigned to receive KRd or Rd. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and myeloma-specific module were administered at baseline; day 1 of cycles 3, 6, 12, and 18; and after treatment. The Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QoL) scale and seven subscales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, physical functioning, role functioning, disease symptoms, and adverse effects of treatment) were compared between groups using a mixed model for repeated measures. The percentages of responders with ≥ 5- or 15-point GHS/QoL improvement at each cycle were compared between groups. Results Baseline questionnaire compliance was excellent (94.1% of randomly assigned patients). KRd patients had higher GHS/QoL scores versus Rd patients over 18 treatment cycles (two-sided P < .001). The minimal important difference was met at cycle 12 (5.6 points) and approached at cycle 18 (4.8 points). There was no difference between groups for the other prespecified subscales from ASPIRE. A higher proportion of KRd patients met the GHS/QoL responder definition (≥ 5-point improvement) with statistical differences at cycle 12 (KRd v Rd patients, 25.5% v 17.4%, respectively) and 18 (KRd v Rd patients, 24.2% v 12.9%, respectively). Conclusion KRd improves GHS/QoL without negatively affecting patient-reported symptoms when compared with Rd.

Using a random-effects model, overall risk estimates were derived for each increment of 10 μg/m(3) of pollutant concentration. Of the 485 in-depth reviewed studies, 8 citations, involving approximately 700,000 events, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All the main air pollutants analyzed were not associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis (OR = 1.005, 95% CI = 0.998-1.012 for PM2.5; OR = 0.995, 95% CI = 0.984-1.007 for PM10; OR = 1.006, 95% CI = 0.994-1.019 for NO2). Based on exposure period and thrombosis location, additional subgroup analyses provided results comparable with those of the overall analyses. There was no evidence of publication bias.

Adsorption technology is an easy and flexible method for arsenic removal with high efficiency. In this Article, we demonstrated the synthesis of mesoporous MgO hollow spheres (MgO-HS) and their application as high performance arsenite (As(III)) adsorbent. MgO-HS with uniform particle size (∼180 nm), high specific surface area (175 m(2) g(-1)), and distinguished mesopores (9.5 nm in size) have been prepared by hard-templating approach using mesoporous hollow carbon spheres as templates. An ultrahigh maximum As(III) adsorption capacity (Qmax) of 892 mg g(-1) was achieved in batch As(III) removal study. Adsorption kinetic study demonstrated that MgO-HS could enable As(III) adsorption 6 times faster as a commercial MgO adsorbent. The ultrahigh adsorption capacity and faster adsorption kinetics were attributed to the unique structure and morphology of MgO-HS that enabled fast transformation into a flower-like porous structure composed of ultrathin Mg(OH)2 nanosheets. This in situ formed structure provided abundant and highly accessible hydroxyl groups, which enhanced the adsorption performance toward As(III). The outstanding As(III) removal capability of MgO-HS showed their great promise as highly efficient adsorbents for As(III) sequestration from contaminated water.",eng,ACS applied materials & interfaces,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27599470,10.1038/emi.2016.102,Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus: a potential vector to transmit Zika virus.,"Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a threat to global health since the outbreak in Brazil in 2015. Although ZIKV is generally considered an Aedes-transmitted pathogen, new evidence has shown that parts of the virus closely resemble Culex-transmitted viruses. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the competence of Culex species for ZIKV to understand their potential as vectors. In this study, female Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus were orally exposed to ZIKV. Mosquito midguts, salivary glands and ovaries were tested for ZIKV to measure infection and dissemination at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 18 days post exposure (pe). In addition, saliva was collected from mosquitoes after infection and infant mice were bitten by infected mosquitoes to measure the transmission ability of Cx. p. quinquefasciatus. The results showed that the peak time of virus appearance in the salivary glands was day 8 pe, with 90% infection rate and an estimated virus titer of 3.92±0.49 lg RNA copies/mL. Eight of the nine infant mice had positive brains after being bitten by infected mosquitoes, which meant that Cx. p. quinquefasciatus could be infected with and transmit ZIKV following oral infection. These laboratory results clearly demonstrate the potential role of Cx. p. quinquefasciatus as a vector of ZIKV in China. Because there are quite different vector management strategies required to control Aedes (Stegomyia) species and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus, an integrated approach may be required should a Zika epidemic occur.",eng,Emerging microbes & infections,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We retrospectively obtained microbiology laboratory and hospital databases of nine public hospitals in northeast Thailand from 2004 to 2010, and linked these with the national death registry to obtain the 30-day mortality outcome. The 30-day mortality in those with MDR community-acquired bacteraemia, healthcare-associated bacteraemia, and hospital-acquired bacteraemia were 35% (549/1555), 49% (247/500), and 53% (640/1198), respectively. We estimate that 19,122 of 45,209 (43%) deaths in patients with hospital-acquired infection due to MDR bacteria in Thailand in 2010 represented excess mortality caused by MDR. We demonstrate that national statistics on the epidemiology and burden of MDR in LMICs could be improved by integrating information from readily available databases. The prevalence and mortality attributable to MDR in Thailand are high. This is likely to reflect the situation in other LMICs.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

There is strong evidence that risk of IPV is heightened in HIV-infected women, and emerging evidence linking experiencing IPV and/or HIV to a higher likelihood of experiencing mental health problems. This triple burden makes women in Africa, living in the epicentre of HIV, all the more vulnerable. In this synthesis, this study reviewed literature pertaining to the overlap of IPV, HIV, and mental health problems. It presents a series of geographical maps illustrating the heavy burden of IPV and HIV globally, and how these coincide with a growing prevalence of mental health problems in Africa. Furthermore, it presents evidence on: the association between IPV and HIV, shared risk factors, and health consequences. This synthesis sheds light on the fact that ∼30% of women are affected by these three burdens concurrently, and the need for intervention is essential.

This review set out to systematically investigate whether sex ratios in case notifications reflect differences in disease prevalence and to identify gaps in access to and/or utilisation of diagnostic services.--NEW SECTION--In accordance with the published protocol (CRD42015022163), TB prevalence surveys in nationally representative and sub-national adult populations (age ≥ 15 y) in low- and middle-income countries published between 1 January 1993 and 15 March 2016 were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, Global Health, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; review of abstracts; and correspondence with the World Health Organization. Random-effects meta-analyses examined male-to-female (M:F) ratios in TB prevalence and prevalence-to-notification (P:N) ratios for smear-positive TB. Meta-regression was done to identify factors associated with higher M:F ratios in prevalence and higher P:N ratios. Eighty-three publications describing 88 surveys with over 3.1 million participants in 28 countries were identified (36 surveys in Africa, three in the Americas, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, 28 in South-East Asia and 17 in the Western Pacific). Fifty-six surveys reported in 53 publications were included in quantitative analyses. Overall random-effects weighted M:F prevalence ratios were 2.21 (95% CI 1.92-2.54; 56 surveys) for bacteriologically positive TB and 2.51 (95% CI 2.07-3.04; 40 surveys) for smear-positive TB. M:F prevalence ratios were highest in South-East Asia and in surveys that did not require self-report of signs/symptoms in initial screening procedures. The summary random-effects weighted M:F ratio for P:N ratios was 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.91; 34 surveys). We intended to stratify the analyses by age, HIV status, and rural or urban setting; however, few studies reported such data.--NEW SECTION--TB prevalence is significantly higher among men than women in low- and middle-income countries, with strong evidence that men are disadvantaged in seeking and/or accessing TB care in many settings. Global strategies and national TB programmes should recognise men as an underserved high-risk group and improve men's access to diagnostic and screening services to reduce the overall burden of TB more effectively and ensure gender equity in TB care.",eng,PLoS medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27598202,10.3390/cancers8090083,Prospects in the Application of Photodynamic Therapy in Oral Cancer and Premalignant Lesions.,"Oral cancer is a global health burden with significantly poor survival, especially when the diagnosis is at its late stage. Despite advances in current treatment modalities, there has been minimal improvement in survival rates over the last five decades. The development of local recurrence, regional failure, and the formation of second primary tumors accounts for this poor outcome. For survivors, cosmetic and functional compromises resulting from treatment are often devastating. These statistics underscore the need for novel approaches in the management of this deadly disease. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment modality that involves administration of a light-sensitive drug, known as a photosensitizer, followed by light irradiation of an appropriate wavelength that corresponds to an absorbance band of the sensitizer. In the presence of tissue oxygen, cytotoxic free radicals that are produced cause direct tumor cell death, damage to the microvasculature, and induction of inflammatory reactions at the target sites. PDT offers a prospective new approach in controlling this disease at its various stages either as a stand-alone therapy for early lesions or as an adjuvant therapy for advanced cases. In this review, we aim to explore the applications of PDT in oral cancer therapy and to present an overview of the recent advances in PDT that can potentially reposition its utility for oral cancer treatment.",eng,Cancers,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We present health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes from KEYNOTE-002.--NEW SECTION--Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to pembrolizumab 2 or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or investigator-choice chemotherapy. HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 instrument. A constrained longitudinal data analysis model was implemented to assess between-arm differences in HRQoL scores. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01704287.--NEW SECTION--Of the 540 patients enrolled, 520 were included in the HRQoL analysis. Baseline global health status (GHS) was similar across treatment arms. Compliance rates at week 12 were 76.6% (n = 108), 82.3% (n = 121), and 86.4% (n = 133) for the control, pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W, and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W arms, respectively. From baseline to week 12, GHS/HRQoL scores were maintained to a higher degree in the pembrolizumab arms compared with the chemotherapy arm (decrease of -2.6 for each pembrolizumab arm versus -9.1 for chemotherapy; P = 0.01 for each pembrolizumab arm versus chemotherapy). Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab experienced deterioration in GHS at week 12 (31.8% for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 26.6% for 10 mg/kg, and 38.3% for chemotherapy), with similar trends observed for the individual functioning and symptoms scales.--NEW SECTION--HRQoL was better maintained with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy in KEYNOTE-002, supporting the use of pembrolizumab in patients with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma.",eng,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2025-04-23,2016

Research and development (R&D) for these diseases is still a low priority on the health agenda. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) are quickly growing economies and having more and more positive impact on global health. Additionally, their R&D capacity is believed to be enhanced through decades of investment in education and life science research. The BRICS, as a group of emerging and developing countries, are expected to make greater contributions to solving the problem that mainly affects the entire developing countries community. However, there has been little research to provide a macroscopic overview of BRICS' effort in R&D for neglected diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate scientific production in BRICS countries in this area and their main research hotspots.--NEW SECTION--Global relevant literature was searched without time limits through PubMed and high yield countries were identified using GoPubMed. Literature up to the end of 2013 from the BRICS was obtained and high frequency words were extracted and clustered using Bibliography Item Co-occurrence Mining System 2.0 (BICOMS) and Graphical Clustering Toolkit 1.0 (gCLUTO).--NEW SECTION--In total, 32, 47, 51, 31 and 44 high frequency words from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa respectively were extracted for clustering analysis. The clustering indicated that eight diseases were research hotspots in BRICS countries. India had the most extensive hotspots and Brazil came in second. The other three countries shared common research foci: helminthiasis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and tuberculosis.--NEW SECTION--Developed countries still make the majority of contributions to R&D on neglected diseases, but BRICS countries are playing a growing role. Instead of the ""big three diseases"" (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) recognized by WHO, the BRICS focus more on major causes of disease burden in their own countries.

In type 2 diabetes both microvascular (nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy) and macrovascular complications arise. In kidney, renal pathological changes leading to diabetic nephropathy are mainly secondary to atherosclerosis of the intra and extra renal arteries together with microangiopathy of the glomerular capillaries, afferent arterioles and efferent arterioles. Renal resistive index (RRI) is defined as a ratio of the difference between maximum and minimum (end-diastolic) flow velocity to maximum flow velocity derived from the Doppler measurements of main renal and intrarenal (segmental/interlobar) arteries. Renal resistive index is tightly related to renal arteriolosclerosis, and represents an integrated index of arterial compliance, pulsatility and downstream microvascular impedance. In meantime, growing suggest that RRI has also been closely related with atherosclerosis. Most studies performed in type 2 diabetes showed RRI is increased in type 2 diabetes.

Currently licensed therapies have modest curative efficacy, which is as a result of their transient effects and limited action on the viral replication intermediate comprising covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Gene editing with artificial HBV-specific endonucleases and use of artificial activators of the RNA interference pathway have shown anti-HBV therapeutic promise. Although results from these gene therapies are encouraging, maximizing durable antiviral effects is important. To address this goal, a strategy that entails combining gene editing with homology-directed DNA recombination (HDR), to introduce HBV-silencing artificial primary microRNAs (pri-miRs) into HBV DNA targets, is reported here. Previously described transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) that target the core and surface sequences of HBV were used to introduce double stranded breaks in the viral DNA. Simultaneous administration of donor sequences encoding artificial promoterless anti-HBV pri-miRs, with flanking arms that were homologous to sequences adjoining the TALENs' targets, augmented antiviral efficacy. Analysis showed targeted integration and the length of the flanking homologous arms of donor DNA had a minimal effect on antiviral efficiency. These results support the notion that gene editing and silencing may be combined to effect improved inhibition of HBV gene expression.",eng,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Studies focusing on the natural history of CKD are challenging to design and conduct, because of the long time-course of disease progression, a wide variation in etiologies, and a large amount of clinical variability among individuals with CKD. With the difference in health-related behaviors, healthcare delivery, genetics, and environmental exposures, this variability is greater across countries than within one locale and may not be captured effectively in a single study.--NEW SECTION--Studies were invited to join the network. Prerequisites for membership included: 1) observational designs with a priori hypotheses and defined study objectives, patient-level information, prospective data acquisition and collection of bio-samples, all focused on predialysis CKD patients; 2) target sample sizes of 1,000 patients for adult cohorts and 300 for pediatric cohorts; and 3) minimum follow-up of three years.

An Urgent Need for Integrated Care.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health issue with high social and economic costs. Concomitant chronic cardiac disorders are frequent in patients with COPD, likely owing to shared risk factors (e.g., aging, cigarette smoke, inactivity, persistent low-grade pulmonary and systemic inflammation) and add to the overall morbidity and mortality of patients with COPD. The prevalence and incidence of cardiac comorbidities are higher in patients with COPD than in matched control subjects, although estimates of prevalence vary widely. Furthermore, cardiac diseases contribute to disease severity in patients with COPD, being a common cause of hospitalization and a frequent cause of death. The differential diagnosis may be challenging, especially in older and smoking subjects complaining of unspecific symptoms, such as dyspnea and fatigue. The therapeutic management of patients with cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities may be similarly challenging: bronchodilators may have cardiac side effects, and, vice versa, some cardiac medications should be used with caution in patients with lung disease. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence of the relationship between COPD and the three most frequent and important cardiac comorbidities in patients with COPD: ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. We have chosen a practical approach, first summarizing relevant epidemiological and clinical data, then discussing the diagnostic and screening procedures, and finally evaluating the impact of lung-heart comorbidities on the therapeutic management of patients with COPD and heart diseases.",eng,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Current practice of measuring of exposure to BPA includes the measurement of unconjugated BPA (aglycone) and total (both conjugated and unconjugated) BPA; the difference between the two measurements leads to estimation of conjugated forms. However, the measurement of BPA as the end analyte leads to inaccurate estimates from potential interferences from background sources during sample collection and analysis. BPA glucuronides (BPAG) and sulfates (BPAS) represent better candidates for biomarkers of BPA exposure, since they require in vivo metabolism and are not prone to external contamination. In this work, the primary focus was to review the current state of the art in analytical methods available to quantitate BPA conjugates. The entire analytical procedure for the simultaneous extraction and detection of aglycone BPA and conjugates is covered, from sample pre-treatment, extraction, separation, ionization, and detection. Solid phase extraction coupled with liquid chromatograph and tandem mass spectrometer analysis provides the most sensitive detection and quantification of BPA conjugates. Discussed herein are the applications of BPA conjugates analysis in human exposure assessment studies. Measuring these potential biomarkers of BPA exposure has only recently become analytically feasible and there are limitations and challenges to overcome in biomonitoring studies.",eng,The Science of the total environment,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The coexistence of these two highly prevalent diseases has made the already existing treatments very complex. This issue is of particular significance to developing countries like India that bear a significant burden of these two diseases.--NEW SECTION--Retrospective analysis of 1000 consecutively admitted patients in a tertiary care hospital were analyzed for the coexistence of Tuberculosis and Diabetes Mellitus.--NEW SECTION--The study found that a significant proportion of diabetic patients had coexistent tuberculosis (65.5%). Rural population was predominantly affected in both the genders. The study observed that the coexistence of these two conditions increased with advanced age.--NEW SECTION--The coexistence of Diabetes Mellitus with Tuberculosis needs to identified early and adequately addressed.

Bioconjugation technology, exploited here for an Shigella flexneri 2a candidate vaccine, offers a novel and potentially cost-effective way to develop and produce vaccines against a major pathogen of global health importance. Flexyn2a, a novel S. flexneri 2a bioconjugate vaccine made of the polysaccharide component of the S. flexneri 2a O-antigen, conjugated to the exotoxin protein A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (EPA), was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity among healthy adults in a single-blind, phase I study with a staggered randomization approach. Thirty subjects (12 receiving 10 μg Flexyn2a, 12 receiving Flexyn2a with aluminum adjuvant, and 6 receiving placebo) were administered two injections 4 weeks apart and were followed for 168 days. Flexyn2a was well-tolerated, independently of the adjuvant and number of injections. The Flexyn2a vaccine elicited statistically significant S. flexneri 2a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific humoral responses at all time points postimmunization in all groups that received the vaccine. Elicited serum antibodies were functional, as evidenced by bactericidal activity against S. flexneri 2a. The bioconjugate candidate vaccine Flexyn2a has a satisfactory safety profile and elicited a robust humoral response to S. flexneri 2a LPS with or without inclusion of an adjuvant. Moreover, the bioconjugate also induced functional antibodies, showing the technology's features in producing a promising candidate vaccine.

32518536,10.1016/j.simpat.2016.06.005,Multi-tier cloud infrastructure support for reliable global health awareness system.,"The exceptional outbreaks of a number of epidemic diseases such as Ebola, SARS, Zika and H1N1 and their wide distribution over multiple regions calls for a reliable global health awareness system. This system is needed to achieve early detection of such emergencies. Furthermore, such health awareness system should be capable of predicting the outbreaks patterns to facilitate future countermeasure planning. This health awareness system should cover large scale regions that can be extended to multiple countries, continents and ultimately the globe. Many advanced and industrial countries are still struggling in building such system effectively even with the availability of resources and domain experts. The realization of a reliable health awareness system is accompanied with multiple challenges such as the availability of resources and experts, the global agreements about the system from the legislative and control point of view and the availability of the infrastructure that will support the system functionality with a reasonable cost. This paper presents a novel global health awareness system that overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The system is exploiting the emerging cloud computing services availability over the globe. To handle the large scale requirements, we introduce a multi-tier based cloud system that spans over four tiers starting from the monitored subjects to a centralized global cloud system. Also, we present a mixed integer optimization formulation to tackle the issues related to the latency of detecting outbreaks. Our results show that processing the data in multi-tier health awareness system will reduce the overall delay significantly and enable efficient health data sharing.",eng,Simulation modelling practice and theory,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"This research article reports on factors influencing initial voluntary uptake of community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), and renewal decisions.--NEW SECTION--Following PRISMA protocol, we conducted a comprehensive search of academic and gray literature, including academic databases in social science, economics and medical sciences (e.g., Econlit, Global health, Medline, Proquest) and other electronic resources (e.g., Eldis and Google scholar). Search strategies were developed using the thesaurus or index terms (e.g., MeSH) specific to the databases, combined with free text terms related to CBHI or health insurance. Searches were conducted from May 2013 to November 2013 in English, French, German, and Spanish. From the initial search yield of 15,770 hits, 54 relevant studies were retained for analysis of factors influencing enrolment and renewal decisions. The quantitative synthesis (informed by meta-analysis) and the qualitative analysis (informed by thematic synthesis) were compared to gain insight for an overall synthesis of findings/statements.--NEW SECTION--Meta-analysis suggests that enrolments in CBHI were positively associated with household income, education and age of the household head (HHH), household size, female-headed household, married HHH and chronic illness episodes in the household. The thematic synthesis suggests the following factors as enablers for enrolment: (a) knowledge and understanding of insurance and CBHI, (b) quality of healthcare, (c) trust in scheme management. Factors found to be barriers to enrolment include: (a) inappropriate benefits package, (b) cultural beliefs, (c) affordability, (d) distance to healthcare facility, (e) lack of adequate legal and policy frameworks to support CBHI, and (f) stringent rules of some CBHI schemes. HHH education, household size and trust in the scheme management were positively associated with member renewal decisions. Other motivators were: (a) knowledge and understanding of insurance and CBHI, (b) healthcare quality, (c) trust in scheme management, and (d) receipt of an insurance payout the previous year. The barriers to renewal decisions were: (a) stringent rules of some CBHI schemes, (b) inadequate legal and policy frameworks to support CBHI and (c) inappropriate benefits package.--NEW SECTION--The demand-side factors positively affecting enrolment in CBHI include education, age, female household heads, and the socioeconomic status of households. Moreover, when individuals understand how their CBHI functions they are more likely to enroll and when people have a positive claims experience, they are more likely to renew. A higher prevalence of chronic conditions or the perception that healthcare is of good quality and nearby act as factors enhancing enrolment. The perception that services are distant or deficient leads to lower enrolments. The second insight is that trust in the scheme enables enrolment. Thirdly, clarity about the legal or policy framework acts as a factor influencing enrolments. This is significant, as it points to hitherto unpublished evidence that governments can effectively broaden their outreach to grassroots groups that are excluded from social protection by formulating supportive regulatory and policy provisions even if they cannot fund such schemes in full, by leveraging people's willingness to exercise voluntary and contributory enrolment in a community-based health insurance.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Responsible training and education is required to ensure healthcare providers are confident and skilled in the delivery of this care in both the rural and the urban setting. The Tropical Health and Education Trust (THET), a UK-based specialist global health organisation, is working with health training institutions, health professionals, Ministries of Health and Health Partnerships or 'links' between healthcare institutions in the UK and low- or middle-income country (LMIC) counterparts. These institutions may be hospitals, professional associations or universities whose primary focus is delivery of health services or the training and education of health workers. Since 2011, THET has been delivering the Health Partnership Scheme (HPS), a UK government-funded programme that provides grants and guidance to health partnerships and promotes the voluntary engagement of UK health professionals overseas. To date, the £30 million Scheme has supported peer-to-peer collaborations involving more than 200 UK and overseas hospitals, universities and professional associations across 25 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.--NEW SECTION--In this paper, we focus on four partnerships that are undertaking training initiatives focused on building capacity for surgery and anaesthesia. In order to do so, we discuss their role as a responsible and effective approach to harnessing the expertise available in the UK in order to increase surgical and anaesthesia capacity in LMICs. Specifically, how well they: (1) respond to locally identified needs; (2) are appropriate to the local context and are of high quality; and (3) have an overarching goal of making a sustainable contribution to the development of the health workforce through education and training.--NEW SECTION--The HPS has now supported 24 training initiatives focused on building capacity for surgery and anaesthesia in 16 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Middle East. THET argues that these initiatives are both responsible and effective. The four partnerships featured in this paper have demonstrated not only their effectiveness in increasing health worker skills and knowledge, but have done so across a variety of surgical and anaesthesia disciplines and within different contexts. This wide reach and applicability of partnership initiatives adds even greater value to their use as responsible training interventions. One challenge that has faced these partnerships has been the capture of improvements to patient outcomes as a result of improved practice. To counteract the problems of data collection, partnerships are collecting anecdotal evidence of improvements at the patient outcome level.--NEW SECTION--The interventions supported by THET have been able to demonstrate success in improving health worker skills and knowledge, and albeit to a lesser extent, in improving patient outcomes. The implementing partners are achieving these successes by training responsibly: responding to locally identified need, implementing projects that are appropriate to the local context and are of high quality, and establishing mechanisms that ensure self-sufficiency of the health worker training and education that is delivered. Greater investment in responsible training initiatives such as these are required to address the significant lack of access to appropriate and safe surgical and anaesthesia interventions when needed and the growing burden of disease.",eng,Tropical doctor,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

We evaluated the significance of neutrophilic CD64 (nCD64) expression as an early marker for diagnosis of NS compared to CRP and assessed its relation to disease outcome.--NEW SECTION--High sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and nCD64 were measured in 60 neonates with symptoms and signs of sepsis (40% were culture-proved) and 30 age- and sex-matched controls.--NEW SECTION--Baseline hs-CRP and nCD64% were significantly higher among septic neonates compared with the controls (p < 0.05), while, no significant difference was found between the two septic groups (p > 0.05). nCD64 cutoff value > 34.1% was able to discriminate septic neonates from controls with higher sensitivity and specificity than hs-CRP.

27577699,10.1159/000448706,Uniformity of Chronic Pain Assessment after Inguinal Hernia Repair: A Critical Review of the Literature.,"Chronic postoperative inguinal pain (CPIP) is the most common long-term complication of inguinal hernia repair. As such procedures are routinely performed, CPIP can be considered a significant burden to global health care. Therefore, adequate preventative measures relevant to surgical practice are investigated. However, as no gold standard research approach is currently available, study and outcome measures differ between studies. The current review aims to provide a qualitative analysis of the literature to seek out if outcomes of CPIP are valid and comparable, facilitating recommendations on the best approach to preventing CPIP.--NEW SECTION--A systematic review of recent studies investigating CPIP was performed, comprising studies published in 2007-2015. Study designs were analyzed regarding the CPIP definitions applied, the use of validated instruments, the availability of a baseline score, and the existence of a minimal follow-up of 12 months.--NEW SECTION--Eighty eligible studies were included. In 48 studies, 22 different definitions of CPIP were identified, of which the definition provided by the International Association for the Study of Pain was applied most often. Of the studies included, 53 (66%) used 33 different validated instruments to quantify CPIP. There were 32 studies (40%) that assessed both pain intensity (PI) and quality of life (QOL) with validated tools, 41% and 4% had a validated assessment of only PI or QOL, respectively, and 15% lacked a validated assessment. The visual analog scale and the Short Form 36 (SF36) were most commonly used for measuring PI (73%) and QOL (19%). Assessment of CPIP was unclear in 15% of the studies included. A baseline score was assessed in 45% of the studies, and 75% had a follow-up of at least 12 months.--NEW SECTION--The current literature addressing CPIP after inguinal hernia repair has a variable degree of quality and lacks uniformity in outcome measures. Proper comparison of the study results to provide conclusive recommendations for preventive measures against CPIP therefore remains difficult. These findings reaffirm the need for a uniform and validated assessment with uniform reporting of outcomes to improve the burden that CPIP poses to a significant surgical patient population.",eng,European surgical research.

This paper reviews studies analysing media coverage of non-communicable disease (NCD) debates, focusing on how the industries marketing commodities that increase NCD risk are represented.--NEW SECTION--A scoping review identified 61 studies providing information on media representations of NCD risks, NCD policies and tobacco, alcohol, processed food and soft drinks industries. The data were narratively synthesized to describe the sample, media depictions of industries, and corporate and public health attempts to frame the media debates.--NEW SECTION--The findings indicate that: (i) the limited research that has been undertaken is dominated by a focus on tobacco; (ii) comparative research across industries/risk-factors is particularly lacking; and (iii) coverage tends to be dominated by two contrasting frames and focuses either on individual responsibilities ('market justice' frames, often promoted by commercial stakeholders) or on the need for population-level interventions ('social justice' frames, frequently advanced by public health advocates).--NEW SECTION--Establishing the underlying frameworks is crucial for the analysis of media representation of corporations, as they reflect the strategies that respective actors use to influence public health debates and decision making. The potential utility of media research lies in the insights that it can provide for public health policy advocates about successful framing of public health messages and strategies to counter frames that undermine public health goals.

The goal of this review is to examine this era of protein malnutrition, the reasons for its demise, and the aftermath.--NEW SECTION--The UN Protein Advisory Group was established in 1955. International conferences were largely concerned about protein malnutrition in children. By the early 1970s, UN agencies were ringing the alarm about a 'protein gap'. In The Lancet in 1974, Donald McLaren branded these efforts as 'The Great Protein Fiasco', declaring that the 'protein gap' was a fallacy. The following year, John Waterlow, the scientist who led most of the efforts on protein malnutrition, admitted that a 'protein gap' did not exist and that young children in developing countries only needed sufficient energy intake. The emphasis on protein malnutrition waned. It is recently apparent that quality protein and essential amino acids are missing in the diet and may have adverse consequences for child growth and the reduction of child stunting.

27576538,10.1093/gbe/evw203,CRISPR Diversity and Microevolution in Clostridium difficile.,"Virulent strains of Clostridium difficile have become a global health problem associated with morbidity and mortality. Traditional typing methods do not provide ideal resolution to track outbreak strains, ascertain genetic diversity between isolates, or monitor the phylogeny of this species on a global basis. Here, we investigate the occurrence and diversity of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated genes (cas) in C. difficile to assess the potential of CRISPR-based phylogeny and high-resolution genotyping. A single Type-IB CRISPR-Cas system was identified in 217 analyzed genomes with cas gene clusters present at conserved chromosomal locations, suggesting vertical evolution of the system, assessing a total of 1,865 CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays, markedly enriched (8.5 arrays/genome) compared with other species, occur both at conserved and variable locations across strains, and thus provide a basis for typing based on locus occurrence and spacer polymorphism. Clustering of strains by array composition correlated with sequence type (ST) analysis. Spacer content and polymorphism within conserved CRISPR arrays revealed phylogenetic relationship across clades and within ST. Spacer polymorphisms of conserved arrays were instrumental for differentiating closely related strains, e.g., ST1/RT027/B1 strains and pathogenicity locus encoding ST3/RT001 strains. CRISPR spacers showed sequence similarity to phage sequences, which is consistent with the native role of CRISPR-Cas as adaptive immune systems in bacteria. Overall, CRISPR-Cas sequences constitute a valuable basis for genotyping of C. difficile isolates, provide insights into the micro-evolutionary events that occur between closely related strains, and reflect the evolutionary trajectory of these genomes.",eng,Genome biology and evolution,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, the considerations around how to attribute the cost for these biospecimens and data have, until recently, not been well described. Common across most biobank disciplines are similar factors that influence user fees such as capital and operating costs, internal and external demand, and market competition. A biospecimen user fee calculator tool developed by CTRNet, a tumor biobank network, was published in 2014 and is accessible online at www.biobanking.org . The next year a survey was launched that tested the applicability of this user fee tool among a global health research biobank user base, including both cancer and noncancer biobanking. Participants were first asked to estimate user fee pricing for three hypothetical user scenarios based on their biobanking experience (estimated pricing) and then to calculate fees for the same scenarios using the calculator tool (calculated pricing). Results demonstrated variation in estimated pricing that was reduced by calculated pricing. These results are similar to those found in a similar previous study restricted to a group of Canadian tumor biobanks. We conclude that the use of a biospecimen user fee calculator contributes to reduced variation of user fees and for biobank groups (e.g., biobank networks), could become an important part of a harmonization strategy.",eng,Biopreservation and biobanking,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017
27574733,10.1016/j.virusres.2016.08.010,Combination of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against Hepatitis C virus E2 protein effectively blocks virus infection.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a major global health threat. The envelope glycoproteins, E1-E2 of HCV play an important role in infection by binding to hepatocyte surface receptors leading to viral entry. Several regions on the E1-E2 are conserved for maintaining structural stability, despite the high mutation rate of HCV. Identification of antigenic determinants in these domains would aid in the development of anti-virals. The present study was aimed to delineate neutralizing epitopes by generating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to envelope proteins that can block virus binding and entry. Using HCV-like particles (HCV-LPs) corresponding to genotype 3a (prevalent in India), we obtained three mAbs specific for the E2 protein that significantly inhibited virus binding to hepatoma cells. Using overlapping protein fragments and peptides of the E2 protein, the epitopes corresponding to the mAbs were delineated. MAbs H6D3 and A10F2 recognise sequential linear epitopes, whereas, mAb E3D8 recognises a discontinuous epitope. The epitope of mAb E3D8 overlaps with the CD81 receptor-binding site and that of mAb A10F2 with the hypervariable region 2 of the E2 protein. The epitopes corresponding to these mAbs are distinct and unique. A combination of these antibodies significantly inhibited HCV binding and entry in both HCV pseudoparticle (in vitro) and HCV cell culture (ex vivo) system compared to the mAbs alone (P<0.0001). In conclusion, our findings support the potential of employing a cocktail of neutralizing mAbs in the management of HCV infection.",eng,Virus research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Women living in the catchment areas of the 26 health centers, who delivered a baby in the past 12 months, were randomly selected to complete a face-to-face survey about maternal health experiences.--NEW SECTION--The maternal package did not significantly affect the stillbirth or facility delivery rates. Women were positively influenced to deliver in a health facility if their husbands were involved in the decision concerning the place of birth and if they had prior maternal experience in the health center. Barriers to delivering in a health facility included distance and ability to read and write.--NEW SECTION--Women served by health centers with a maternal health package did not have significantly fewer stillbirths and were not more likely to deliver their babies in a health facility.

Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have the potential to improve continuity of care for slum residents, but their implementation is complicated by technical and non-technical limitations. This study sought practical insights about facilitators and barriers to EMR implementation in urban slum environments.--NEW SECTION--Descriptive qualitative method was used to explore staff perceptions about a recent open-source EMR deployment in two primary care clinics in Kibera, Nairobi. Participants were interviewed using open-ended, semi-structured questions. Content analysis was used when exploring transcribed data.--NEW SECTION--Three major themes - systems, software, and social considerations - emerged from content analysis, with sustainability concerns prevailing. Although participants reported many systems (e.g., power, network, Internet, hardware, interoperability) and software (e.g., data integrity, confidentiality, function) challenges, social factors (e.g., identity management, training, use incentives) appeared the most important impediments to sustainability.--NEW SECTION--These findings are consistent with what others have reported, especially the importance of practical barriers to EMR deployments in resource-constrained settings. Other findings contribute unique insights about social determinants of EMR impact in slum settings, including the challenge of multiple-identity management and development of meaningful incentives to staff compliance.--NEW SECTION--This study exposes front-line experiences with opportunities and shortcomings of EMR implementations in urban slum primary care clinics. Although the promise is great, there are a number of unique system, software and social challenges that EMR advocates should address before expecting sustainable EMR use in resource-constrained settings.",eng,International journal of medical informatics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Although much of their impact can be controlled by drug therapy as with prokaryotic microorganisms, the emergence of drug resistance has threatened these treatment efforts. Here, we discuss the challenges posed by eukaryotic microbial pathogens and how these are similar to, or differ from, the challenges of prokaryotic antibiotic resistance. The therapies used for several major eukaryotic microorganisms are then detailed, and the mechanisms that they have evolved to overcome these therapies are described. The rapid emergence of resistance and the restricted pipeline of new drug therapies pose considerable risks to global health and are particularly acute in the developing world. Nonetheless, we detail how the integration of new technology, biological understanding, epidemiology and evolutionary analysis can help sustain existing therapies, anticipate the emergence of resistance or optimize the deployment of new therapies.",eng,Nature microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

While the outbreak pattern may seemingly mirror those of other arboviruses, unique transmission characteristics and clinical outcomes warrant a different approach to traditional public health practices. Sexual transmission and virus-associated fetal and nonfetal neurologic disorders specifically challenge conventional methods of disease protection and prevention with regard to vector control, disease surveillance, and health risk communication. The protocols for outbreak and case limitation led by the World Health Organization (in accordance with Public Health Emergency of International Concern declaration) may be augmented by localized risk categorization and assignment for Zika and future emergent outbreaks. There is currently a great deal of ""behind the scenes"" discussion about modifications to the formal process described in the International Health Regulations.

27571972,10.1038/nmicrobiol.2015.4,Activation of band 3 mediates group A Streptococcus streptolysin S-based beta-haemolysis.,"Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a human bacterial pathogen that can manifest as a range of diseases from pharyngitis and impetigo to severe outcomes such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. GAS disease remains a global health burden with cases estimated at over 700 million annually and over half a million deaths due to severe infections(1). For over 100 years, a clinical hallmark of diagnosis has been the appearance of complete (beta) haemolysis when grown in the presence of blood. This activity is due to the production of a small peptide toxin by GAS known as streptolysin S. Although it has been widely held that streptolysin S exerts its lytic activity through membrane disruption, its exact mode of action has remained unknown. Here, we show, using high-resolution live cell imaging, that streptolysin S induces a dramatic osmotic change in red blood cells, leading to cell lysis. This osmotic change was characterized by the rapid influx of Cl(-) ions into the red blood cells through SLS-mediated disruption of the major erythrocyte anion exchange protein, band 3. Chemical inhibition of band 3 function significantly reduced the haemolytic activity of streptolysin S, and dramatically reduced the pathology in an in vivo skin model of GAS infection. These results provide key insights into the mechanism of streptolysin S-mediated haemolysis and have implications for the development of treatments against GAS.",eng,Nature microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Several studies have observed that consumption of dairy products has a protective role on the development of cardiovascular diseases; however, the scientific evidence on this topic is very limited among children and adolescents. Objectives: To investigate the association between dairy products consumption and cardiovascular risk factors in young populations. Material and methods: The most up-to-date literature was reviewed, including some data from the HELENA (Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence) study. A sample of adolescents (12.5-17.5 years) from 8 European cities was considered for the analysis. Results: US data showed a decrease in both number of servings and portion sizes of milk consumption. Within the HELENA study, dairy products emerged as the food group that better distinguished those adolescents at lower cardiovascular diseases risk. Among the HELENA adolescents, higher consumption of milk, yogurt and milk- and yogurt-based beverages was associated with lower body fat, lower risk for cardiovascular diseases, and higher cardiorespiratory fitness. Conclusions: More studies are needed to provide more evidence and to better understand the intrinsic mechanisms of the association between dairy products consumption, especially yogurt consumption, and obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular diseases risk factors.",spa,Nutricion hospitalaria,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27571742,10.1007/s10508-016-0816-1,Preferred Physical Characteristics of Vaginal Film Microbicides for HIV Prevention in Pittsburgh Women.,"Unprotected heterosexual intercourse is the leading cause of HIV acquisition in women. Due to the complex nature of correct and consistent condom use by both men and women, developing alternative female-controlled HIV prevention options is a global health priority. Vaginal films containing antiretroviral drugs are a potential delivery system for the prevention of HIV acquisition through sexual contact. In this study, we explored women's preferences regarding physical characteristics of microbicide vaginal films through questionnaires and focus groups. Eighty-four sexually active, ethnically diverse women 18-30 years of age from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, participated in the study. Women visually and manually examined a variety of vaginal films, as well as three other vaginal products undergoing evaluation for HIV prevention: tablet, ring, and gel. Means and standard deviations or frequencies and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for questionnaire data. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded for content analysis. Women most frequently preferred vaginal films to be smooth and thin (63 %), translucent (48 %), and 2″ × 2″ square size (36 %). Driving these preferences were five major themes: ease and accuracy of use, desire for efficacy, discretion, intravaginal comfort and minimal impact, and minimizing disruption of sexual mood/activities. Women's preferences for various microbicide vaginal film physical attributes represented a balance of multiple values. In general, women desired a comfortable, efficacious, easy to use, and minimally intrusive product.",eng,Archives of sexual behavior,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017
29928722,10.1016/j.idm.2016.08.001,Some models for epidemics of vector-transmitted diseases.,"Vector-transmitted diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya have been spreading rapidly in many parts of the world. The Zika virus has been known since 1947 and invaded South America in 2013. It can be transmitted not only by (mosquito) vectors but also directly through sexual contact. Zika has developed into a serious global health problem because, while most cases are asymptomatic or very light, babies born to Zika - infected mothers may develop microcephaly and other very serious birth defects. We formulate and analyze two epidemic models for vector-transmitted diseases, one appropriate for dengue and chikungunya fever outbreaks and one that includes direct transmission appropriate for Zika virus outbreaks. This is especially important because the Zika virus is the first example of a disease that can be spread both indirectly through a vector and directly (through sexual contact). In both cases, we obtain expressions for the basic reproduction number and show how to use the initial exponential growth rate to estimate the basic reproduction number. However, for the model that includes direct transmission some additional data would be needed to identify the fraction of cases transmitted directly. Data for the 2015 Zika virus outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia has been used to fit parameters to the model developed here and to estimate the basic reproduction number.",eng,Infectious Disease Modelling,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A pan-caspase inhibitor, emricasan, inhibited ZIKV-induced increases in caspase-3 activity and protected human cortical neural progenitors in both monolayer and three-dimensional organoid cultures. Ten structurally unrelated inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases inhibited ZIKV replication. Niclosamide, a category B anthelmintic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, also inhibited ZIKV replication. Finally, combination treatments using one compound from each category (neuroprotective and antiviral) further increased protection of human neural progenitors and astrocytes from ZIKV-induced cell death. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy and identify lead compounds for anti-ZIKV drug development.",eng,Nature medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Long-term excess fat accumulation leads to NAFLD and represents a global health problem with no effective therapeutic approach. NAFLD is considered to be a series of complex, multifaceted pathological processes involving oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism. Over the past decades, herbal medicines have garnered growing attention as potential therapeutic agents to prevent and treat NAFLD, due to their high efficacy and low risk of side effects. In this review, we evaluate the use of herbal medicines (including traditional Chinese herbal formulas, crude extracts from medicinal plants, and pure natural products) to treat NAFLD.

In the more recent period, survival has shown only minor improvement, despite significant advances in diagnostic techniques, surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches, the development of novel therapeutic agents and treatment by multidisciplinary teams. Because multiple genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations, and aberrant molecular signalling pathways are involved in the development of gastric cancers, recent research has attempted to determine the molecular heterogeneity responsible for the processes of carcinogenesis, spread and metastasis. Currently, some novel agents targeting a part of these dysfunctional molecular signalling pathways have already been integrated into the standard treatment of gastric cancer, whereas others remain in phases of investigation within clinical trials. It is essential to identify the unique molecular patterns of tumours and specific biomarkers to develop treatments targeted to the individual tumour behaviour. This review analyses the global impact of gastric cancer, as well as the role of Helicobacter pylori infection and the efficacy of bacterial eradication in preventing gastric cancer development.

This study aims to identify and understand the determinants of persistently low institutional birth in rural Nepal, with the goal of informing future interventions to reduce high rates of maternal mortality.--NEW SECTION--Postpartum women giving birth in the catchment area population of a district-level hospital in the Far-Western Development Region of Nepal were invited to complete a cross-sectional survey in 2012 about their recent birth experience. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to determine the institutional birth rate, social and demographic predictors of institutional birth, and barriers to institutional birth.--NEW SECTION--The institutional birth rate for the hospital's catchment area population was calculated to be 0.30 (54 home births, 23 facility births). Institutional birth was more likely as age decreased (ORs in the range of 0.20-0.28) and as income increased (ORs in the range of 1.38-1.45). Institutional birth among women who owned land was less likely (OR = 0.82 [0.71, 0.92]). Ninety percent of participants in the institutional birth group identified safety and good care as the most important factors determining location of birth, whereas 60 % of participants in the home birth group reported distance from hospital as a key determinant of location of birth. Qualitative analysis elucidated the importance of social support, financial resources, birth planning, awareness of services, perception of safety, and referral capacity in achieving an institutional birth.--NEW SECTION--Age, income, and land ownership, but not patient preference, were key predictors of institutional birth. Most women believed that birth at the hospital was safer regardless of where they gave birth. Future interventions to increase rates of institutional birth should address structural barriers including differences in socioeconomic status, social support, transportation resources, and birth preparedness.",eng,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

DENV consists of four distinct serotypes, necessitating a tetravalent vaccine. In this study, expression of consensus envelope protein domain III (cEDIII) fused to cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) in transgenic rice calli was improved using the luminal binding protein BiP at the N-terminus and the SEKDEL signal sequences at the C-terminus, targeting the recombinant protein to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that the fusion protein showed higher levels of expression when compared to the fusion proteins using rice amylase 3D (RAmy3D) or CTB native signal sequence only. The CTB-cEDIII fusion protein was evaluated as an oral dengue vaccine candidate in mice. Serotype specific systemic IgG antibodies and specific IgA response in feces were detected and furthermore, T cell proliferation and high frequency antibody-secreting B cells were detected in the spleen.

While poor data management have been occasionally excused, fabrication constitutes a cardinal sin - scientific misconduct. Scholarly examinations of fabrication usually seek to expose and capture its prevalence and, less frequently, its consequences and causes. Most accounts centre on high-income countries, individual senior researchers and scientists who are portrayed as irrational, immoral or deceptive. We argue that such accounts contain limitations in overlooking data collected in 'the field', in low-income countries, by junior researchers and non-scientists. Furthermore, the processes and motivations for fabrication and subversive practices are under-examined. Drawing on two separate ethnographies, conducted in 2004-2009 in medical research projects in sub-Saharan Africa, this paper investigates fabrication among fieldworkers using data from observations and informal conversations, 68 interviews and 7 Focus Group Discussions involving diverse stakeholders. Based on an interpretative approach, we examined fieldworkers' accounts that fabrications were motivated by irreconcilable moral concerns, faltering morale resulting from poor management, and inadequate institutional support. To fieldworkers, data fabrication constituted a 'tool' for managing their quotidian challenges. Fabrications ranged from active to passive acts, to subvert, resist and readdress tensions deriving from employment inequalities and challenging socio-economic conditions. We show that geographical and hierarchical distance between high-ranking research actors and fieldworkers in contemporary configurations of international medical research can compartmentalise, and ultimately undermine, the relationships necessary to produce high-quality data. In focusing on fieldworkers, we argue for the inclusion of wide-ranging perspectives in examinations of data fabrication.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Establishing a national reference laboratory, especially one with BSL-3 or -4 biocontainment facilities, requires a heavy investment of resources, a multisectoral approach, and commitments from multiple stakeholders. We make the case for donor organizations and recipient partners to develop a comprehensive laboratory operations roadmap that addresses factors such as mission and roles, engaging national and political support, securing financial support, defining stakeholder involvement, fostering partnerships, and building trust. Successful development occurred with projects in African countries and in Azerbaijan, where strong leadership and a clear management framework have been key to success. A clearly identified and agreed management framework facilitate identifying the responsibility for developing laboratory capabilities and support services, including biosafety and biosecurity, quality assurance, equipment maintenance, supply chain establishment, staff certification and training, retention of human resources, and sustainable operating revenue. These capabilities and support services pose rate-limiting yet necessary challenges. Laboratory capabilities depend on mission and role, as determined by all stakeholders, and demonstrate the need for relevant metrics to monitor the success of the laboratory, including support for internal and external audits. Our analysis concludes that alternative frameworks for success exist for developing and implementing capabilities at regional and national levels in limited resource areas.

In order to reduce the empiric use of antimicrobial drugs and improve outcomes, it is essential to improve diagnostic capabilities. In the absence of microbiology facilities in low-income settings, an assay to distinguish bacterial from non-bacterial causes would be a critical first step. To ensure that patient and market needs are met, the requirements of such a test should be specified in a target product profile (TPP). To identify minimal/optimal characteristics for a bacterial vs. non-bacterial fever test, experts from academia and international organizations with expertise in infectious diseases, diagnostic test development, laboratory medicine, global health, and health economics were convened. Proposed TPPs were reviewed by this working group, and consensus characteristics were defined. The working group defined non-severely ill, non-malaria infected children as the target population for the desired assay. To provide access to the most patients, the test should be deployable to community health centers and informal health settings, and staff should require <2 days of training to perform the assay. Further, given that the aim is to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use as well as to deliver appropriate treatment for patients with bacterial infections, the group agreed on minimal diagnostic performance requirements of >90% and >80% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Other key characteristics, to account for the challenging environment at which the test is targeted, included: i) time-to-result <10 min (but maximally <2 hrs); ii) storage conditions at 0-40°C, ≤90% non-condensing humidity with a minimal shelf life of 12 months; iii) operational conditions of 5-40°C, ≤90% non-condensing humidity; and iv) minimal sample collection needs (50-100μL, capillary blood).

Understanding decisions about whether or not to disclose violence in response to routine enquiry in health settings can inform safe and responsive systems. Elevated rates of violence and systematic disadvantage found among Indigenous women globally, can impact on their decisions to disclose violence. This study aimed to test, among Indigenous women, a model for decisions on whether to disclose intimate partner violence in the context of antenatal routine screening.--NEW SECTION--we employed Qualitative Configurative Analysis, a method developed for the social sciences to study complex phenomena with intermediate sample sizes. Data were drawn from single semi- structured interviews with Indigenous women 28+ weeks pregnant attending antenatal care. Interviews addressed decisions to disclose recent intimate partner violence in the context of routine enquiry during the antenatal care. Interview transcripts were binary coded for conditions identified a priori from the model being tested and also from themes identified within the current study and analysed using Qualitative Configurative Analysis to determine causal conditions for the outcome of disclosure or non-disclosure of violence experienced.--NEW SECTION--five Aboriginal and Maternal Infant Health Services (two urban and three regional), and one mainstream hospital, in New South Wales, Australia.--NEW SECTION--indigenous women who had experienced partner violence in the previous year and who had been asked about this as part of an antenatal booking-in visit. Of the 12 participants six had elected to disclose their experience of violence to the midwife, and six had chosen not to do so.--NEW SECTION--pathways to disclosure and non-disclosure were mapped using Qualitative Configurative Analysis. Conditions relevant to decisions to disclose were similar to the conditions for non-Aboriginal women found in our earlier study. Unique to Aboriginal women's decisions to disclose abuse was cultural safety. Cultural safety included elements we titled: Borrowed trust, Build the relationship first, Come at it slowly and People like me are here. The absence of cultural safety Its absence was also a factor in decisions not to disclose experiences of violence by this group of women.--NEW SECTION--cultural safety was central to Indigenous women's decision to disclose violence and processes for creating safety are identified. Other forms of safety which influenced disclosure included: safety from detection by the abuser; safety from shame; and safety from institutional control. Disclosure was promoted by direct asking by the midwife and a perception of care. Non-disclosure was associated with a lack of care and a lack of all four types of safety. Experiences of institutional racism were associated with Indigenous women's perceived risk of control by others, particularly child protection services.--NEW SECTION--policies to ask abuse questions at first visits and models where continuity of care is not maintained, are problematic for Aboriginal women, among whom relationship building is important as is ample warning about questions to be asked. Strategies are needed to build cultural safety to counter widespread racism and promote safe opportunities for Indigenous women to disclose intimate partner violence and receive support. Elements of cultural safety are necessary for vulnerable or marginalised populations to fully utilise available health services.",eng,Midwifery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

To improve timely patient care and expand provider scope of practice, nations leverage cellular phones and call centers for real-time online medical direction. However, there exist several barriers to adequate communication that impact the provision of emergency care. We sought to identify obstacles in the cellular communication process among GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (GVK EMRI) EMTs in Gujarat, India.--NEW SECTION--A convenience sample of practicing EMTs in Gujarat, India were surveyed regarding the barriers to call initiation and completion.--NEW SECTION--108 EMTs completed the survey. Overall, ninety-seven (89.8%) EMTs responded that the most common reason they did not initiate a call with the call center physician was insufficient time. Forty-six (42%) EMTs reported that they were unable to call the physician one or more times during a typical workweek (approximately 5-6 twelve-hour shifts/week) due to their hands being occupied performing direct patient care. Fifty-eight (54%) EMTs reported that they were unable to reach the call center physician, despite attempts, at least once a week.--NEW SECTION--This study identified multiple barriers to communication, including insufficient time to call for advice and inability to reach call center physicians.

There is increasing recognition that pain, particularly chronic pain, represents a global health burden. Many studies, including two national surveys exploring the content of undergraduate curricula for pain education, identify that documented pain education in curricula was limited and fragmentary.--NEW SECTION--The study design used a questionnaire which included an open text comment box for respondents to add 'further comments' as part of larger study previously published. The sample consisted of 19 UK universities that offered 108 undergraduate programmes in the following: dentistry, medicine, midwifery, nursing (adult, child, learning disabilities and mental health branches), occupational therapy (OT), pharmacy, physiotherapy and veterinary science. An inductive content analysis was performed, and the data were managed using NVivo 10 software for data management.--NEW SECTION--A total of 57 participants across seven disciplines (dentistry, medicine, midwifery, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy and OT) completed the open text comment box (none were received from veterinary science). Analysis revealed two major themes of successes and challenges. Successes included expansion (extending coverage and/or increased student access), multidimensional curriculum content and diversity of teaching methods. Challenges included difficulties in identifying where pain is taught in the curriculum, biomedical versus biopsychosocial definitions of pain, perceived importance, time, resources and staff knowledge, and finally a diffusion of responsibility for pain education.--NEW SECTION--This study identifies new insights of the factors attributed to successful implementation of pain education in undergraduate education. Many of the challenges previously reported were also identified. This is one of the first studies to identify a broad range of approaches, for pain education, that could be deemed as 'successful' across a range of health disciplines.",eng,British journal of pain,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Its diagnosis and treatment remain a challenge with the poor evidence base for interventional procedures. Patients with SIJ pain experience a low quality of life, worse than some of the chronic health conditions. Simplicity radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy is a novel technique which tackles some of the problems faced by conventional RF neurotomy and may offer better results in managing pain arising from SIJ.--NEW SECTION--The purpose of this retrospective review of practice was to look into the effectiveness of Simplicity RF neurotomy in terms of pain relief, quality of health improvement in patients suffering from SIJ pain and complications associated with the procedure.--NEW SECTION--Retrospective review of the patients undergoing Simplicity RF neurotomy at a tertiary hospital (April 2012 to June 2013). Pain scores and responses to SF (Short Form) 12 questionnaire before and at 12 months after treatment were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.--NEW SECTION--Out of 26 patients, 16 were considered for analysis. There was statistically significant reduction in both mean pain score (Numerical Rating Scale, NRS from 8.8 pre-intervention to 4.3 post-intervention) and median pain score (NRS from 9 pre-intervention to 5 post-intervention) with a p-value of <0.001 at 12 months. Reduction in the inter-quartile range of pain score was observed from 8-10 to 2.25-6 (p-value of <0.001). Global health as per SF12 scores showed statistically significant improvement, except in some of the psychological subcategories.

Specific objectives were to explore the composition of manual handling risk assessments and interventions in osteoporosis.--NEW SECTION--Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease that reduces bone density and causes increased fracture risk. Incidence rises with age and osteoporotic fractures cause increased morbidity and mortality. It is a major global health problem. In the UK older hospitalised adults are normally screened for falls risk but not necessarily for osteoporosis. As presentation of osteoporosis is normally silent until fractures are evident, it is frequently undiagnosed. Healthcare staff's knowledge of osteoporosis is often suboptimal and specific manual handling implications are under-researched.--NEW SECTION--An exploratory qualitative content analysis research design informed by critical realism.--NEW SECTION--The purposive sample comprised 26 nursing and allied health professionals. Semi-structured interviews addressed topics including knowledge of osteoporosis, implications for acute care, moving and handling and clinical guidelines. Qualitative content data analysis was used.--NEW SECTION--Awareness of osteoporosis prevalence in older populations varies and implications for nursing are indistinct to nonspecialists. In-hospital fractures potentially linked to suboptimal moving and handling seemed rare, but prospective studies are needed. Categories of 'Understanding moving and handling as routine care or as a healthcare intervention', with further categories 'healthcare practitioners' capacities and capabilities for dealing with people with osteoporosis' and 'the structural and organisational context for moving and handling' are reported alongside safety, frailty and dependency dimensions.--NEW SECTION--This study informs moving and handling in higher risk groups such as osteoporosis. Clinical knowledge/expertise is required when adapting generic manual handling guidelines to specific patients/contexts. Patients' experiences of moving and handling have received limited attention.--NEW SECTION--Increased focus on musculoskeletal conditions and moving and handling implications is required.",eng,Journal of clinical nursing,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, there are few methods currently available to prevent and no method to date that cures human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or combinations of STIs. While current oral and topical preexposure prophylaxes have protected against HIV infection, they have primarily relied on antiretrovirals (ARVs) to inhibit infection. Yet continued challenges with ARVs include user adherence to daily treatment regimens and the potential toxicity and antiviral resistance associated with chronic use. The integration of new biological agents may avert some of these adverse effects while also providing new mechanisms to prevent infection. Of the biologic-based antivirals, griffithsin (GRFT) has demonstrated potent inhibition of HIV-1 (and a multitude of other viruses) by adhering to and inactivating HIV-1 immediately upon contact. In parallel with the development of GRFT, electrospun fibers (EFs) have emerged as a promising platform for the delivery of agents active against HIV infection. In the study described here, our goal was to extend the mechanistic diversity of active agents and electrospun fibers by incorporating the biologic GRFT on the EF surface rather than within the EFs to inactivate HIV prior to cellular entry. We fabricated and characterized GRFT-modified EFs (GRFT-EFs) with different surface modification densities of GRFT and demonstrated their safety and efficacy against HIV-1 infection in vitro We believe that EFs are a unique platform that may be enhanced by incorporation of additional antiviral agents to prevent STIs via multiple mechanisms.",eng,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

And two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) has been reported very useful in evaluating left atrial (LA) function, as well as left ventricular (LV) function. The aim of our study is to evaluate the LA function in patients with IDA by 2D-STE.--NEW SECTION--65 patients with IDA were selected. This group of patients was then divided into two groups according to the degree of hemoglobin: group B (Hb > 90 g/L) and group C (Hb60 ~ 90 g/L). Another 30 healthy people were also selected as control group A. Conventional echocardiography parameters, such as left atrial diameter (LAD), peak E and A of mitralis (E, A), E/A, end-diastolic thickness of ventricular septum (IVST d), end-diastolic thickness of LV posterior wall (PWTd) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd) were obtained from these three groups. Left atrial minimum volume (LAVmin), left atrial pre-atrial contraction volume (LAVp) and left atrial maximum volume (LAVmax) were measured by Simpson's rule, whereas left atrial active ejection fraction (LAAEF) and left atrial passive ejection fraction (LAPEF) were obtained from calculation. Two-dimensional images were acquired from apical four-chamber view and two-chamber view to store images for offline analysis. The global peak atrial longitudinal strain and strain rate of systolic LV (GLSs, GLSRs) as well as early and late diastolic LV strain rate (GLSRe, GLSRa) curves of LA were acquired in each LA segment from basal segment to top segment of LA by 2D-STE.--NEW SECTION--Compared with group A, there were no differences between group B and group A (all P > 0.05). The LAAEF and GLSRa were significantly higher in group C compared with those of group A and group B (all P < 0.01).

Largely, residency education has lagged behind in addressing this demand. Time and curriculum requirements make meeting this need challenging. The Office of International Activities (OIA) at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) was founded to provide support to students and residents in the area global health. In order to more fully understand resident physicians' attitudes and educational needs, a survey of incoming residents was undertaken.--NEW SECTION--The OIA administered a survey for incoming first-year residents of all specialties in July 2012. The survey was administered over one month using Qualtrics® and the response rate was 60%.--NEW SECTION--Although 42% of residents had had an international experience during medical school, only 36% reported they felt prepared to address issues of international public health, including travel medicine and immigrant health. Significant barriers to involvement in global health opportunities in residency education were identified, including lack of time, finances and mentorship.--NEW SECTION--As has been previously documented for global health education for medical students, this study's residents saw significant barriers to international electives during residency, including lack of elective time, finances and family responsibilities. In response to the survey results, an interdisciplinary educational initiative was developed at our school. This included obtaining buy-in from core residency leadership, establishing a pathway to arrange experiences, competitive scholarships for travel, and initiation of interdisciplinary educational opportunities.

Pyrethroid resistant Anopheline mosquitoes are now ubiquitous in Africa, though the public health impact remains unclear, impeding the deployment of more expensive nets. Meta-analyses of bioassay studies and experimental hut trials are used to characterise how pyrethroid resistance changes the efficacy of standard bednets, and those containing the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), and assess its impact on malaria control. New bednets provide substantial personal protection until high levels of resistance, though protection may wane faster against more resistant mosquito populations as nets age. Transmission dynamics models indicate that even low levels of resistance would increase the incidence of malaria due to reduced mosquito mortality and lower overall community protection over the life-time of the net. Switching to PBO bednets could avert up to 0.5 clinical cases per person per year in some resistance scenarios.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Drug-resistant variants were selected and these carried a P34S substitution in non-structural protein 1 (nsP1), the main enzyme involved in alphavirus RNA capping. Biochemical assays using nsP1 of the related Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus revealed that the compounds specifically inhibit the guanylylation of nsP1. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report demonstrating that the alphavirus capping machinery is an excellent antiviral drug target.

Several studies have shown that ZIKV can infect neural stem cells in the developing brain, but infection in the adult brain has not been examined. Two areas in the adult mouse brain contain neural stem cells: the subventricular zone of the anterior forebrain and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. Here, using 6-week-old mice triply deficient in interferon regulatory factor (IRF) as a model, we show that blood-borne ZIKV administration can lead to pronounced evidence of ZIKV infection in these adult neural stem cells, leading to cell death and reduced proliferation. Our data therefore suggest that adult as well as fetal neural stem cells are vulnerable to ZIKV neuropathology.

It considers maternal and neonatal mortality, two high-burden issues that pertain to groups at risk at birth and whose lives could be saved with effective intrapartum care. Why did maternal survival gain status as a global health priority earlier and to a greater degree than newborn survival? Higher mortality and morbidity burdens among newborns and the cost-effectiveness of interventions would seem to predict that issue's earlier and higher prioritization. Yet maternal survival emerged as a priority two decades earlier and had attracted considerably more attention and resources by the close of the Millennium Development Goals era. This study uses replicative process-tracing case studies to examine the emergence and growth of political priority for these two issues, probing reasons for unexpected variance. The study finds that maternal survival's grounding as a social justice issue spurred growth of a strong and diverse advocacy network and aligned the issue with powerful international norms (e.g. expectations to advance women's rights and the Millennium Development Goals), drawing attention and resources to the issue over three decades. Newborn survival's disadvantage stems from its long status as an issue falling under the umbrellas of maternal and child survival but not fully adopted by these networks, and with limited appeal as a public health issue advanced by a small and technically focused network; network expansion and alignment with child survival norms have improved the issue's status in the past few years.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Concurrently, they have the lowest number of physicians. Innovative methods such as the exchange of health-related information using mobile devices (mHealth) may support health care workers in the provision of antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in LMICs.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of mHealth interventions targeting health care workers to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in LMIC.--NEW SECTION--The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Global Health Library, and Popline were searched using predetermined search and indexing terms. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. A strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat analysis was performed for each included paper.--NEW SECTION--A total of 19 studies were included for this systematic review, 10 intervention and 9 descriptive studies. mHealth interventions were used as communication, data collection, or educational tool by health care providers primarily at the community level in the provision of antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care. Interventions were used to track pregnant women to improve antenatal and delivery care, as well as facilitate referrals. None of the studies directly assessed the effect of mHealth on maternal and neonatal mortality. Challenges of mHealth interventions to assist health care workers consisted mainly of technical problems, such as mobile network coverage, internet access, electricity access, and maintenance of mobile phones.--NEW SECTION--mHealth interventions targeting health care workers have the potential to improve maternal and neonatal health services in LMICs. However, there is a gap in the knowledge whether mHealth interventions directly affect maternal and neonatal outcomes and future research should employ experimental designs with relevant outcome measures to address this gap.",eng,Journal of medical Internet research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, the global burden of HEV outbreak has not been comprehensively described. We performed a systematic review of confirmed HEV outbreaks based on published literatures. HEV outbreaks have mainly been reported from Asian and African countries, and only a few from European and American countries. India represents a country with the highest number of reported HEV outbreaks. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 were responsible for most of the large outbreaks in developing countries. During the outbreaks in developing countries, a significantly higher case fatality rate was observed in pregnant women. In fact, outbreaks have occurred both in open and closed populations. The control measures mainly depend upon improvement of sanitation and hygiene. This study highlights that HEV outbreak is not new, yet it is a continuous global health problem.",eng,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Clinical guidance tools and checklists have been used to improve health outcomes and standardize care. This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of a clinical guidance tool designed to improve outcomes for children hospitalized with severe pneumonia in Zambia.--NEW SECTION--This study was conducted at University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia from October 10, 2011 to March 21, 2014 among children 1 month to 5 years of age with severe pneumonia. In March 2013, a clinical guidance tool was implemented to standardize and improve care. In-hospital mortality pre-and post-implementation was compared.--NEW SECTION--Four hundred forty-three children were enrolled in the pre-intervention period and 250 in the post-intervention period. Overall, 18.2 % of children died during hospitalization, with 44 % of deaths occurring within the first 24 h after admission. Mortality was associated with HIV infection status, pneumonia severity, and weight-for-height z-score. Despite improving and standardizing the care received, the clinical guidance tool did not significantly reduce mortality (relative risk: 0.89; 95 % CI: 0.65, 1.23). The tool appeared to be more effective among HIV-exposed but uninfected children and children younger than 6 months of age.--NEW SECTION--Simple tools are needed to ensure that children hospitalized with pneumonia receive the best possible care in accordance with recommended guidelines. The clinical guidance tool was well-accepted and easy to use and succeeded in standardizing and improving care. Further research is needed to determine if similar interventions can improve treatment outcomes and should be implemented on a larger scale.",eng,BMC pediatrics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Data were summarised as forest plots and narrative synthesis.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-two studies (three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), four prospective cohort studies, nine retrospective cohort studies, five case controls and one natural experiment) were included with all but one study being carried out in higher-income countries. Seven of the 16 studies reporting on PTB found a statistically significant reduction in PTB rates between adolescent-specific prenatal care (intervention) and non-age specific prenatal care odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) ranged from OR: 0.15 (95% CI: 0.03-0.83) to OR: 0.59 (95% CI: 0.45-0.78). Nine of the 12 studies reported statistically significant higher mean prenatal attendance rates among the intervention group compared to controls (ranging from a mean number of visits of 14.3 vs. 10.7 p<0.001 to 10.8 vs. 7.6 visits p<0.001). The type and construct of the interventions, their implementation and local population differed sufficiently that a statistical synthesis was deemed inappropriate.--NEW SECTION--There is some evidence that adolescent-specific programs can increase prenatal attendance and reduce the risk of PTB and low birth rate but their effect on perinatal death is uncertain. There is a distinct lack of evidence of the effectiveness of these interventions for adolescents living in low-middle income countries, despite having the majority of adolescent pregnancies, and associated risk of harm. No high-quality intervention studies were identified. Robust, cluster-based RCTs are an urgent necessity to quantify the impact of these interventions and to identify factors contributing to their success.",eng,International journal of adolescent medicine and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27541998,10.1007/s00203-016-1278-5,Lysobacter species: a potential source of novel antibiotics.,"Infectious diseases threaten global health due to the ability of microbes to acquire resistance against clinically used antibiotics. Continuous discovery of antibiotics with a novel mode of action is thus required. Actinomycetes and fungi are currently the major sources of antibiotics, but the decreasing rate of discovery of novel antibiotics suggests that the focus should be changed to previously untapped groups of microbes. Lysobacter species have a genome size of ~6 Mb with a relatively high G + C content of 61-70 % and are characterized by their ability to produce peptides that damage the cell walls or membranes of other microbes. Genome sequence analysis revealed that each Lysobacter species has gene clusters for the production of 12-16 secondary metabolites, most of which are peptides, thus making them 'peptide production specialists'. Given that the number of antibiotics isolated is much lower than the number of gene clusters harbored, further intensive studies of Lysobacter are likely to unearth novel antibiotics with profound biomedical applications. In this review, we summarize the structural diversity, activity and biosynthesis of lysobacterial antibiotics and highlight the importance of Lysobacter species for antibiotic production.",eng,Archives of microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Despite the availability of psychological testing, neuroimaging, genetic testing, and biochemical assays of cerebrospinal fluid, convenient and accurate blood biomarkers for the prediction, diagnosis, and preclinical studies of AD are still lacking. The present study aims to longitudinally evaluate the feasibility of β-amyloid proteins, α2-macroglobulin (α-2M), complement factor H (CFH), and clusterin as blood biomarkers of AD. Using APP/PS1 transgenic and wild-type mice, cognitive impairment and amyloid plaque counts in the brain were evaluated over a range of ages using the Morris water maze test and immunohistochemistry methods, respectively. Serum Aβ40, Aβ42, α-2M, CFH, and clusterin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and correlated with progression of AD. APP/PS1 transgenic mice presented progressive AD characteristics at the ages of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Serum Aβ42 levels and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios increased significantly in transgenic 3- and 6-month-old mice compared with controls. Serum CFH levels decreased significantly in 3- and 6-month-old transgenic mice compared with controls. Meanwhile, serum clusterin levels increased significantly in 12-month-old transgenic mice compared with controls. The α-2M level was not significantly different between transgenic and wild-type mice. The APP/PS1 transgenic mouse is a model of familial AD. The present study indicated that the serum Aβ42 level, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, and CFH level are potential biomarkers in preclinical and early stages of AD, whereas serum clusterin level is a potential biomarker in the late stage of AD.",eng,Neuroreport,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Since July 2011, CARE has been implementing the Supporting Access to Family Planning and Post-Abortion Care (SAFPAC) initiative to increase the availability, quality, and use of contraception, with a particular focus on highly effective and long-acting reversible methods-intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants-in crisis-affected settings in Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This initiative supports government health systems at primary and referral levels to provide a wide range of contraceptive services to people affected by conflict and/or displacement. Before the initiative, long-acting reversible methods were either unknown or unavailable in the intervention areas. However, as soon as trained providers were in place, we noted a dramatic and sustained increase in new users of all contraceptive methods, especially implants, with total new clients reaching 82,855, or 32% of the estimated number of women of reproductive age in the respective catchment areas in both countries, at the end of the fourth year. Demand for implants was very strong in the first 6 months after provider training. During this time, implants consistently accounted for more than 50% of the method mix, reaching as high as 89% in Chad and 74% in DRC. To ensure that all clients were getting the contraceptive method of their choice, we conducted a series of discussions and sought feedback from different stakeholders in order to modify program strategies. Key program modifications included more focused communication in mass media, community, and interpersonal channels about the benefits of IUDs while reinforcing the wide range of methods available and refresher training for providers on how to insert IUDs to strengthen their competence and confidence. Over time, we noted a gradual redistribution of the method mix in parallel with vigorous continued family planning uptake. This experience suggests that analyzing method mix can be helpful for designing program strategies and that expanding method choice can accelerate satisfying demand, especially in environments with high unmet need for contraception.",eng,"Global health, science and practice",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the lipid metabolic disorders in SCH have not been fully clarified. Additionally, progress in elucidating the exact pathogenesis of SCH has been hampered by the lack of optimized mouse models. Methimazole (MMI) was applied to construct a noninvasive SCH mouse model. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were administrated MMI through the drinking water. After 12 weeks, the MMI-treated mice showed the diagnostic criteria for SCH: increased serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels with constant thyroid hormone levels that persisted for approximately 8 weeks. Notably, SCH mice presented evident lipid metabolic disturbances, including dyslipidemia and hepatic lipid accumulation. Further analysis showed that hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) was induced in the SCH mice or by the elevation of TSH in vitro, likely via the IRE1α/XBP-1 pathway. Interestingly, when we used 4-phenyl butyric acid to repress ER stress in SCH mice for 4 weeks, dyslipidemia and hepatic lipid accumulation were both significantly alleviated. Our findings indicate that an optimized SCH mouse model could be established using MMI, and ER stress may play a pivotal role in the lipid metabolic abnormalities in SCH.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Furthermore, effect moderators are rarely reported. Therefore, we report the effects of the 3-month BEAT Cancer physical activity behavior change intervention on global health status and health indicators along with moderators of intervention outcomes. Postprimary treatment breast cancer survivors (n = 222) were randomized to BEAT Cancer or usual care (UC). SF-36, muscle strength, body mass index, lower extremity dysfunction (WOMAC), and life satisfaction were measured at 3 months (M3) and 6 months (M6). At M3, adjusted linear mixed-model analyses demonstrated statistically significant effects of BEAT Cancer versus UC on SF-36 physical health [mean between-group difference (M) = 2.1; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.3-3.9; p = 0.023], SF-36 mental health (M = 5.2; CI 2.8-7.6; p < 0.001), and all SF-36 subscores. Intervention benefits occurred for lower extremity physical dysfunction (M = -2.7; CI -5.0 to -0.5; p = 0.018), WOMAC total (M = -3.7; CI -6.7 to -0.6; p = 0.018), and life satisfaction (M = 2.4; CI 0.9-3.9; p = 0.001). Statistically significant effects persisted at M6 for mental health and vitality. Baseline value, income, marital status, cancer treatment, cancer stage, and months since diagnosis moderated one or more outcomes.

The mycobacterial cell wall is an attractive target for chemotherapeutic agents. Gene products of mymA operon are known to be required for the maintenance of cell wall and play an important role in persistence, thus making them important drug targets. This study was undertaken to biochemically characterize the MymA as a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO). Our results established its enzymatic activity in vitro and found that the mycobacterial FMO requires NADPH and FAD as cofactors, similar to other characterized bacterial FMOs. The enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics to catalyze substrates such as trimethylamine and thiourea. We also propose that MymA could be one of the targets of the antituberculosis drug, isoniazid (INH), which is a cell wall inhibitor. Molecular docking studies revealed that INH targeted NADPH-binding site of the MymA. Further, experimental validation revealed that INH inhibits MymA with the IC50 value of 4.9 μm. Thus, this study characterizes for the first time that MymA is a mycobacterial FMO, which may be a target of INH.",eng,Chemical biology & drug design,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Epidemiological and molecular evidence links obesity and metabolic status with inflammation and increased risk of cancer. Here, using a mouse model of intestinal neoplasia and strains that are susceptible or resistant to diet-induced obesity, it is demonstrated that high-fat diet-induced inflammation, rather than obesity or metabolic status, is associated with increased intestinal neoplasia. The complement fragment C5a acts as the trigger for inflammation and intestinal tumorigenesis. High-fat diet induces complement activation and generation of C5a, which in turn induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and expression of proto-oncogenes. Pharmacological and genetic targeting of the C5a receptor reduced both inflammation and intestinal polyposis, suggesting the use of complement inhibitors for preventing diet-induced neoplasia.--NEW SECTION--This study characterizes the relations between diet and metabolic conditions on risk for a common cancer and identifies complement activation as a novel target for cancer prevention.

Previous studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between levels of HIV knowledge with its prevalence. However, for Bangladesh such evidence is non-existent. In this study, we aimed to explore the extent of HIV knowledge in relation to the socio-demographic variables such as age, region, area of residence i.e., urban or rural, wealth index and education, and investigate the factors influencing the level of HIV knowledge among Bangladeshi women.--NEW SECTION--We used data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) survey conducted in 2011. In total 12,512 women ageing between 15 and 49 ever hearing about HIV regardless of HIV status were selected for this study. HIV knowledge level was estimated by analyzing respondents' answers to a set of 11 basic questions indicative of general awareness and mode of transmission. Descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation and multinominal logistic regression were performed for data analysis.--NEW SECTION--Little over half the respondents had good knowledge regarding HIV transmission risks. The mean HIV knowledge score was -0.001 (SD 0.914). Average correct response rate about mode of transmission was higher than for general awareness. Educational level of women and sex of household head were found to be significantly associated with HIV knowledge in the high score group. Those with no education, primary education or secondary education were less likely to be in the high score group for HIV knowledge when compared with those with higher than secondary level of education. Similarly those with male as household head were less likely to be in the higher score group for HIV knowledge.--NEW SECTION--Level of HIV knowledge among Bangladeshi women is quite low, and the limiting factors are rooted in various demographic and household characteristics. Education and sex of the household head have been found to be significantly correlated with the level of HIV knowledge and propound sound grounds for their incorporation in the future HIV prevention strategies.

Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is becoming a global health concern because it is a progressive disease associated with major health complications and increased health costs. The treatment goals for DKD are to slow the progression of the renal disease and prevent cardiovascular events. Accordingly, patients are expected to adhere to prescribed treatments and manage a wide range of daily self-care activities. Multidisciplinary management of chronic diseases, like diabetes and kidney disease, has been suggested as a means to improve patients' adherence to treatment and enhance health-related outcomes. This systematic review of multidisciplinary management of DKD is an important step in evaluating if such a management approach is effective in delaying disease progression.--NEW SECTION--The goal of this systematic review was to identify the best available evidence regarding multidisciplinary management of DKD and to determine if a multidisciplinary management of DKD can improve patient outcomes. Specifically the review question was: What is the impact of multidisciplinary management of DKD on patient outcomes?--NEW SECTION--The current review considered adults aged 18 years and older who had been diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.--NEW SECTION--The current review examined studies that compared multidisciplinary interventions with usual standard care in ambulatory settings for patients with DKD.--NEW SECTION--The current review considered studies with the following primary outcomes: kidney function, incidence of kidney failure, generic or specific health-related quality of life, patient self-care abilities, adherence to treatment recommendations or goals; and the following secondary clinical outcomes: mortality rates secondary to DKD, glycemic control, blood pressure (BP) control, lipid profile, incidence of cardiovascular disease/events, patient knowledge on diabetes or DKD, patient empowerment or self-efficacy, generic or specific patient satisfaction with care and patient healthcare utilization.--NEW SECTION--The current review will consider randomized and quasi-experimental trials but included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs).--NEW SECTION--A three-step search strategy was utilized starting with a search of MEDLINE and CINAHL for the identification of keywords, followed by a search using keywords and index terms across MEDLINE, CINAHL and Embase databases and clinical trials registry platforms, and finally a search of the reference list of all identified papers. Studies published from the time of the respective database inception to November 2014 in English, German and French were considered.--NEW SECTION--Two independent reviewers assessed the methodological validity of the papers prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI).--NEW SECTION--Data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-MAStARI.--NEW SECTION--Quantitative data were pooled using the RevMan 5 software for kidney function using estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), glycated hemoglobin, BP and total cholesterol (TC). Results were considered significant for P < 0.05.--NEW SECTION--Three RCTs were included in this review. Meta-analysis showed that multidisciplinary management was associated with a statistically significant improvement of glycated hemoglobin as compared with standard usual care (Relative Risk [RR] -0.49, at 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.83, -0.16, P < 0.01). The meta-analysis for eGFR showed a tendency to favor standard care; however, this finding cannot be conclusive because the CI was too wide (RR -3.30, at 95% CI -6.55, -0.05, P = 0.05). Meta-analysis results for BP and TC failed to show a difference between the multidisciplinary management of DKD and the usual standard care. Only one study measured patient-oriented primary and secondary outcomes and showed an improvement in health-related quality of life, patient self-care abilities, patient level of knowledge on diabetes and exercise self-efficacy.--NEW SECTION--Multidisciplinary management of DKD has the potential for improving glycemic control and thus preventing complications.

This paper presents the research protocol for the Performance ImprovEment of CHWs in Emergency Settings (PIECES) research programme. Enhancing Learning and Research in Humanitarian Action (ELRHA) funded the development of this protocol as part of their Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC) call (No.19839). PIECES aims to understand what factors improve the performance of CHWs in level III humanitarian emergencies.--NEW SECTION--The suggested protocol uses a realist evaluation with multiple cases across the 3 country sites: Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon. Working with International Medical Corps (IMC), an initial programme theory was elicited through literature and document reviews, semistructured interviews and focus groups with IMC programme managers and CHWs. Based on this initial theory, this protocol proposes a combination of semistructured interviews, life histories and critical incident narratives, surveys and latent variable modelling of key constructs to explain how contextual factors work to trigger mechanisms for specific outcomes relating to IMC's 300+ CHWs' performance. Participants will also include programme staff, CHWs and programme beneficiaries. Realist approaches will be used to better understand 'what works, for whom and under what conditions' for improving CHW performance within humanitarian contexts.--NEW SECTION--Trinity College Dublin's Health Policy and Management/Centre for Global Health Research Ethics Committee gave ethical approval for the protocol development phase. For the full research project, additional ethical approval will be sought from: Université St. Joseph (Lebanon), the Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health in Baghdad (Iraq) and the Middle East Technical University (Turkey).

Counterfeits and cheap whites as well as legal brands smuggled from countries not adopting track and trace technologies will require novel forensic tools to aid the disruption of their supply chains.--NEW SECTION--Data sets of trace element concentrations in tobacco were obtained using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry on samples of legal and illicit products mainly from Europe. Authentic and counterfeit products were discriminated by identifying outliers from data sets of legal products using Mahalanobis distance and graphical profiling methods. Identical and closely similar counterfeits were picked out using Euclidean distance, and counterfeit provenance was addressed using chemometric methods to identify geographical affinities.--NEW SECTION--Taking Marlboro as an exemplar, the major brands are shown to be remarkably consistent in composition, in marked contrast to counterfeits bearing the same brand name. Analysis of 35 illicit products seized in the European Union (EU) indicates that 18 are indistinguishable or closely similar to Marlboro legally sold in the EU, while 17 are sufficiently different to be deemed counterfeit, among them being 2 counterfeits so closely similar that their tobaccos are likely to come from the same source. The tobacco in the large majority of counterfeits in this data set appears to originate in Asia.--NEW SECTION--Multivariate and graphical analysis of trace elements in tobacco can effectively authenticate brands, crossmatch illicit products across jurisdictions and may identify their geographical sources.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The impact of nongenetic factors and how they influence the evolution of resistance is a largely unexplored area of research. Here we present a novel application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology for investigating how gene expression governs the adaptive pathways available to bacteria during the evolution of resistance. We examine the impact of gene expression changes on bacterial adaptation by constructing a library of deactivated CRISPR-Cas9 synthetic devices to tune the expression of a set of stress-response genes in Escherichia coli. We show that artificially inducing perturbations in gene expression imparts significant synthetic control over fitness and growth during stress exposure. We present evidence that these impacts are reversible; strains with synthetically perturbed gene expression regained wild-type growth phenotypes upon stress removal, while maintaining divergent growth characteristics under stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate a prevailing trend toward negative epistatic interactions when multiple gene perturbations are combined simultaneously, thereby posing an intrinsic constraint on gene expression underlying adaptive trajectories. Together, these results emphasize how CRISPR-Cas9 can be employed to engineer gene expression changes that shape bacterial adaptation, and present a novel approach to synthetically control the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.",eng,ACS synthetic biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

We therefore determined the association of a maternal high fat diet in pregnancy with offspring ovarian health during the gestation and postnatal female offspring in pig a model. Thirty-two Yorkshire gilts with similar bodyweights mated at the third estrus were randomly assigned to two nutrition levels of either a control (CON, crude fat: 7.27%) or a high fat diet (HFD, crude fat: 11.78%). Ovary samples were collected during the fetal (Day 55 (g55) and Day 90 of gestation (g90)) and offspring (prepuberty Day 160 (d160) and age at puberty) period to detect ovary development, antioxidant status and apoptosis cells. Maternal HFD did not influence notch signaling gene expression, which regulates primordial follicle formation and transformation, and ovarian histological effect at g55 and g90. However, maternal HFD reduced the numbers of large follicles at d160 and small follicle numbers upon puberty compared to CON in offspring. The results also revealed that the antioxidant index of total antioxidative capability (T-AOC), cytoplasmic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and mRNA expression were higher in the CON than the HFD at g90 and d160, whereas, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was decreased in the CON. Maternal HFD increased the inhibitor of the apoptosis-related gene of B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl2) mRNA expression at g90 and d160, whereas, pro-apoptotic-related gene bcl-2 assaciated X protein (bax) was reduced. These data show that the maternal high fat diet does not delay fetal ovarian development, but it changes ovarian health by the induction of oxidative stress and accelerating cell apoptosis in offspring.",eng,Nutrients,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The standard prophylactic treatment regimens for latent TB infection take 3-9 months, and new cases of TB require at least 6 months of treatment with multiple drugs. The management of latent TB infection and TB has become more challenging because of the spread of multidrug-resistant and extremely drug-resistant TB. Intensified efforts to find new TB drugs and immunotherapies are needed.

However, the development of a more effective vaccine is severely hampered by the lack of an immune correlate of protection. Candidate vaccines are currently evaluated using preclinical animal models, but experiments are long and costly and it is unclear whether the outcomes are predictive of efficacy in humans. Unlike measurements of single immunological parameters, mycobacterial growth inhibition assays (MGIAs) represent an unbiased functional approach which takes into account a range of immune mechanisms and their complex interactions. Such a controlled system offers the potential to evaluate vaccine efficacy and study mediators of protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb).

This prolonged therapy is likely due to the presence of M. tuberculosis persisters, which exhibit antibiotic tolerance. Inorganic polyphosphate [poly(P)] is a key regulatory molecule in the M. tuberculosis stringent response mediating antibiotic tolerance. The polyphosphate kinase PPK1 is responsible for poly(P) synthesis in M. tuberculosis, while the exopolyphosphatases PPX1 and PPX2 and the GTP synthase PPK2 are responsible for poly(P) hydrolysis. In the present study, we show by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry that poly(P)-accumulating M. tuberculosis mutant strains deficient in ppx1 or ppk2 had significantly lower intracellular levels of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and 1-deoxy-xylulose-5-phosphate. Real-time PCR revealed decreased expression of genes in the G3P synthesis pathway in each mutant. The ppx1-deficient mutant also showed a significant accumulation of metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as altered arginine and NADH metabolism. Each poly(P)-accumulating strain showed defective biofilm formation, while deficiency of ppk2 was associated with increased sensitivity to plumbagin and meropenem and deficiency of ppx1 led to enhanced susceptibility to clofazimine. A DNA vaccine expressing ppx1 and ppk2, together with two other members of the M. tuberculosis stringent response, M. tuberculosis rel and sigE, did not show protective activity against aerosol challenge with M. tuberculosis, but vaccine-induced immunity enhanced the killing activity of isoniazid in a murine model of chronic tuberculosis. In summary, poly(P)-regulating factors of the M. tuberculosis stringent response play an important role in M. tuberculosis metabolism, biofilm formation, and antibiotic sensitivity in vivo.",eng,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Currently available vaccines provide protection but often results in weaker/minimal mucosal immunity. Thus the present study is devoted to the development and in-vivo exploration of the colonically delivered biomimetic nanoparticles which capably enhance humoral as well as cellular immune response. In present work, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) entrapped nanoparticles containing Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) (HB+L-NP) were prepared by solvent evaporation method and characterized for particle size (~210nm), shape, zeta potential (-24mV±0.68), entrapment efficiency (58.45±1.68%), in-vitro release and antigen integrity. Dose escalation study was done to confirm prophylactic immune response following defined doses of prepared nanoparticulate formulations with or without MPLA. Intramuscular administered alum based marketed HBsAg (Genevac B) was used as standard (10μg) and were able to induce significant systemic (IgG) but remarkably low mucosal immune (IgA) response. Notably, HB+L-NP (0.5ml-10μg) induced strong systemic and robust mucosal immunity (510 and 470 mIU/ml respectively, p<0.001) from which mucosal was more significant due to the involvement of Common Mucosal Immune System (CMIS). Likewise, significant cellular immune response was elicited by HB+L-NP through T-cell activation (mixed Th1 and Th2) as confirmed by significantly increased cytokines level (IL-2 and Interferon-γ) in spleen homogenates.

In China, the incidence of CAD and the rate of mortality arising from it have increased every year. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by activated T cells, and it may be involved in the development of CAD. Genetic polymorphisms in functional regions of the IL17A gene have a plausible role in modulating the risk of CAD. To evaluate the role of IL17A polymorphisms as a risk factor for CAD, we performed a detailed analysis of possible functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in regulatory regions of IL17A. This study examined the potential association between CAD and five SNPs (rs8193037, rs8193036, rs3819024, rs2275913, and rs3748067) of the IL17A gene. The allelic or genotypic frequencies of the rs8193037 (promoter region) and rs8193036 (promoter region) polymorphisms in CAD were significantly different from those in healthy controls. The CAD subjects had a significantly lower frequency of the A allele of rs8193037 (P = 0.009, OR = 1.772, 95%CI = 1.146- 2.742) and the T allele of rs8193036 (P = 0.010, OR = 1.754, 95%CI = 1.139-2.701). Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed in one block (D' > 0.9). Significantly fewer T-G-G-A haplotypes (P = 0.045) were found in CAD subjects in block 1.

Ageing is associated with a number of changes in the brain that, collectively, contribute to the declines in cognitive function observed in older adults. Structurally, the ageing brain atrophies as white and grey matter volumes decrease. Oxidative stress and inflammation promote endothelial dysfunction thereby hampering cerebral perfusion and thus delivery of energy substrates and nutrients. Further, the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles contributes to neuronal loss. Of interest, there are substantial inter-individual differences in the degree to which these physical and functional changes impact upon cognitive function as we grow older. This review describes how engaging in physical activity and cognitive activities and adhering to a Mediterranean style diet promote 'brain health'. From a physiological perspective, we discuss the effects of these modifiable lifestyle behaviours on the brain, and how some recent human trials are beginning to show some promise as to the effectiveness of lifestyle behaviours in combating cognitive impairment.

Lack of investment in infrastructure required for producing and retaining adequate numbers of health professionals is one reason, and contextual factors related to socioeconomic development may further explain the trend. Therefore, this study sought to explore the relationships between country-level contextual factors and healthcare human resource production (defined as worker-to-population ratio) across 184 countries.--NEW SECTION--This exploratory observational study is grounded in complexity theory as a guiding framework. Variables were selected through a process that attempted to choose macro-level indicators identified by the interdisciplinary literature as known or likely to affect the number of healthcare workers in a country. The combination of these variables attempts to account for the gender- and class-sensitive identities of physicians and nurses. The analysis consisted of 1 year of publicly available data, using the most recently available year for each country where multiple regressions assessed how context may influence health worker production. Missing data were imputed using the ICE technique in STATA and the analyses rerun in R as an additional validity and rigor check.--NEW SECTION--The models explained 63 % of the nurse/midwife-to-population ratio (pseudo R (2) = 0.627, p = 0.0000) and 73 % of the physician-to-population ratio (pseudo R (2) = 0.729, p = 0.0000). Average years of school in a country's population, emigration rates, beds-per-1000 population, and low-income country statuses were consistently statistically significant predictors of production, with percentage of public and private sector financing of healthcare showing mixed effects.--NEW SECTION--Our study demonstrates that the strength of political, social, and economic institutions does impact human resources for health production and lays a foundation for studying how macro-level contextual factors influence physician and nurse workforce supply. In particular, the results suggest that public and private investments in the education sector would provide the greatest rate of return to countries.

To reveal the characteristics of fine particles in an industrial city of a developing country, two-year measurements of particle number size distribution (15.1 nm-661 nm), meteorological parameters, and trace gases were made in the city of Wuhan located in central China from June 2012 to May 2014. The annual average particle number concentrations in the nucleation mode (15.1 nm-30 nm), Aitken mode (30 nm-100 nm), and accumulation mode (100 nm-661 nm) reached 4923 cm(-3), 12193 cm(-3) and 4801 cm(-3), respectively. Based on Pearson coefficients between particle number concentrations and meteorological parameters, precipitation and temperature both had significantly negative relationships with particle number concentrations, whereas atmospheric pressure was positively correlated with the particle number concentrations. The diurnal variation of number concentration in nucleation mode particles correlated closely with photochemical processes in all four seasons. At the same time, distinct growth of particles from nucleation mode to Aitken mode was only found in spring, summer, and autumn. The two peaks of Aitken mode and accumulation mode particles in morning and evening corresponded obviously to traffic exhaust emissions peaks. A phenomenon of ""repeated, short-lived"" nucleation events have been created to explain the durability of high particle concentrations, which was instigated by exogenous pollutants, during winter in a case analysis of Wuhan. Measurements of hourly trace gases and segmental meteorological factors were applied as proxies for complex chemical reactions and dense industrial activities. The results of this study offer reasonable estimations of particle impacts and provide references for emissions control strategies in industrial cities of developing countries.",eng,International journal of environmental research and public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, little is known about the burden of itch outside the dermatology setting.--NEW SECTION--To determine the prevalence and impact of itch on quality of life (QOL) in the general internal medicine setting.--NEW SECTION--We performed a cross-sectional study of 2076 adults from an outpatient general internal medicine clinic, using an audio computer-assisted self-administered interview. A history of itch (acute or chronic) and other physical symptoms in the past week, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 10-item Global Health Questionnaire scores, and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 scores were assessed.--NEW SECTION--The prevalence of itch was 39.9 % and increased with age from 33.1 % at age 19-39 years to 45.9 % at age ≥80 years. In multivariable models controlled for socio-demographics, even feeling ""a little"" or ""some"" distress from itch was significantly associated with lower PROMIS global physical and mental health T-scores and estimated health utility scores (P ≤ 0.01). Further, feeling ""quite a lot"" of distress or ""very much"" distress from itch was associated with higher adjusted odds ratios for depressed mood (4.91 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3.36-7.18]) and anhedonia (4.46 [95 % CI 3.07-6.47]). The patient burden of itch was similar to those of pain, constipation, sexual dysfunction, cough, and weight loss.--NEW SECTION--Itch occurs commonly in the primary care setting and is associated with poor QOL. Physicians should inquire about itch and its associations during review of systems. Future studies are needed to distinguish between the effects of acute and chronic itch.",eng,American journal of clinical dermatology,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016

The purpose of this study was to describe the maternal and neonatal characteristics of gastroschisis in Uganda, estimate the mortality and elucidate opportunities for intervention.--NEW SECTION--An ethics-approved, prospective cohort study was conducted over a one-year period. All babies presenting with gastroschisis in Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda were enrolled and followed up to 30days. Univariate and descriptive statistical analyses were performed on demographic, maternal, perinatal, and clinical outcome data.--NEW SECTION--42 babies with gastroschisis presented during the study period. Mortality was 98% (n=41). Maternal characteristics demonstrate a mean maternal age of 21.8 (±3.9) years, 40% (n=15) were primiparous, and fewer than 10% (n=4) of mothers reported a history of alcohol use, and all denied cigarette smoking and NSAID use. Despite 93% (n=39) of mothers receiving prenatal care and 24% (n=10) a prenatal ultrasound, correct prenatal diagnosis was 2% (n=1). Perinatal data show that 81% of deliveries occurred in a health facility. The majority of babies (58%) arrived at Mulago Hospital within 12h of birth, however 52% were breastfeeding, 53% did not have intravenous access and only 19% had adequate bowel protection in place. Four patients (9%) arrived with gangrenous bowel. One patient, the only survivor, had primary closure. Average time to death was 4.8days [range<1 to 14days].--NEW SECTION--The mortality of gastroschisis in Uganda is alarmingly high.

In a previous study, we found that healing prayer was effective in reducing depressive symptoms. Subjects suffering with depression according to HAM-D scores underwent task-based brain functional MRI (fMRI) prior to and after a 6-week prayer intervention, and depression symptoms were assessed at both time points and at a 12-month follow-up. Average HAM-D scores decreased from 21.6±3.0 prior to the intervention to 4.0±2.7 immediately afterwards (14 subjects) and remained low (3.7±3.4) at 12-month follow-up (11 subjects). fMRI demonstrated increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex during focus on the traumatic memory after the prayer intervention. Changes in activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus correlated with improvement in depressive symptoms. Activity in the precuneus region decreased after the prayer intervention when subjects focused on the negative feelings associated with the trauma. We conclude that increased activity in the prefrontal cortex after healing prayer may be associated with increased cognitive control over emotions. Healing prayer may help to dissociate the memory of the trauma from feelings associated with it, as evidenced by changes in the precuneus region.",eng,Complementary therapies in medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Findings from a systematic review and metaregression analysis.","While the efficacy and effectiveness of brief interventions for alcohol (ABI) have been demonstrated in primary care, there is weaker evidence in other settings and reviews do not consider differences in content. We conducted a systematic review to measure the effect of ABIs on alcohol consumption and how it differs by the setting, practitioner group and content of intervention.--NEW SECTION--We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO; CINAHL, Social Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library and Global Health up to January 2015 for randomised controlled trials that measured effectiveness of ABIs on alcohol consumption. We grouped outcomes into measures of quantity and frequency indices. We used multilevel meta-analysis to estimate pooled effect sizes and tested for the effect of moderators through a multiparameter Wald test. Stratified analysis of a subset of quantity and frequency outcomes was conducted as a sensitivity check.--NEW SECTION--52 trials were included contributing data on 29 891 individuals. ABIs reduced the quantity of alcohol consumed by 0.15 SDs. While neither the setting nor content appeared to significantly moderate intervention effectiveness, the provider did in some analyses. Interventions delivered by nurses had the most effect in reducing quantity (d=-0.23, 95% CI (-0.33 to -0.13)) but not frequency of alcohol consumption. All content groups had statistically significant mean effects, brief advice was the most effective in reducing quantity consumed (d=-0.20, 95% CI (-0.30 to -0.09)). Effects were maintained in the stratified sensitivity analysis at the first and last assessment time.--NEW SECTION--ABIs play a small but significant role in reducing alcohol consumption. Findings show the positive role of nurses in delivering interventions.

The first and second line drug susceptibility testing was carried out using the 1% proportion method on the Lφwenstein-Jensen medium. Full demographic, environmental and clinical history was evaluated.--NEW SECTION--Prevalence of resistance to any TB drug was 13.8%. Eight (4.4%) patients had MDR-TB (2.4% in the province of East Azerbaijan and 9.3% in the province of Ardabil) and one patient had extensively drug-resistant TB. Patient resistance to both isoniazid and streptomycin was the most prevalent at a rate of 8.3%. Patients showed the least resistance to ethambutol (2.8%). There was a significant relationship between the previous history of TB drug treatment and TB drug resistance. Migrants from rural to urban areas were in high-risk groups for the occurrence of TB drug resistance.--NEW SECTION--In our study, prevalence of MDR was less than the global average.

The rapid spread of mobile technology creates an opportunity to use innovative methods to reduce the burden of STIs. This systematic review identified recent randomised controlled trials that employed mobile technology to improve sexual health outcomes.--NEW SECTION--The following databases were searched for randomised controlled trials of mobile technology based sexual health interventions with any outcome measures and all patient populations: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Methodology Register, NHS Health Technology Assessment Database, and Web of Science (science and social science citation index) (Jan 1999-July 2014). Interventions designed to increase adherence to HIV medication were not included. Two authors independently extracted data on the following elements: interventions, allocation concealment, allocation sequence, blinding, completeness of follow-up, and measures of effect. Trials were assessed for methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated effect estimates using intention to treat analysis.--NEW SECTION--A total of ten randomised trials were identified with nine separate study groups. No trials had a low risk of bias. The trials targeted: 1) promotion of uptake of sexual health services, 2) reduction of risky sexual behaviours and 3) reduction of recall bias in reporting sexual activity. Interventions employed up to five behaviour change techniques. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity in trial assessment and reporting. Two trials reported statistically significant improvements in the uptake of sexual health services using SMS reminders compared to controls. One trial increased knowledge. One trial reported promising results in increasing condom use but no trial reported statistically significant increases in condom use. Finally, one trial showed that collection of sexual health information using mobile technology was acceptable.--NEW SECTION--The findings suggest interventions delivered by SMS interventions can increase uptake of sexual health services and STI testing. High quality trials of interventions using standardised objective measures and employing a wider range of behavioural change techniques are needed to assess if interventions delivered by mobile phone can alter safer sex behaviours carried out between couples and reduce STIs.",eng,BMC public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Given the large number of deliveries that are managed by unskilled or traditional birth attendants outside of health facilities, and the fact that there is on-going discussion regarding the role of traditional birth attendants in the maternal newborn health (MNH) service continuum, we sought to ascertain the practices of traditional birth attendants in our catchment area. The findings of this descriptive study might help inform conversations regarding the roles that traditional birth attendants can play in maternal-newborn health care.--NEW SECTION--A structured questionnaire was used in a survey that included one hundred unskilled birth attendants in western Kenya. Descriptive statistics were employed.--NEW SECTION--Inappropriate or outdated practices were reported in relation to some obstetric complications and newborn care. Encouraging results were reported with regard to positive relationships that traditional birth attendants have with their local health facilities. Furthermore, high rates of referral to health facilities was reported for many common obstetric emergencies and similar rates for reporting of pregnancy outcomes to village elders and chiefs.--NEW SECTION--Potentially harmful or outdated practices with regard to maternal and newborn care among traditional birth attendants in western Kenya were revealed by this study. There were high rates of traditional birth attendant referrals of pregnant mothers with obstetric complications to health facilities.

A mobile clinic provides a wide range of services but in most countries the main focus is on health services for women and children. It is anticipated that improvement of the accessibility of health services via mobile clinics will improve women's and children's health.--NEW SECTION--To evaluate the impact of mobile clinic services on women's and children's health.--NEW SECTION--For related systematic reviews, we searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), CRD; Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA), CRD; NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), CRD (searched 20 February 2014).For primary studies, we searched ISI Web of Science, for studies that have cited the included studies in this review (searched 18 January 2016); WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 23 May 2016); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of The Cochrane Library. www.cochranelibrary.com (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register) (searched 7 April 2015); MEDLINE, OvidSP (searched 7 April 2015); Embase, OvidSP (searched 7 April 2015); CINAHL, EbscoHost (searched 7 April 2015); Global Health, OvidSP (searched 8 April 2015); POPLINE, K4Health (searched 8 April 2015); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, ISI Web of Science (searched 8 April 2015); Global Health Library, WHO (searched 8 April 2015); PAHO, VHL (searched 8 April 2015); WHOLIS, WHO (searched 8 April 2015); LILACS, VHL (searched 9 April 2015).--NEW SECTION--We included individual- and cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. We included controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies provided they had at least two intervention sites and two control sites. Also, we included interrupted time series (ITS) studies if there was a clearly defined point in time when the intervention occurred and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. We defined the intervention of a mobile clinic as a clinic vehicle with a healthcare provider (with or without a nurse) and a driver that visited areas on a regular basis. The participants were women (18 years or older) and children (under the age of 18 years) in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.--NEW SECTION--Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy, extracted data from the included studies using a specially-designed data extraction form based on the Cochrane EPOC Group data collection checklist, and assessed full-text articles for eligibility. All authors performed analyses, 'Risk of bias' assessments, and assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.--NEW SECTION--Two cluster-RCTs met the inclusion criteria of this review. Both studies were conducted in the USA.One study tested whether offering onsite mobile mammography combined with health education was more effective at increasing breast cancer screening rates than offering health education only, including reminders to attend a static clinic for mammography. Women in the group offered mobile mammography and health education may be more likely to undergo mammography within three months of the intervention than those in the comparison group (55% versus 40%; odds ratio (OR) 1.83, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.74; low certainty evidence).A cost-effectiveness analysis of mammography at mobile versus static units found that the total cost per patient screened may be higher for mobile units than for static units. The incremental costs per patient screened for a mobile over a stationary unit were USD 61 and USD 45 for a mobile full digital unit and a mobile film unit respectively.The second study compared asthma outcomes for children aged two to six years who received asthma care from a mobile asthma clinic and children who received standard asthma care from the usual (static) primary provider. Children who receive asthma care from a mobile asthma clinic may experience little or no difference in symptom-free days, urgent care use and caregiver-reported medication use compared to children who receive care from their usual primary care provider. All of the evidence was of low certainty.--NEW SECTION--The paucity of evidence and the restricted range of contexts from which evidence is available make it difficult to draw conclusions on the impacts of mobile clinics on women's and children's health compared to static clinics.

Such government guidance, referred to as public stewardship, encompasses government policies, regulatory mechanisms, and implementation strategies for ensuring accountability in the delivery of services. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not been the subject of a systematic review.--NEW SECTION--To assess the effects of public sector regulation, training, or co-ordination of the private for-profit health sector in low- and middle-income countries.--NEW SECTION--For related systematic reviews, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) 2015, Issue 4; Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) 2015, Issue 1; Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) 2015, Issue 1; all part of The Cochrane Library, and searched 28 April 2015.

In addition, in April 2016, we searched the reference lists of relevant articles, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and various electronic databases of grey literature.--NEW SECTION--Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, interrupted time series studies, or controlled before-after studies.--NEW SECTION--Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data, comparing their results and resolving discrepancies by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), where appropriate, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). We did not conduct meta-analysis because of heterogeneity of interventions and study designs.--NEW SECTION--We identified 20,177 records, 50 of them potentially eligible. We excluded 39 potentially eligible studies because they did not involve a rigorous evaluation of training, regulation, or co-ordination of private for-profit healthcare providers in LMICs; five studies identified after the review was submitted are awaiting assessment; and six studies met our inclusion criteria. Two included studies assessed training alone; one assessed regulation alone; three assessed a multifaceted intervention involving training and regulation; and none assessed co-ordination. All six included studies targeted private for-profit pharmacy workers in Africa and Asia.Three studies found that training probably increases sale of oral rehydration solution (one trial in Kenya, 106 pharmacies: RR 3.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 6.75; and one trial in Indonesia, 87 pharmacies: RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.93) and dispensing of anti-malarial drugs (one trial in Kenya, 293 pharmacies: RR 8.76, 95% CI 0.94 to 81.81); moderate-certainty evidence.One study conducted in the Lao People's Democratic Republic shows that regulation of the distribution and sale of registered pharmaceutical products may improve composite pharmacy indicators (one trial, 115 pharmacies: improvements in four of six pharmacy indicators; low-certainty evidence).The outcome in three multifaceted intervention studies was the quality of pharmacy practice; including the ability to ask questions, give advice, and provide appropriate treatment. The trials applied regulation, training, and peer influence in sequence; and the study design does not permit separation of the effects of the different interventions. Two trials conducted among 136 pharmacies in Vietnam found that the multifaceted intervention may improve the quality of pharmacy practice; but the third study, involving 146 pharmacies in Vietnam and Thailand, found that the intervention may have little or no effects on the quality of pharmacy practice (low-certainty evidence).Only two studies (both conducted in Vietnam) reported cost data, with no rigorous assessment of the economic implications of implementing the interventions in resource-constrained settings. No study reported data on equity, mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, satisfaction, or attitudes.--NEW SECTION--Training probably improves quality of care (i.e. adherence to recommended practice), regulation may improve quality of care, and we are uncertain about the effects of co-ordination on quality of private for-profit healthcare services in LMICs. The likelihood that further research will find the effect of training to be substantially different from the results of this review is moderate; implying that monitoring of the impact is likely to be needed if training is implemented. The low certainty of the evidence for regulation implies that the likelihood of further research finding the effect of regulation to be substantially different from the results of this review is high. Therefore, an impact evaluation is warranted if government regulation of private for-profit providers is implemented in LMICs. Rigorous evaluations of these interventions should also assess other outcomes such as impacts on equity, cost implications, mortality, morbidity, and adverse effects.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In 2008, SHCH partnered with AmeriCares, a global health organisation to set up and deliver a breast cancer programme to provide education, diagnosis and treatment for women with breast cancer. The objective of this study is to characterise the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of women treated under this program.--NEW SECTION--A total of 215 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer from 1 March 2008 until 31 March 2011 were studied. Age at diagnosis, tumour size, histological type, tumour grade, ER, lymph node involvement, treatment modalities (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy) were recorded. Data on mortality at 3 years were obtained whenever possible.--NEW SECTION--The median age was 47 years old. Some 77.8% were diagnosed with stage 3 and 4 lesions, and 78.5% underwent mastectomy, of which 28.4% the intent was palliative. Of those whose ER status were known, only 48.3% were ER positive. Only 6 patients could afford chemotherapy while only 1 patient had radiotherapy. Hormone therapy was provided free for those who were ER positive. The overall survival rate at 3 years was 39.1%.--NEW SECTION--Breast cancer presents at a late stage, and because treatment is suboptimal, survival is poor in Cambodia.

This study assessed QOL before and after chemo radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients.--NEW SECTION--This followup study covered sixtyseven newly diagnosed women with advanced cervical cancer (stages 2b to 4b). Structured questionnaires (the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, EORTC QLQC30 and EORTC QLQCX24) were used to assess the change in QOL after 6 months of treatment.--NEW SECTION--The mean age of women at the time of detection of cervical cancer was 52.3±11.29 years (Range 3075 years). Six months survival was 92.53%. The mean global health score of cervical cancer patients after six months of treatment was 59.52, which was significantly higher than the pretreatment score of 50.15 (p=0.00007). Physical, cognitive and emotional functioning improved significantly (p<0.05) after treatment. Fatigue, pain, insomnia and appetite loss improved but episodes of diarrhea increased after treatment. The mean ""symptoms score"" using EORTC QLQCX24 post treatment was 20.0 which was significantly lower as compared to the pre treatment score 30.0 (p<0.00001). Sexual enjoyment and sexual functioning decreased significantly after treatment.--NEW SECTION--QOL of newly diagnosed cervical cancer patients improved significantly following chemoradio therapy.

Probiotics may be essential to people with depression, which remains a global health challenge, as depression is a metabolic brain disorder. However, the efficacy of probiotics for depression is controversial. This study aimed to systematically review the existing evidence on the effect of probiotics-based interventions on depression. Randomized, controlled trials, identified through screening multiple databases and grey literature, were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software using a fixed-effects model. The meta-analysis showed that probiotics significantly decreased the depression scale score (MD (depressive disorder) = -0.30, 95% CI (-0.51--0.09), p = 0.005) in the subjects. Probiotics had an effect on both the healthy population (MD = -0.25, 95% CI (-0.47--0.03), p = 0.03) and patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (MD = -0.73, 95% CI (-1.37--0.09), p = 0.03). Probiotics had an effect on the population aged under 60 (MD = -0.43, 95% CI (-0.72--0.13), p = 0.005), while it had no effect on people aged over 65 (MD = -0.18, 95% CI (-0.47-0.11), p = 0.22).

27507822,10.1128/mBio.00227-16,Population Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Praziquantel in Ugandan Children with Intestinal Schistosomiasis: Higher Dosages Are Required for Maximal Efficacy.,"Each year, millions of African children receive praziquantel (PZQ) by mass drug administration (MDA) to treat schistosomiasis at a standard single dose of 40 mg/kg of body weight, a direct extrapolation from studies of adults. A higher dose of 60 mg/kg is also acceptable for refractory cases. We conducted the first PZQ pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study in young children comparing dosing. Sixty Ugandan children aged 3 to 8 years old with egg patent Schistosoma mansoni received PZQ at either 40 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg. PK parameters of PZQ racemate and enantiomers (R and S) were quantified. PD outcomes were assessed by standard fecal egg counts and novel schistosome-specific serum (circulating anodic antigen [CAA]) and urine (circulating cathodic antigen [CCA]) antigen assays. Population PK and PD analyses were performed to estimate drug exposure in individual children, and the relationship between drug exposure and parasitological cure was estimated using logistic regression. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to identify better, future dosing regimens. There was marked PK variability between children, but the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of PZQ was strongly predictive of the parasitological cure rate (CR). Although no child achieved antigenic cure, which is suggestive of an important residual adult worm burden, higher AUC was associated with greater CAA antigenic decline at 24 days. To optimize the performance of PZQ, analysis of our simulations suggest that higher doses (>60 mg/kg) are needed, particularly in smaller children.--NEW SECTION--Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease, typically associated with chronic morbidity, and its control is a global health priority. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the only available antiparasitic drug and is often given out, as a single oral dose (40 mg/kg), to school-aged children by mass drug administration (MDA) schemes operating within preventive chemotherapy campaigns as endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This current strategy has several limitations. (i) It excludes preschool children who can be patently infected. (ii) It delivers PZQ at a dose directly extrapolated from adult pharmacological studies. To address these problems, we conducted the first pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of young children within an area of Uganda where Schistosoma mansoni is hyperendemic. Our results demonstrate that a higher dose (>60 mg/kg) is required, especially in smaller children, and draw attention to the need for further optimization of PZQ treatment based on schistosome antigenic assays, which are more sensitive to pharmacodynamic markers.",eng,mBio,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27507678,10.1111/jocn.13343,Bridging the gap between guidelines and practice in the management of emerging infectious diseases: a qualitative study of emergency nurses.,"To explore the difficulties and strategies regarding guideline implementation among emergency nurses.--NEW SECTION--Emerging infectious diseases remain an underlying source of global health concern. Guidelines for accident and emergency departments would require adjustments for infectious disease management. However, disparities between guidelines and nurses' practice are frequently reported, which undermines the implementation of these guidelines into practice. This article explores the experience of frontline emergency nurses regarding guideline implementation and provides an in-depth account of their strategies in bridging guideline-practice gaps.--NEW SECTION--A qualitative descriptive design was used.--NEW SECTION--Semi-structured, face-to-face, individual interviews were conducted between November 2013-May 2014. A purposive sample of 12 frontline emergency nurses from five accident and emergency departments in Hong Kong were recruited. The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed with a qualitative content analysis approach.--NEW SECTION--Four key categories associated with guideline-practice gaps emerged, including getting work done, adapting to accelerated infection control measures, compromising care standards and resolving competing clinical judgments across collaborating departments. The results illustrate that the guideline-practice gaps could be associated with inadequate provision of corresponding organisational supports after guidelines are established.--NEW SECTION--The nurses' experiences have uncovered the difficulties in the implementation of guidelines in emergency care settings and the corresponding strategies used to address these problems. The nurses' experiences reflect their endeavour in adjusting accordingly and adapting themselves to their circumstances in the face of unfeasible guidelines.--NEW SECTION--It is important to customise guidelines to the needs of frontline nurses. Maintaining cross-departmental consensus on guideline interpretation and operation is also indicated as an important component for effective guideline implementation.",eng,Journal of clinical nursing,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

To metastasize, carcinoma cells must reactivate a latent program called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), through which epithelial cancer cells acquire mesenchymal-like traits.Glypican-3 (GPC3), a proteoglycan involved in the regulation of proliferation and survival, has been associated with cancer. In this study we observed that the expression of GPC3 is opposite to the invasive/metastatic ability of Hs578T, MDA-MB231, ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines. GPC3 silencing activated growth, cell death resistance, migration, and invasive/metastatic capacity of MCF-7 cancer cells, while GPC3 overexpression inhibited these properties in MDA-MB231 tumor cell line. Moreover, silencing of GPC3 deepened the MCF-7 breast cancer cells mesenchymal characteristics, decreasing the expression of the epithelial marker E-Cadherin. On the other side, GPC3 overexpression induced the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells, which re-expressed E-Cadherin and reduced the expression of vimentin and N-Cadherin. While GPC3 inhibited the canonical Wnt/β-Catenin pathway in the breast cancer cells, this inhibition did not have effect on E-Cadherin expression. We demonstrated that the transcriptional repressor of E-Cadherin - ZEB1 - is upregulated in GPC3 silenced MCF-7 cells, while it is downregulated when GPC3 was overexpressed in MDA-MB231 cells. We presented experimental evidences showing that GPC3 induces the E-Cadherin re-expression in MDA-MB231 cells through the downregulation of ZEB1.Our data indicate that GPC3 is an important regulator of EMT in breast cancer, and a potential target for procedures against breast cancer metastasis.",eng,Oncotarget,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In addition to reduced risk factors for chronic conditions, a strong health system for managing chronic conditions is vital. This study assessed the extent to which populations in six Latin American and Caribbean countries receive high-quality primary care, and it examined the relationship between experiences with care and perceptions of health system performance. We applied a validated survey on access, use, and satisfaction with health care services to nationally representative samples of the populations of Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Mexico, and Panama. Respondents reported considerable gaps in the ways in which primary care is organized, financed, and delivered. Nearly half reported using the emergency department for a condition they considered treatable in a primary care setting. Reports of more primary care problems were associated with worse perceptions of health system performance and quality and less receipt of preventive care.

The emerging epidemic of multi- and extensively drug-resistant (M/XDR) TB further imperils health workers, patients and public health. Health facilities with inadequate infection control are risky environments for the emergence and transmission of TB. There was no study that presented data on infection control practices of health care workers. This study aimed to assess tuberculosis infection control practices and associated factors among health care workers in West Gojjam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia.--NEW SECTION--Institution based quantitative cross-sectional study triangulated with qualitative observation and key informant interview was conducted. Six hundred sixty two health care workers were selected by multistage random sampling method. Self-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data. Observation checklists and key informant interview guides were used to collect qualitative data. Quantitative data were entered in to Epi Info version 3.5.3 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval was used to identify factors associated with TB infection control practice of health care workers. Qualitative data were translated, transcribed, analyzed and triangulated with the quantitative findings.--NEW SECTION--The proportion of proper TB infection control (TBIC) practices was 38 %. Qualitative data showed that administrative, environmental and personal respiratory protection control measures were not practiced well.

We examined global disparities of hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control in 2010 and compared secular changes from 2000 to 2010.--NEW SECTION--We searched MEDLINE from 1995 through 2014 and supplemented with manual searches of retrieved article references. We included 135 population-based studies of 968 419 adults from 90 countries. Sex- and age-specific hypertension prevalences from each country were applied to population data to calculate regional and global numbers of hypertensive adults. Proportions of awareness, treatment, and control from each country were applied to hypertensive populations to obtain regional and global estimates.--NEW SECTION--In 2010, 31.1% (95% confidence interval, 30.0%-32.2%) of the world's adults had hypertension; 28.5% (27.3%-29.7%) in high-income countries and 31.5% (30.2%-32.9%) in low- and middle-income countries. An estimated 1.39 (1.34-1.44) billion people had hypertension in 2010: 349 (337-361) million in high-income countries and 1.04 (0.99-1.09) billion in low- and middle-income countries. From 2000 to 2010, the age-standardized prevalence of hypertension decreased by 2.6% in high-income countries, but increased by 7.7% in low- and middle-income countries. During the same period, the proportions of awareness (58.2% versus 67.0%), treatment (44.5% versus 55.6%), and control (17.9% versus 28.4%) increased substantially in high-income countries, whereas awareness (32.3% versus 37.9%) and treatment (24.9% versus 29.0%) increased less, and control (8.4% versus 7.7%) even slightly decreased in low- and middle-income countries.--NEW SECTION--Global hypertension disparities are large and increasing.

The prevalence of HL is reportedly higher in developing countries such as the Sub-Saharan African island of São Tomé and Príncipe, where the deaf community is estimated to be less than 1% of the population. We investigated the role of the DFNB1 locus (GJB2 and GJB6 genes) in the etiology of nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSSHL) in São Tomé and Príncipe. A sample of 316 individuals, comprising 136 NSSHL patients (92 bilateral, 44 unilateral) and 180 controls, underwent a clinical and audiological examination. Sequencing of the GJB2 coding region and testing for the (GJB6-D13S1830) and del(GJB6-D13S1854) GJB6 deletions were performed. A total of 311 out of 316 individuals were successfully analyzed regarding the GJB2 and GJB6 genetic variations, respectively. The frequency of the GJB2 coding mutations in patients and controls was low. Some of those coding mutations are the most commonly found in Eurasian and Mediterranean populations and have also been identified in Portugal. None of the GJB6 deletions was present. The presence of certain coding variants in São Tomé and Príncipe suggests a non-Sub-Saharan genetic influx and supports the previously reported genetic influx from European (mainly Portuguese) ancestors. In summary, DFNB1 locus does not appear to be a major contributor to NSSHL in São Tomé and Príncipe. However, the presence of both pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations in GJB2 suggests that GJB2-related NSSHL might still occur in this population, warranting further research on GJB2 testing in NSSHL cases.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The few available drugs have limitations including low efficacy against Trichuris trichiura infections. As a starting point toward drug repositioning, we studied a set of FDA-approved oncology drugs for activity against Trichuris muris since targets relevant to cancer therapy might have a function in helminth biology. Drugs were tested in vitro on the larval and adult stage of T. muris. Compounds active in vitro were tested in the T. muris mouse model at single oral dosages of 200-400 mg/kg. Of the 114 drugs tested in vitro, 12 showed activity against T. muris larvae (>80 % drug effect at 50 μM). Ten of these drugs were also active on the adult worm stage (>80 % drug effect at 50 μM), of which six revealed IC50 values between 1.8 and 5.0 μM.

The argument of this paper is that such thinking is a case of 'the right thing at the wrong time': it seriously underestimates the scale of the work against HIV and AIDS, and the speed with which we need to undertake it, if we are to consolidate the gains we have made to date, let alone reduce it to manageable proportions. The looming 'fiscal crunch' makes the challenges all the more daunting; even in the best circumstances, the time required to establish UHCs capable of providing both essential health services and a very rapid scale-up of the fight against HIV and AIDS is insufficient when set against the urgency of ensuring that AIDS does not eventuate as a global health catastrophe.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2018

Accordingly, it is strongly suggested that smoking cessation be incorporated in TB control programs. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of two smoking cessation methods among newly-diagnosed pulmonary TB patients.--NEW SECTION--A total of 210 newly-diagnosed pulmonary TB patients from Tehran, Iran with smoking habits were included in this randomized clinical trial during 2012-2013. Patients were assigned to three groups of control (just TB medical treatment), brief advice (TB medical treatment plus individualized counseling sessions of quitting behavioral therapy) and combined intervention (TB medical treatment plus individualized counseling sessions of quitting behavioral therapy plus medical treatment with slow release bupropion).

Although the World Health Organisation (WHO) strongly recommends the inclusion of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in national immunisation programmes (NIP's) worldwide, this has not occurred in many countries in the WHO South East Asia and Western Pacific regions - particularly longstanding middle-income countries. It is widely accepted that carriage of S. pneumoniae is a precursor to developing any pneumococcal disease. The reduction in pneumococcal disease from vaccine serotypes (VT) following widespread implementation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is believed to be through the direct immunogenic protective effect of immunised individuals as well as indirectly through herd immunity diminishing the incidence of disease in nonimmunised individuals. In Malaysia, pneumococcal disease is not included in national surveillance programmes and although PCVs have been licensed, they have not been included in the NIP. Hence, the vaccine is only available privately and the majority of the population is not able to afford it.

However, the therapeutic value of a number of antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, against intracellular pathogenic bacteria is compromised due to their inability to traverse eukaryotic membranes. For this significant problem to be addressed, a cleavable conjugate of the antibiotic kanamycin and a nonmembrane lytic, broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide with efficient mammalian cell penetration, P14LRR, was prepared. This approach allows kanamycin to enter mammalian cells as a conjugate linked via a tether that breaks down in the reducing environment within cells. Potent antimicrobial activity of the P14KanS conjugate was demonstrated in vitro, and this reducible conjugate effectively cleared intracellular pathogenic bacteria within macrophages more potently than that of a conjugate lacking the disulfide moiety. Notably, successful clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within macrophages was observed with the dual antibiotic conjugate, and Salmonella levels were significantly reduced in an in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans model.",eng,Journal of the American Chemical Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27492749,10.1017/S1049023X16000650,Innovation in Graduate Education for Health Professionals in Humanitarian Emergencies.,"The objective of this report was to show how the Center for Humanitarian Emergencies (the Center) at Emory University (Atlanta, Georgia USA) has trained graduate students to respond to complex humanitarian emergencies (CHEs) through innovative educational programs, with the goal of increasing the number of trained humanitarian workers. Natural disasters are on the rise with more than twice as many occurring from 2000-2009 as there were from 1980-1989. In 2012 alone, 144 million people were affected by a natural disaster or displaced by conflict worldwide. This has created an immense need for trained humanitarian workers to respond effectively to such disasters. The Center has developed a model for educational programming that targets learners along an educational continuum ranging from the undergraduate level through continuing professional education. These programs, based in the Rollins School of Public Health (RSPH) of Emory University, include: a competency-based graduate certificate program (the Certificate) in humanitarian emergencies; a fellowship program for mid-career professionals; and funded field practica. The competency-based Certificate program began in 2010 with a cohort of 14 students. Since then, 101 students have received the Certificate with 50 more due for completion in 2016 and 2017 combined. The fellowship program for mid-career professionals has hosted four fellows from conflict-affected or resource-poor countries, who have then gone on to assume leadership positions with humanitarian organizations. From 2009-2015, the field practicum program supported 34 students in international summer practicum experiences related to emergency response or preparedness. Students have participated in summer field experiences on every continent but Australia. Together the Certificate, funded field practicum opportunities, and the fellowship comprise current efforts in providing innovative education and training for graduate and post-graduate students of public health in humanitarian response. These modest efforts are just the beginning in terms of addressing the global shortage of skilled public health professionals that can coordinate humanitarian response.

27492477,10.1126/science.aah6157,Protective efficacy of multiple vaccine platforms against Zika virus challenge in rhesus monkeys.,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is responsible for a major ongoing epidemic in the Americas and has been causally associated with fetal microcephaly. The development of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine is therefore an urgent global health priority. Here we demonstrate that three different vaccine platforms protect against ZIKV challenge in rhesus monkeys. A purified inactivated virus vaccine induced ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies and completely protected monkeys against ZIKV strains from both Brazil and Puerto Rico. Purified immunoglobulin from vaccinated monkeys also conferred passive protection in adoptive transfer studies. A plasmid DNA vaccine and a single-shot recombinant rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 vector vaccine, both expressing ZIKV premembrane and envelope, also elicited neutralizing antibodies and completely protected monkeys against ZIKV challenge. These data support the rapid clinical development of ZIKV vaccines for humans.",eng,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27491850,10.1007/s00894-016-3064-3,In-silico studies on DegP protein of Plasmodium falciparum in search of anti-malarials.,"Despite encouraging progress over the past decade, malaria caused by the Plasmodium parasite continues to pose an enormous disease burden and is one of the major global health problems. The extreme challenge in malaria management is the resistance of parasites to traditional monochemotherapies like chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. No vaccine is yet in sight, and the foregoing effective drugs are also losing ground against the disease due to the resistivity of parasites. New antimalarials with novel mechanisms of action are needed to circumvent existing or emerging drug resistance. DegP protein, secretory in nature has been shown to be involved in regulation of thermo-oxidative stress generated during asexual life cycle of Plasmodium, probably required for survival of parasite in host. Considering the significance of protein, in this study, we have generated a three-dimensional structure of PfDegP followed by validation of the modeled structure using several tools like RAMPAGE, ERRAT, and others. We also performed an in-silico screening of small molecule database against PfDegP using Glide. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation of protein and protein-ligand complex was carried out using GROMACS. This study substantiated potential drug-like molecules and provides the scope for development of novel antimalarial drugs.",eng,Journal of molecular modeling,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Science in this region has even been compared to a night sky with just a few specks of light. To make those lights as reachable as possible, we developed the Latin America and the Caribbean Search Strategy (LACSS). This is a new method to utilize our region's health promotion results within MEDLINE/PubMed. In contrast to a typical MeSH query, LACSS retrieves up to six times more publication results regarding non-communicable diseases, neglected tropical diseases, injuries and other important public health relevant topics in the region. We believe that global health promotion will be improved in this region by improving its visibility, and this search strategy will contribute to this.",eng,Global health promotion,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2018

27489749,10.7759/cureus.656,Implementing an Innovative Prehospital Care Provider Training Course in Nine Cambodian Provinces.,"Despite significant improvements in health outcomes nationally, many Cambodians continue to experience morbidity and mortality due to inadequate access to quality emergency medical services. Over recent decades, the Cambodian healthcare system and civil infrastructure have advanced markedly and now possess many of the components required to establish a well functioning emergency medical system. These components include enhanced access to emergency transportation through large scale road development efforts, widspread availability of emergency communication channels via the spread of cellphone and internet technology, and increased access to health services for poor patients through the implementation of health financing schemes. However, the system still lacks a number of key elements, one of which is trained prehospital care providers. Working in partnership with local providers, our team created an innovative, Cambodia-specific prehospital care provider training course to help fill this gap. Participants received training on prehospital care skills and knowledge most applicable to the Cambodian healthcare system, which was divided into four modules: Basic Prehospital Care Skills and Adult Medical Emergencies, Traumatic Emergencies, Obstetric Emergencies, and Neonatal/Pediatric Emergencies. The course was implemented in nine of Cambodia's most populous provinces, concurrent with a number of overarching emergency medical service system improvement efforts. Overall, the course was administered to 1,083 Cambodian providers during a 27-month period, with 947 attending the entire course and passing the course completion exam.",eng,Cureus,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27489267,10.1128/JVI.01051-16,Acute Liver Damage Associated with Innate Immune Activation in a Small Nonhuman Primate Model of Hepacivirus Infection.,"Despite its importance in shaping adaptive immune responses, viral clearance, and immune-based inflammation, tissue-specific innate immunity remains poorly characterized for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection due to the lack of access to acutely infected tissues. In this study, we evaluated the impact of natural killer (NK) cells and myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells on control of virus replication and virus-induced pathology caused by another, more rapidly resolving hepacivirus, GB virus B (GBV-B), in infections of common marmosets. High plasma and liver viral loads and robust hepatitis characterized acute GBV-B infection, and while viremia was generally cleared by 2 to 3 months postinfection, hepatitis and liver fibrosis persisted after clearance. Coinciding with peak viral loads and liver pathology, the levels of NK cells, mDCs, and pDCs in the liver increased up to 3-fold. Although no obvious numerical changes in peripheral innate cells occurred, circulating NK cells exhibited increased perforin and Ki67 expression levels and increased surface expression of CXCR3. These data suggested that increased NK cell arming and proliferation as well as tissue trafficking may be associated with influx into the liver during acute infection. Indeed, NK cell frequencies in the liver positively correlated with plasma (R = 0.698; P = 0.015) and liver (R = 0.567; P = 0.057) viral loads. Finally, soluble factors associated with NK cells and DCs, including gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and RANTES, were increased in acute infection and also were associated with viral loads and hepatitis. Collectively, the findings showed that mobilization of local and circulating innate immune responses was linked to acute virus-induced hepatitis, and potentially to resolution of GBV-B infection, and our results may provide insight into similar mechanisms in HCV infection.--NEW SECTION--Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has created a global health crisis, and despite new effective antivirals, it is still a leading cause of liver disease and death worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that innate immunity may be a potential therapeutic target for HCV, but it may also be a correlate of increased disease. Due to a lack of access to human tissues with acute HCV infection, in this study we evaluated the role of innate immunity in resolving infection with a hepacivirus, GBV-B, in common marmosets. Collectively, our data suggest that NK cell and DC mobilization in acute hepacivirus infection can dampen virus replication but also regulate acute and chronic liver damage. How these two opposing effects on the host may be modulated in future therapeutic and vaccine approaches warrants further study.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The primary outcome was the change in the number of school dropouts due to pregnancy from 1 year before to 1 year after the interventions.--NEW SECTION--Annual incidence of school dropout due to pregnancy decreased by 46% in the intervention schools (from 3.9% at baseline to 2.1% at follow-up), whereas the comparison schools remained essentially unchanged ( p < .029). Sensitivity analysis shows that the findings are robust to small levels of unobserved bias.--NEW SECTION--Results suggest that these behavioral interventions significantly reduced the number of school dropouts due to pregnancy.

African-Americans are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality from lupus. Self-management programs have demonstrated significant improvements in health distress, self-reported global health, and activity limitation among people with lupus. Despite benefits, arthritis self-management education has reached only a limited number of people. Self-selection of program could improve such trends. The aim of the current study is to test a novel intervention to improve quality of life, decrease indicators of depression, and reduce perceived and biological indicators of stress in African-American lupus patients in South Carolina.--NEW SECTION--In a three armed randomized, wait list controlled trial, we will evaluate the effectiveness of a patient-centered 'a-la-carte' approach that offers subjects a variety of modes of interaction from which they can choose as many or few as they wish, compared to a 'set menu' approach and usual care. This unique 'a-la-carte' self-management program will be offered to 50 African-American lupus patients participating in a longitudinal observational web-based SLE Database at the Medical University of South Carolina. Each individualized intervention plan will include 1-4 options, including a mail-delivered arthritis kit, addition and access to an online message board, participation in a support group, and enrollment in a local self-management program. A 'set menu' control group of 50 lupus patients will be offered a standardized chronic disease self-management program only, and a control group of 50 lupus patients will receive usual care. Outcomes will include changes in (a) health behaviors, (b) health status, (c) health care utilization, and (d) biological markers (urinary catecholamines).--NEW SECTION--Such a culturally sensitive educational intervention which includes self-selection of program components has the potential to improve disparate trends in quality of life, disease activity, depression, and stress among African-American lupus patients, as better outcomes have been documented when participants are able to choose/dictate the content and/or pace of the respective treatment/intervention program. Since there is currently no ""gold standard"" self-management program specifically for lupus, this project may have a considerable impact on future research and policy decisions.--NEW SECTION--NCT01837875 ; April 18, 2013.",eng,BMC health services research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

While progress has been made to improve TB cure rates, South Africa's 76 % smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB) case cure rate remains below the WHO target of 85 %. We report on the trends of TB smear non-conversion and their predictors at the end of an intensive phase of treatment, and how this impacted on treatment outcomes of smear-positive PTB cases in Eden District, Western Cape Province, South Africa.--NEW SECTION--Routinely collected, retrospective data of smear-positive PTB cases from the electronic TB register in Eden District between 2007 and 2013 was extracted. Non-conversion was defined as persistent sputum smear-positive PTB cases at the end of the two or three month intensive phase of treatment. Chi-square test for linear trend and simple linear regression analysis were used to analyse the change in percentages and slope of TB smear non-conversion rates over time. Risk factors for TB non-conversion, and their impact on treatment outcomes, were evaluated using logistic regression models.--NEW SECTION--Of 12,742 total smear-positive PTB cases included in our study, 12.8 % (n = 1627) did not sputum smear convert; 13.3 % (1411 of 10,574) of new cases and 9.9 % (216 of 2168) of re-treatment cases. Although not statistically significant in either new or re-treatment cases, between 2007 and 2013, smear non-conversion decreased from 16.4 to 12.7 % (slope = -0.60; 95 % CI: -1.49 to 0.29; p = 0.142) in new cases, and from 11.3 to 10.8 % in re-treatment cases (slope = -0.29; 95 % CI: -1.06 to 0.48; p = 0.376). Male gender, HIV co-infection and a >2+ acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear grading at the start of TB treatment were independent risk factors for non-conversion (p < 0.001). Age was a risk factor for non-conversion in new cases, but not for re-treatment cases. Non-conversion was also associated with unsuccessful treatment outcomes (p < 0.01), including treatment default and treatment failure.--NEW SECTION--Smear-positive PTB cases, especially men and those with identified risk factors for non-conversion, should be closely monitored throughout their treatment period.

27484014,10.1016/j.breast.2016.07.006,Radiotherapy for breast cancer: The predictable consequences of an unmet need.,"Radiotherapy has had a transformative impact on the treatment of breast cancer, but is unavailable to the majority of breast cancer patients in low- and middle-income countries. In these settings, where many women present with advanced disease at an age when they are often the primary caregiver for their families, the lack of access to radiotherapy is particularly devastating. Until recently, this disparity has been largely neglected in the medical literature and it had been difficult to convince governments, industry, and policymakers of the importance of investing in radiotherapy, as well as broader cancer control strategies, in low-resource settings. The Lancet Radiotherapy Commission report published in 2015 challenged many assumptions about the affordability of radiotherapy treatment. Data from the Commission is presented here to support radiotherapy investment for breast cancer and discuss how the morbidity and premature mortality among adult women caused by breast cancer has a huge detrimental effect on both the health sector and the economy.",eng,"Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27482633,10.1111/1755-0998.12584,Arbovirus and insect-specific virus discovery in Kenya by novel six genera multiplex high-resolution melting analysis.,"A broad diversity of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of global health concern are endemic to East Africa, yet most surveillance efforts are limited to just a few key viral pathogens. Additionally, estimates of arbovirus diversity in the tropics are likely to be underestimated as their discovery has lagged significantly over past decades due to limitations in fast and sensitive arbovirus identification methods. Here, we developed a nearly pan-arbovirus detection assay that uses high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of RT-PCR products from highly multiplexed assays to differentiate broad diversities of arboviruses. We differentiated 15 viral culture controls and seven additional synthetic viral DNA sequence controls, within Flavivirus, Alphavirus, Nairovirus, Phlebovirus, Orthobunyavirus and Thogotovirus genera. Among Bunyamwera, sindbis, dengue and Thogoto virus serial dilutions, detection by multiplex RT-PCR-HRM was comparable to the gold standard Vero cell plaque assays. We applied our low-cost method for enhanced broad-range pathogen surveillance from mosquito samples collected in Kenya and identified diverse insect-specific viruses, including a new clade in anopheline mosquitoes, and Wesselsbron virus, an arbovirus that can cause viral haemorrhagic fever in humans and has not previously been isolated in Kenya, in Culex spp. and Anopheles coustani mosquitoes. Our findings demonstrate how multiplex RT-PCR-HRM can identify novel viral diversities and potential disease threats that may not be included in pathogen detection panels of routine surveillance efforts. This approach can be adapted to other pathogens to enhance disease surveillance and pathogen discovery efforts, as well as the study of pathogen diversity and viral evolutionary ecology.",eng,Molecular ecology resources,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

27481320,10.21037/apm.2016.06.03,The power of integration: radiotherapy and global palliative care.,"Radiotherapy (RT) is a powerful tool for the palliation of the symptoms of advanced cancer, although access to it is limited or absent in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There are multiple factors contributing to this, including assumptions about the economic feasibility of RT in LMICs, the logical challenges of building capacity to deliver it in those regions, and the lack of political support to drive change of this kind. It is encouraging that the problem of RT access has begun to be included in the global discourse on cancer control and that palliative care and RT have been incorporated into national cancer control plans in some LMICs. Further, RT twinning programs involving high- and low-resource settings have been established to improve knowledge transfer and exchange. However, without large-scale action, the consequences of limited access to RT in LMICs will become dire. The number of new cancer cases around the world is expected to double by 2030, with twice as many deaths occurring in LMICs as in high-income countries (HICs). A sustained and coordinated effort involving research, education, and advocacy is required to engage global institutions, universities, health care providers, policymakers, and private industry in the urgent need to build RT capacity and delivery in LMICs.",eng,Annals of palliative medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Natural substances that could be effective remedies for treatment of obesity, and which are relatively safe, are desired. The aim of this study was to examine the anti-obesity effect and the mechanism of ramalin in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. In this study, 3T3-L1 cells were treated with various concentrations of ramalin (1, 5, and 10 μg/ml). Ramalin reduced the accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, ramalin inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation by blocking adipogenic gene expression including CCAAT enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ (PPARγ), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), and leptin. The suppression of adipogenesis by ramalin was mediated through the inhibition of MAPK pathways. Ramalin also reduced the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Oral administration of ramalin (50 and 100 mg/kg) to HFD-fed mice reduced body weight gain and abdominal fat accumulation without changes in food intake. Ramalin also attenuated organ weight and basal serum level by inhibiting Iiver X receptors (LXRs), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA expression in HFD-fed mice. Taken together, these results indicate that ramalin inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and prevents HFD-induced obesity. The present study also provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the anti-obesity activity of ramalin and suggests that ramalin has the potential to prevent obesity.",eng,Chemico-biological interactions,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Maternal smoking in pregnancy has been suggested as a contributing factor. Our objective was to systematically review studies on this, thereby expanding the evidence base for this association.--NEW SECTION--Systematic review with meta-analysis, Prospero Registration number CRD42012002859. We searched PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Web of Science and the Grey literature. We included prevalence, cohort and cross-sectional studies involving full-term, singleton pregnancies. Published and unpublished studies through to 1 January 2015 in all languages, demonstrating an objective overweight outcome up until 18 years of age and data presented as an OR, were included. Quality assessment was undertaken using an adaption of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager V.5.3.--NEW SECTION--The meta-analysis included 39 studies of 236 687 children from Europe, Australia, North America and South America and Asia. Maternal smoking in pregnancy ranged from 5.5% to 38.7%, with the prevalence of overweight from 6.3% to 32.1% and obesity from 2.6% to 17%. Pooled adjusted ORs demonstrated an elevated odds of maternal smoking in pregnancy for childhood overweight (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.46, I2 45%) and childhood obesity (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.73, I2 24%).--NEW SECTION--Our results demonstrate an association between maternal prenatal smoking and childhood overweight.

27480542,10.1007/s11017-016-9372-x,The place of human rights and the common good in global health policy.,"This article offers an integrated account of two strands of global health justice: health-related human rights and health-related common goods. After sketching a general understanding of the nature of human rights, it proceeds to explain both how individual human rights are to be individuated and the content of their associated obligations specified. With respect to both issues, the human right to health is taken as the primary illustration. It is argued that (1) the individuation of the right to health is fixed by reference to the subject matter of its corresponding obligations, and not by the interests it serves, and (2) the specification of the content of that right must be properly responsive to thresholds of possibility and burden. The article concludes by insisting that human rights cannot constitute the whole of global health justice and that, in addition, other considerations-including the promotion of health-related global public goods-should also shape such policy. Moreover, the relationship between human rights and common goods should not be conceived as mutually exclusive. On the contrary, there sometimes exists an individual right to some aspect of a common good, including a right to benefit from health-related common goods such as programmes for securing herd immunity from diphtheria.",eng,Theoretical medicine and bioethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27480026,10.1038/srep30811,Genome Wide Association Study Identifies L3MBTL4 as a Novel Susceptibility Gene for Hypertension.,"Hypertension is a major global health burden and a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Although its heritability has been documented previously, contributing loci identified to date account for only a small fraction of blood pressure (BP) variation, which strongly suggests the existence of undiscovered variants. To identify novel variants, we conducted a three staged genetic study in 21,990 hypertensive cases and normotensive controls. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at three new genes (L3MBTL4 rs403814, Pmeta = 6.128 × 10(-9); LOC729251, and TCEANC) and seven SNPs at five previously reported genes were identified as being significantly associated with hypertension. Through functional analysis, we found that L3MBTL4 is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and up-regulated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats with ubiquitous over-expression of L3MBTL4 exhibited significantly elevated BP, increased thickness of the vascular media layer and cardiac hypertrophy. Mechanistically, L3MBTL4 over-expression could lead to down-regulation of latent transforming growth factor-β binding protein 1 (LTBP1), and phosphorylation activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, which is known to trigger the pathological progression of vascular remodeling and BP elevation. These findings pinpointed L3MBTL4 as a critical contributor to the development and progression of hypertension and uncovers a novel target for therapeutic intervention.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

With an annual incidence of 1.5 million new cases, CL is a global health concern mainly in developing countries. The treatment options for CL are numerous but none is optimal. Pentavalent antimonials despite their side effects remain the preferred choice since decades. Alternate new treatment options are being explored to expand the therapeutic armamentarium of CL. In this study, we intend to describe our therapeutic experience with intralesional amphotericin B in the treatment of CL in a series of Indian patients, hitherto not commonly used in old world CL (OWCL). We also endeavour to review the literature on the use of amphotericin B in OWCL. Five consecutive patients diagnosed with cutaneous leishmansis at the out-patient department of Dermatology, Government Medical College, Jammu were treated with weekly injections of intralesional amphotericin B (2.5 mg/mL). Treatment response was assessed at each visit and the cases were followed up for 6 months. All the five patients responded well to the treatment and remained recurrence-free during follow-up. Intralesional amphotericin B was found to be safe and effective treatment for OWCL.

We explore here the feasibility using patient-specific cardiac computer modeling to capture diastolic parameters in patients suffering from different degrees of systolic HF. Fifty eight patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy have undergone thorough clinical evaluation, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), heart catheterization, echocardiography, and cardiac biomarker assessment. A previously-introduced framework for creating multi-scale patient-specific cardiac models has been applied on all these patients. Novel parameters, such as global stiffness factor and maximum left ventricular active stress, representing cardiac active and passive tissue properties have been computed for all patients. Invasive pressure measurements from heart catheterization were then used to evaluate ventricular relaxation using the time constant of isovolumic relaxation Tau (τ). Parameters from heart catheterization and the multi-scale model have been evaluated and compared to patient clinical presentation. The model parameter global stiffness factor, representing diastolic passive tissue properties, is correlated significantly across the patient population with τ. This study shows that multi-modal cardiac models can successfully capture diastolic (dys) function, a prerequisite for future clinical trials on HF-pEF.",eng,"Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Social marketing programmes may sell subsidized products through commercial sector outlets, distribute appropriately priced products, deliver health services through social franchises and promote behaviours not dependent upon a product or service. We aimed to review evidence of the effectiveness of social marketing in low- and middle-income countries, focusing on major areas of investment in global health: HIV, reproductive health, child survival, malaria and tuberculosis. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo and ProQuest, using search terms linking social marketing and health outcomes for studies published from 1995 to 2013. Eligible studies used experimental or quasi-experimental designs to measure outcomes of behavioural factors, health behaviours and/or health outcomes in each health area. Studies were analysed by effect estimates and for application of social marketing benchmark criteria. After reviewing 18 974 records, 125 studies met inclusion criteria. Across health areas, 81 studies reported on changes in behavioural factors, 97 studies reported on changes in behaviour and 42 studies reported on health outcomes. The greatest number of studies focused on HIV outcomes (n = 45) and took place in sub-Saharan Africa (n = 67). Most studies used quasi-experimental designs and reported mixed results. Child survival had proportionately the greatest number of studies using experimental designs, reporting health outcomes, and reporting positive, statistically significant results. Most programmes used a range of methods to promote behaviour change. Programmes with positive, statistically significant findings were more likely to apply audience insights and cost-benefit analyses to motivate behaviour change. Key evidence gaps were found in voluntary medical male circumcision and childhood pneumonia. Social marketing can influence health behaviours and health outcomes in global health; however evaluations assessing health outcomes remain comparatively limited. Global health investments are needed to (i) fill evidence gaps, (ii) strengthen evaluation rigour and (iii) expand effective social marketing approaches.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Rates of caesarean section overall in Latin America are approximately 35%, increasing up to 85% in some cases. There are many factors related to poor outcomes with regard to maternal and newborn/infant health in LAC countries. Maternal and perinatal outcome data within and between countries is scarce and inaccurate. The aims of this study were to: i) describe selected obstetric and neonatal outcomes of women who received midwifery care, ii) identify the level of maternal well-being after experiencing midwifery care in 6 Latin America countries.--NEW SECTION--this was a cross sectional and descriptive study, conducted in selected maternity units in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Peru, and Uruguay. Quantitative methods were used to measure midwifery processes of care and maternal perceptions of well-being in labour and childbirth through a validated survey of maternal well-being and an adapted version of the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) standardized antepartum and intrapartum data set.--NEW SECTION--Maternity units from 6 Latin American countries.--NEW SECTION--the final sample was a convenience sample, and the total participants for all sites in the six countries was 3009 low risk women.--NEW SECTION--for the countries reporting, overall, 82% of these low risk women had spontaneous vaginal deliveries. The rate of caesarean section was 16%; the Dominican Republic had the highest rate of Caesarean sections (30%) and Peru had the lowest rate (4%). The use of oxytocin in labour was widely variable, although overall there was a high proportion of women whose labour was augmented or induced. Ambulation was common, with the lowest proportion (48%) of women ambulating in labour in Chile, Uruguay (50%), Peru (65%), Brazil (85%). The presence of continuous support was highest in Uruguay (93%), Chile (75%) and Argentina (55%), and Peru had the lowest (22%). Episiotomies are still prevalent in all countries, the lowest rate was reported in the Dominican Republic (22%), and the highest rates were 52 and 53% (Chile and Peru, respectively).

Excess adiposity in childhood creates a predisposition to develop adult hypertension. Our aim was to explore distinct sex-specific adiposity trajectories from childhood to late adolescence and examined their association with blood pressure.--NEW SECTION--Latent Class Growth Mixture Modeling (LCGMM) on longitudinal data was used to derive sex-specific and distinct body mass index (BMI: kg/m(2)) trajectories. We studied 1824 black children (boys = 877, girls = 947) from the Birth to Twenty (Bt20) cohort from Soweto, South Africa, and obtained BMI measures at ages 5 through 18 years. Participants with at least two age-point BMI measures, were included in the analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square test, multivariate linear and standard logistic regressions were used to test study characteristics and different associations.--NEW SECTION--We identified three (3) and four (4) distinct BMI trajectories in boys and girls, respectively. The overall prevalence of elevated blood pressure (BP) was 34.9 % (39.4 % in boys and 30.38 % in girls). Boys and girls in the early onset obesity or overweight BMI trajectories were more likely to have higher BP values in late adolescence. Compared to those in the normal weight BMI trajectory, girls in early onset obesity trajectories had an increased risk of elevated BP with odds ratio (OR) of 2.18 (95 % confidence interval 1.31 to 4.20) and 1.95 (1.01 to 3.77). We also observed the weak association for boys in early onset overweight trajectory, (p-value = 0.18 and odds ratio of 2.39 (0.67 to 8.57)) CONCLUSIONS: Distinct weight trajectories are observed in black South African children from as early as 5 years. Early onset adiposity trajectories are associated with elevated BP in both boys and girls.

The basis for this assumption is doubtful, and secular trends (that is, gradual decreases or increases in prevalence over long-term periods) are perfectly plausible.--NEW SECTION--We carried out a systematic review of studies of trends in prevalence, incidence and mortality for people with dementia, conducted since 1980.--NEW SECTION--We identified nine studies that had tracked dementia prevalence, eight that had tracked dementia incidence, and four that had tracked mortality among people with dementia. There was some moderately consistent evidence to suggest that the incidence of dementia may be declining in high-income countries. Evidence on trends in the prevalence of dementia were inconsistent across studies and did not suggest any clear overall effect. Declining incidence may be balanced by longer survival with dementia, although mortality trends have been little studied. There is some evidence to suggest increasing prevalence in East Asia, consistent with worsening cardiovascular risk factor profiles, although secular changes in diagnostic criteria may also have contributed.--NEW SECTION--We found no evidence to suggest that the current assumption of constant age-specific prevalence of dementia over time is ill-founded. However, there remains some uncertainty as to the future scale of the dementia epidemic. Population ageing seems destined to play the greatest role, and prudent policymakers should plan future service provision based upon current prevalence projections.

PLWHA go to healers when facing limited solutions in health system. There are fewer associations for TB patients, and less education and sensitization sessions to give them opportunity for sharing disease status and learning from other TB patients. TB patients and PLWHA still need to better understand their disease and its implication. Access to care (diagnosis and treatment) remains one of the key issues in health system, especially for PLWHA.

In adolescents and adults, the number of patients cured increased with increasing tribendimidine doses up to 100 mg: ten of 39 patients (25·6%, 95% CI 13·0-42·1) were cured in the 25 mg group, 20 of 47 patients (42·6%, 28·3-57·8) were cured in the 50 mg group, and 34 of 44 patients (77·3%, 62·2-88·5) were cured in the 100 mg group; geometric mean egg reduction rates were 86·9% (95% CI 74·8-93·4), 95·9% (92·7-97·7), and 99·1% (98·2-99·7), respectively. The 200 mg dose resulted in cure in 40 of 47 (83·0%, 69·2-92·5) adolescents and adults given the 200 mg tablet and 25 of 41 (61·0%, 95% CI 44·5-75·8) of those given four 50 mg tablets; the 400 mg dose resulted in cure in 43 of 47 patients (91·5%, 79·6-97·6) and the 600 mg dose resulted in cure in 36 of 45 patients (80·0%, 65·4-90·4). Corresponding egg reduction rates were 99·8% (95% CI 99·7-100·0) with one 200 mg tablet, 97·9% (95·9-99·2) with four 50 mg tablets, 99·9% (99·8-100·0) with 400 mg, and 99·8% (99·6-99·9) with 600 mg. The Emax model predicted an egg reduction rate of 99·0% (95% CI 95·7-99·8) at 111 mg in adolescents and adults. 50 mg tribendimidine had moderate efficacy in children, with cure recorded in 16 of 39 patients (41·0%, 95% CI 25·6-57·9). The 100 mg dose resulted in cure in 40 of 44 children (98·9%, 95% CI 78·3-97·5) and an egg reduction rate of 99·7% (95% CI 99·0-100·0), with no increased efficacy at higher doses. The Emax model predicted an egg reduction rate of 99·0% (95% CI 92·2-99·9) at 215 mg. Few adverse events were reported and were mostly mild, with few moderate and no serious events. The most common adverse events 3 h after treatment in adolescents and adults were vertigo (n=35 [11%]), headache (n=9 [3%]), nausea (n=6 [2%]), and fatigue (n=4 [1%]), and in children were headache (n=3 [2%]), vertigo (n=2 [1%]), and fatigue (n=2 [1%]).--NEW SECTION--Tribendimidine has excellent efficacy and tolerability at doses of 100 mg and above.

A major portion of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) consisted of two clinical trials involving 161,809 post-menopausal women aged 50-79 that tested the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on reducing cardiovascular disease and other secondary outcomes. Previous analyses of the data reveal that HRT should not be recommended for post-menopausal women, but show potential benefits for younger women. Thus, there may be a critical period just prior to or during the early stages of menopause where HRT could be both safe and beneficial.--NEW SECTION--Menopause marks the beginning of a process of non-reversible reduction in estrogen by which estrogen levels decline progressively, followed by a reduction in estrogen receptors. This results in periods of hormone-receptor imbalances, exacerbating the effects of lower serum estrogen and is considered the primarily endocrinal source of menopause symptoms. Eventually a hormone-receptor balance is achieved at a lower level.Here, we purport that the negative outcomes from WHI trials were primarily due to the fact preventive HRT was initiated in women who had already achieved hormone-receptor equilibrium at lower hormonal levels.--NEW SECTION--We argue for further HRT clinical trials in women at varying stages of menopause, including pre-menopause and early menopause, and in women from different countries. Variation across countries and subgroups in how women experience menopause and perceive menopause symptoms suggest that biocultural differences should be considered in both study design and measurement approaches to test the effectiveness of HRT. Particularly, we recommend longitudinal studies to assess changes in hormonal level over time, and to detect the ""most effective period"" for HRT to reduce health risk for women going through the whole menopause period.",eng,Global health research and policy,Editorial,2025-04-23,2016

Despite the potential for family medicine to be a major contributor to GH, there are no recent, large-scale studies of GH education and experiences in family medicine training. This study was designed to assess current opportunities, educational activities, resident interest, perceived program benefits, and barriers to international and domestic GH training in US family medicine residencies.--NEW SECTION--Data for this study were elicited as part of a 2015 survey conducted by the Council of Academic Family Medicine (CAFM) Educational Research Alliance (CERA). The nationwide, web-based survey was sent to 452 family medicine residency program directors.--NEW SECTION--A total of 257 program directors completed the GH portion of the survey. A total of 74.3% of programs offered international or domestic GH experiences. Program directors identified preparing physicians to practice underserved medicine and teaching community medicine or public health as primary goals for GH training. Program directors also reported that GH opportunities were important for attracting future residents. Programs offered a variety of preparatory activities to their residents.

The development was strongest among lower middle-income countries. Lack of state capacity was associated with lower likelihood of countries implementing complete advertising bans. Implementation of complete advertising bans slowed after 2007.--NEW SECTION--Implementation of FCTC Article 13 was followed by increased progress towards complete advertising bans, but progress is incomplete, especially among low-income countries. Low-income countries need comprehensive support to implement FCTC as part of a broad effort to reinvigorate progress on global implementation of the FCTC.

We integrate findings from human sleep studies, the ethnographic record, and the ecology and evolution of mammalian sleep to better understand sleep along the human lineage and in the modern world. Compared to other primates, sleep in great apes has undergone substantial evolutionary change, with all great apes building a sleeping platform or 'nest'. Further evolutionary change characterizes human sleep, with humans having the shortest sleep duration, yet the highest proportion of rapid eye movement sleep among primates. These changes likely reflect that our ancestors experienced fitness benefits from being active for a greater portion of the 24-h cycle than other primates, potentially related to advantages arising from learning, socializing and defending against predators and hostile conspecifics. Perspectives from evolutionary medicine have implications for understanding sleep disorders; we consider these perspectives in the context of insomnia, narcolepsy, seasonal affective disorder, circadian rhythm disorders and sleep apnea. We also identify how human sleep today differs from sleep through most of human evolution, and the implications of these changes for global health and health disparities. More generally, our review highlights the importance of phylogenetic comparisons in understanding human health, including well-known links between sleep, cognitive performance and health in humans.",eng,"Evolution, medicine, and public health",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This paper is concerned with neglected tropical disease control, which prescribes annual mass drug administration to interrupt transmission of, among others, lymphatic filariasis. In Tanzania, this intervention is conducted through community-directed distribution, which aims to improve drug uptake by promoting community participation and local ownership in the intervention. However, the average uptake of drugs often remains too low to achieve the intended interruption of transmission. The qualitative research presented here followed the implementation of mass drug administration in Lindi and Morogoro Regions, Tanzania, in 2011 to understand the different forms of involvement in the campaign and the experiences of stakeholders of their part in community-directed distribution. Some health care workers, community leaders and drug distributors were generally positive about the intervention, emphasizing that the drugs were welcome. Other stakeholders, including the drug-receiving population, reported facing a number of dilemmas of uncertainty, authority and exclusion pertaining to their roles in the intervention. These dilemmas should be of interest to donors, policymakers and implementers. Community-directed distribution relies on social relations between the many different stakeholders. Successful and justifiable interventions for lymphatic filariasis require implementers to recognize the central role of sociality and that the voices and priorities of people count.",eng,Journal of biosocial science,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Heightened risk of non-communicable diseases (NCD) in children exposed to SAM at around 2 years of age is plausible in view of previously described consequences of other early nutritional insults. By applying developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) theory to this group, we aimed to explore the long-term effects of SAM.--NEW SECTION--We followed up 352 Malawian children (median age 9·3 years) who were still alive following SAM inpatient treatment between July 12, 2006, and March 7, 2007, (median age 24 months) and compared them with 217 sibling controls and 184 age-and-sex matched community controls. Our outcomes of interest were anthropometry, body composition, lung function, physical capacity (hand grip, step test, and physical activity), and blood markers of NCD risk. For comparisons of all outcomes, we used multivariable linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, HIV status, and socioeconomic status. We also adjusted for puberty in the body composition regression model.--NEW SECTION--Compared with controls, children who had survived SAM had lower height-for-age Z scores (adjusted difference vs community controls 0·4, 95% CI 0·6 to 0·2, p=0·001; adjusted difference vs sibling controls 0·2, 0·0 to 0·4, p=0·04), although they showed evidence of catch-up growth. These children also had shorter leg length (adjusted difference vs community controls 2·0 cm, 1·0 to 3·0, p<0·0001; adjusted difference vs sibling controls 1·4 cm, 0·5 to 2·3, p=0·002), smaller mid-upper arm circumference (adjusted difference vs community controls 5·6 mm, 1·9 to 9·4, p=0·001; adjusted difference vs sibling controls 5·7 mm, 2·3 to 9·1, p=0·02), calf circumference (adjusted difference vs community controls 0·49 cm, 0·1 to 0·9, p=0·01; adjusted difference vs sibling controls 0·62 cm, 0·2 to 1·0, p=0·001), and hip circumference (adjusted difference vs community controls 1·56 cm, 0·5 to 2·7, p=0·01; adjusted difference vs sibling controls 1·83 cm, 0·8 to 2·8, p<0·0001), and less lean mass (adjusted difference vs community controls -24·5, -43 to -5·5, p=0·01; adjusted difference vs sibling controls -11·5, -29 to -6, p=0·19) than did either sibling or community controls. Survivors of SAM had functional deficits consisting of weaker hand grip (adjusted difference vs community controls -1·7 kg, 95% CI -2·4 to -0·9, p<0·0001; adjusted difference vs sibling controls 1·01 kg, 0·3 to 1·7, p=0·005,)) and fewer minutes completed of an exercise test (sibling odds ratio [OR] 1·59, 95% CI 1·0 to 2·5, p=0·04; community OR 1·59, 95% CI 1·0 to 2·5, p=0·05). We did not detect significant differences between cases and controls in terms of lung function, lipid profile, glucose tolerance, glycated haemoglobin A1c, salivary cortisol, sitting height, and head circumference.--NEW SECTION--Our results suggest that SAM has long-term adverse effects. Survivors show patterns of so-called thrifty growth, which is associated with future cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The evidence of catch-up growth and largely preserved cardiometabolic and pulmonary functions suggest the potential for near-full rehabilitation. Future follow-up should try to establish the effects of puberty and later dietary or social transitions on these parameters, as well as explore how best to optimise recovery and quality of life for survivors.--NEW SECTION--The Wellcome Trust.",eng,The Lancet.

In this report from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we provide national estimates of levels and trends of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and mortality for 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015.--NEW SECTION--For countries without high-quality vital registration data, we estimated prevalence and incidence with data from antenatal care clinics and population-based seroprevalence surveys, and with assumptions by age and sex on initial CD4 distribution at infection, CD4 progression rates (probability of progression from higher to lower CD4 cell-count category), on and off antiretroviral therapy (ART) mortality, and mortality from all other causes. Our estimation strategy links the GBD 2015 assessment of all-cause mortality and estimation of incidence and prevalence so that for each draw from the uncertainty distribution all assumptions used in each step are internally consistent. We estimated incidence, prevalence, and death with GBD versions of the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) and Spectrum software originally developed by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). We used an open-source version of EPP and recoded Spectrum for speed, and used updated assumptions from systematic reviews of the literature and GBD demographic data. For countries with high-quality vital registration data, we developed the cohort incidence bias adjustment model to estimate HIV incidence and prevalence largely from the number of deaths caused by HIV recorded in cause-of-death statistics. We corrected these statistics for garbage coding and HIV misclassification.--NEW SECTION--Global HIV incidence reached its peak in 1997, at 3·3 million new infections (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1-3·4 million). Annual incidence has stayed relatively constant at about 2·6 million per year (range 2·5-2·8 million) since 2005, after a period of fast decline between 1997 and 2005. The number of people living with HIV/AIDS has been steadily increasing and reached 38·8 million (95% UI 37·6-40·4 million) in 2015. At the same time, HIV/AIDS mortality has been declining at a steady pace, from a peak of 1·8 million deaths (95% UI 1·7-1·9 million) in 2005, to 1·2 million deaths (1·1-1·3 million) in 2015. We recorded substantial heterogeneity in the levels and trends of HIV/AIDS across countries. Although many countries have experienced decreases in HIV/AIDS mortality and in annual new infections, other countries have had slowdowns or increases in rates of change in annual new infections.--NEW SECTION--Scale-up of ART and prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been one of the great successes of global health in the past two decades. However, in the past decade, progress in reducing new infections has been slow, development assistance for health devoted to HIV has stagnated, and resources for health in low-income countries have grown slowly. Achievement of the new ambitious goals for HIV enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 3 and the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets will be challenging, and will need continued efforts from governments and international agencies in the next 15 years to end AIDS by 2030.--NEW SECTION--Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute of Mental Health and National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health.",eng,The lancet.

To date few studies have examined obesity in India and most have only looked at prevalence estimates. While studies in Western countries have identified parent weight status as a predictor of child weight status, there have been no studies examining this association in India. This study examined the relationship between parent weight status and child weight status using an internationally representative growth reference for children and Asian-specific action points for adults. Overall, this study found 29.6% of children and 77.7% of parents in a sample of private schools in Delhi, India were overweight/obese. Parent weight status was found to be associated with child weight status after controlling for child grade and sex. However, while maternal weight status was associated with child weight status (odds ratio=1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-2.20), paternal weight status was not (odds ratio=1.10, 95% confidence interval: 0.81-1.48). The association was greatest between mothers and sons (odds ratio=2.13, 95% confidence interval: 1.39-3.27). These results provide initial evidence that parent weight status is associated with child weight status in Delhi, India. Future research should continue to explore the relationship between parent, particularly maternal, and child weight status to better understand the nature of the relationship and the differences between male and female children.

Recent studies in GC have confirmed that it is a heterogeneous disease. Many molecular characterization studies have been performed in GC. Recent discoveries of the molecular pathways underlying the disease have opened the door to more personalized treatment and better predictable outcome. The identification of molecular markers is a useful tool for clinical managementin GC patients, assisting in diagnosis, evaluation of response to treatment and development of novel therapeutic modalities. While chemotherapeutic agents have certain physiological effects on the tumor cells, the prediction of the response is different from one type of tumor to the other.

Street vending and waste picking are the dominant works undertaken by the urban poor, and besides the physical hazards, it also exposes them to several pathogens and high levels of air pollutants present in the outdoor environment. The situation has severe consequences for the health of the workers. Eliminating these occupational activities from the urban landscape of developing countries should therefore receive urgent attention from the global health community and governments. In this article, we provide evidence to support this policy recommendation by documenting exposure experiences of the workers, the associated adverse health effects, whilst also outlining measures for addressing the problem sustainably. We conclude that with the adoption of the sustainable development goals (SDG), governments now have a commitment to address poverty and the associated occupational health hazards experienced by the poor through their choices to help achieve the health-related SDG target (3.9) of substantially reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination by 2030.",eng,International journal of occupational and environmental health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Phase I assessed criterion validity of OTT on all patients arriving at an American university hospital by comparing agreement among three methods of triage: OTT, Emergency Severity Index (ESI) and physician-defined acuity (the gold standard). Agreement was reported in normalised and raw-weighted Cohen κ using two different scales for weighting, Expert-weighted and triage-weighted κ. Phase II tested reliability, reported in Fleiss κ, of OTT using standardised cases among three groups of providers at an urban and rural Cambodian hospital and the American university hospital.--NEW SECTION--Normalised for prevalence of patients in each category, OTT and ESI performed similarly well for expert-weighted κ (OTT κ=0.58, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.65; ESI κ=0.47, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.53) and triage-weighted κ (κ=0.54, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.61; ESI κ=0.57, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.64).

Alarmingly, the spread of drug-resistant parasites threatens the effectiveness of current antimalarials and has made the development of novel therapeutic strategies a global health priority. Malaria parasites have a complicated lifecycle, involving an asymptomatic 'liver stage' and a symptomatic 'blood stage'. During the blood stage, the parasites utilise a proteolytic cascade to digest host hemoglobin, which produces free amino acids absolutely necessary for parasite growth and reproduction. The enzymes required for hemoglobin digestion are therefore attractive therapeutic targets. The final step of the cascade is catalyzed by several metalloaminopeptidases, including aminopeptidase P (APP). We developed a novel platform to examine the substrate fingerprint of APP from Plasmodium falciparum (PfAPP) and to show that it can catalyze the removal of any residue immediately prior to a proline. Further, we have determined the crystal structure of PfAPP and present the first examination of the 3D structure of this essential malarial enzyme.

In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century, whose average heights surpassed 182.5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 (140.3 cm; 135.8-144.8). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19-20 cm a century ago, and has remained the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27458397,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00983,Characterization of Vulnerable and Resilient Spanish Adolescents in Their Developmental Contexts.,"Research on resilience and vulnerability can offer very valuable information for optimizing design and assessment of interventions and policies aimed at fostering adolescent health. This paper used the adversity level associated with family functioning and the positive adaptation level, as measured by means of a global health score, to distinguish four groups within a representative sample of Spanish adolescents aged 13-16 years: maladaptive, resilient, competent and vulnerable. The aforementioned groups were compared in a number of demographic, school context, peer context, lifestyles, psychological and socioeconomic variables, which can facilitate or inhibit positive adaptation in each context. In addition, the degree to which each factor tended to associate with resilience and vulnerability was examined. The majority of the factors operated by increasing the likelihood of good adaptation in resilient adolescents and diminishing it in vulnerable ones. Overall, more similarities than differences were found in the factors contributing to explaining resilience or vulnerability. However, results also revealed some differential aspects: psychological variables showed a larger explicative capacity in vulnerable adolescents, whereas factors related to school and peer contexts, especially the second, showed a stronger association with resilience. In addition, perceived family wealth, satisfaction with friendships and breakfast frequency only made a significant contribution to the explanation of resilience. The current study provides a highly useful characterization of resilience and vulnerability phenomena in adolescence.",eng,Frontiers in psychology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

These lifestyles often persist from generation to generation and contribute to a vicious cycle of health-related and social problems. This design article presents a study evaluating the effects of two novel healthy school interventions. The main outcome measure will be changes in children's body mass index (BMI). In addition, lifestyle behaviours, academic achievement, child well-being, socio-economic differences, and societal costs will be examined.--NEW SECTION--In close collaboration with various stakeholders, a quasi-experimental study was developed, for which children of four intervention schools (n = 1200) in the southern part of the Netherlands are compared with children of four control schools (n = 1200) in the same region. The interventions started in November 2015. In two of the four intervention schools, a whole-school approach named 'The Healthy Primary School of the Future', is implemented with the aim of improving physical activity and dietary behaviour. For this intervention, pupils are offered an extended curriculum, including a healthy lunch, more physical exercises, and social and educational activities, next to the regular school curriculum. In the two other intervention schools, a physical-activity school approach called 'The Physical Activity School', is implemented, which is essentially similar to the other intervention, except that no lunch is provided. The interventions proceed during a period of 4 years. Apart from the effectiveness of both interventions, the process, the cost-effectiveness, and the expected legal implications are studied. Data collection is conducted within the school system. The baseline measurements started in September 2015 and yearly follow-up measurements are taking place until 2019.--NEW SECTION--A whole-school approach is a new concept in the Netherlands. Due to its innovative, multifaceted nature and sound scientific foundation, these integrated programmes have the potential to form a template for primary schools worldwide. The effects of this approach may extend further than the outcomes associated with well-being and academic achievement, potentially impacting legal and cultural aspects in our society.--NEW SECTION--The study protocol was registered in the database ClinicalTrials.gov on 14-06-2016 with the reference number NCT02800616 .",eng,BMC public health,Clinical Trial,2025-04-23,2016
27456540,10.1111/nup.12143,Developing the concept of sustainability in nursing.,"Sustainability, and the related concept of climate change, is an emerging domain within nursing and nurse education. Climate change has been posited as a serious global health threat requiring action by health professionals and action at international level. Anåker & Elf undertook a concept analysis of sustainability in nursing based on Walker and Avant's framework. Their main conclusions seem to be that while defining attributes and cases can be established, there is not enough research into sustainability in the nursing literature. This paper seeks to develop their argument to argue that sustainability in nursing can be better understood by accessing non-nursing and grey literature and, for example, the literature in the developing web-based 'paraversity'. Without this understanding, and application in nursing scholarship, nurses will have a rather narrow understanding of sustainability and its suggested links with social and health inequalities and the dynamics underpinning unsustainable neoliberalist political economy. This understanding is based on the social and political determinants of health approach and the emerging domain of planetary health. However, this is a major challenge as it requires a critical reflection on what counts as nursing knowledge, a reflection which might reject sustainability and political economy as irrelevant to much of nursing practice.",eng,Nursing philosophy : an international journal for healthcare professionals,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27454907,10.1186/s12913-016-1451-1,"Perspectives on health policy dialogue: definition, perceived importance and coordination.","Countries in the World Health Organization African Region have witnessed an increase in global health initiatives in the recent past. Although these have provided opportunities for expanding coverage of health interventions; their poor alignment with the countries' priorities and weak coordination, are among the challenges that have affected their impact. A well-coordinated health policy dialogue provides an opportunity to address these challenges, but calls for common understanding among stakeholders of what policy dialogue entails. This paper seeks to assess stakeholders' understanding and perceived importance of health policy dialogue and of policy dialogue coordination.--NEW SECTION--This was a cross-sectional descriptive study using qualitative methods. Interviews were conducted with 90 key informants from the national and sub-national levels in Lusophone Cabo Verde, Francophone Chad, Guinea and Togo, and Anglophone Liberia using an open-ended interview guide. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded and then put through inductive thematic content analysis using QRS software Version 10.--NEW SECTION--There were variations in the definition of policy dialogue that were not necessarily linked to the linguistic leaning of respondents' countries or whether the dialogue took place at the national or sub-national level. The definitions were grouped into five categories based on whether they had an outcome, operational, process, forum or platform, or interactive and evidence-sharing orientation. The stakeholders highlighted multiple benefits of policy dialogue including ensuring stakeholder participation, improving stakeholder harmonisation and alignment, supporting implementation of health policies, fostering continued institutional learning, providing a guiding framework and facilitating stakeholder analysis.--NEW SECTION--Policy dialogue offers the opportunity to improve stakeholder participation in policy development and promote aid effectiveness. However, conceptual clarity is needed to ensure pursuance of common objectives. While it is clear that stakeholder involvement is an important component of policy dialogue, numbers must be manageable for meaningful dialogue. Ownership and coordination of the policy dialogue are important aspects of the process, and building the institutional capacity of the ministry of health requires a comprehensive approach as opposed to strengthening selected departments within it. Likewise, capacity for policy dialogue needs to be built at the sub-national level, alongside improving the bottom-up approach in policy processes.",eng,BMC health services research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27454656,10.1186/s12913-016-1449-8,An analytical perspective of Global health initiatives in Tanzania and Zambia.,"A number of Global health initiatives (GHIs) have been created to support low and middle income countries. Their support has been of different forms. The African Region has benefitted immensely from GHIs and continues to register an increase in health partnerships and initiatives. However, information on the functioning and operationalisation of GHIs in the countries is limited.--NEW SECTION--This study involved two country case studies, one in Tanzania and the other one in Zambia. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. The aims were to understand and profile the GHIs supporting health development and to assess their governance and alignment with country priorities, harmonisation and alignment of their interventions and efforts, and contribution towards health systems strengthening. The respondents included senior officers from health stakeholder agencies at the national and sub-national levels. The qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis in MAXQDA software.--NEW SECTION--Health systems in both Tanzania and Zambia are decentralised. They have benefitted from GHI support in fighting the common health problems of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and vaccine-preventable diseases. In both countries, no GHI adequately made use of the existing Sector-wide Approach (SWAp) mechanisms but they largely operate through their unique structures and committees. GHI efforts to improve general health governance have not been matched with similar efforts from the countries. Their support to health system strengthening has not been comprehensive but has involved the selection of a few areas some of which were disease-focused. On the positive side, however, in both Tanzania and Zambia improved alignment with the countries' priorities is noted in that most of the proposals submitted to the GHIs refer to the priorities, objectives and strategies in the national health development plans and, GHIs depend on the national health information systems.--NEW SECTION--GHIs are important funders of health in low and middle income countries. However, there is a need for the countries to take a proactive role in improving the governance, coordination and planning of the GHIs that they benefit from. This will also maximise the return on investment for the GHIs.",eng,BMC health services research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Over the last decade, the African Region has realised improvements in health outcomes as a result of interventions implemented by both governments and development partners. However, alignment and harmonisation of partnerships and GHIs are still difficult in the African countries with inadequate capacity for their effective coordination.--NEW SECTION--Both published and grey literature was reviewed to understand the governance, priorities, harmonisation and alignment of GHIs in the African Region; to synthesise the knowledge and highlight the persistent challenges; and to identify gaps for future research.--NEW SECTION--GHI governance structures are often separate from those of the countries in which they operate. Their divergent funding channels and modalities may have contributed to the failure of governments to track their resources. There is also evidence that basically, earmarking and donor conditions drive funding allocations regardless of countries' priorities. Although studies cite the lack of harmonisation of GHI priorities with national strategies, evidence shows improvements in that area over time. GHIs have used several strategies and mechanisms to involve the private sector. These have widened the pool of health service policy-makers and providers to include groups such as civil society organisations (CSOs), with both positive and negative implications. GHI strategies such as co-financing by countries as a condition for support have been positive in achieving sustainability of interventions.--NEW SECTION--GHI approaches have not changed substantially over the years but there has been evolution in terms of donor funding and conditions. GHIs still largely operate in a vertical manner, bypassing country systems; they compete for the limited human resources; they influence country policies; and they are not always harmonised with other donors. To maximise returns on GHI support, there is need to ensure that their approaches are more comprehensive as opposed to being selective; to improve GHI country level governance and alignment with countries' changing epidemiologic profiles; and to strengthen their involvement of CSOs.",eng,BMC health services research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27452949,10.1093/heapol/czw096,Understanding and improving the one and three times GDP per capita cost-effectiveness thresholds.,"Researchers and policymakers have long been interested in developing simple decision rules to aid in determining whether an intervention is, or is not, cost-effective. In global health, interventions that impose costs per disability-adjusted life year averted less than three and one times gross domestic product per capita are often considered cost-effective and very cost-effective, respectively. This article explores the conceptual foundation and derivation of these thresholds. Its goal is to promote understanding of how these thresholds were derived and their implications, as well as to suggest options for improvement. These thresholds are intended to reflect the monetary value of the benefits to affected individuals, based on their preferences for spending on health vs spending on other goods and services. However, the current values were not rigorously derived, which means that their application may lead to inappropriate conclusions regarding which interventions should be adopted as well as misallocation of resources across health and other investments. Improving the basis for these cost-effectiveness thresholds is of particular importance in low- and middle-income countries, given the limited resources available and the significant needs of their populations.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Resource limitations make screening mammography or clinical breast examination (CBE) by physicians or nurses impractical in many settings. We aimed to assess feasibility and performance of CBE by laywomen in urban health clinics in Malawi.--NEW SECTION--Four laywomen were trained to deliver breast cancer educational talks and conduct CBE. After training, screening was implemented in diverse urban health clinics. Eligible women were ≥30 y, with no prior breast cancer or breast surgery, and clinic attendance for reasons other than a breast concern. Women with abnormal CBE were referred to a study surgeon. All palpable masses confirmed by surgeon examination were pathologically sampled. Patients with abnormal screening CBE but normal surgeon examination underwent breast ultrasound confirmation. In addition, 50 randomly selected women with normal screening CBE underwent breast ultrasound, and 45 different women with normal CBE were randomly assigned to surgeon examination.--NEW SECTION--Among 1220 eligible women, 1000 (82%) agreed to CBE. Lack of time (69%) was the commonest reason for refusal. Educational talk attendance was associated with higher CBE participation (83% versus 77%, P = 0.012). Among 1000 women screened, 7% had abnormal CBE. Of 45 women with normal CBE randomized to physician examination, 43 had normal examinations and two had axillary lymphadenopathy not detected by CBE. Sixty of 67 women (90%) with abnormal CBE attended the referral visit. Of these, 29 (48%) had concordant abnormal physician examination. Thirty-one women (52%) had discordant normal physician examination, all of whom also had normal breast ultrasounds. Compared with physician examination, sensitivity for CBE by laywomen was 94% (confidence interval [CI] 79%-99%), specificity 58% (CI, 46%-70%), positive predictive value 48% (CI, 35%-62%), and negative predictive value 96% (CI, 85%-100%). Of 13 women who underwent recommended pathologic sampling of a breast lesion, two had cytologic dysplasia and all others benign results.--NEW SECTION--CBE uptake in Lilongwe clinics was high. CBE by laywomen compared favorably with physician examination and follow-up was good. Our intervention can serve as a model for wider implementation.

This review describes the published literature on trends in syphilis infections among MSM in the US and Western Europe from 1998, the period with the fewest syphilis infections in both geographical areas, onwards. We also describe disparities in syphilis trends among various sub-populations of MSM. We searched electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Global Health, PsychInfo, CAB Abstracts, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and LILACS) for peer-reviewed journal articles that were published between January 2004 and June 2015 and reported on syphilis cases among MSM at multiple time points from 1998 onwards. Ten articles (12 syphilis trend studies/reports) from the US and eight articles (12 syphilis trend studies/reports) from Western Europe were identified and included in this review. Taken together, our findings indicate an increase in the numbers and rates (per 100,000) of syphilis infections among MSM in the US and Western Europe since 1998. Disparities in the syphilis trends among MSM were also noted, with greater increases observed among HIV-positive MSM than HIV-negative MSM in both the US and Western Europe. In the US, racial minority MSM and MSM between 20 and 29 years accounted for the greatest increases in syphilis infections over time whereas White MSM accounted for most syphilis infections over time in Western Europe. Multiple strategies, including strengthening and targeting current syphilis screening and testing programs, and the prompt treatment of syphilis cases are warranted to address the increase in syphilis infections among all MSM in the US and Western Europe, but particularly among HIV-infected MSM, racial minority MSM, and young MSM in the US.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial to allow appropriate and timely treatment. Current laboratory stool testing has a long turnaround time (TAT) and demands highly qualified personnel and multiple techniques. The need for high throughput and the number of possible enteric pathogens compels the implementation of a molecular approach which uses multiplex technology, without compromising performance requirements. In this work we evaluated the feasibility of the NanoCHIP® Gastrointestinal Panel (GIP) (Savyon Diagnostics, Ashdod, IL), a molecular microarray-based screening test, to be used in the routine workflow of our laboratory, a big outpatient microbiology laboratory. The NanoCHIP® GIP test provides simultaneous detection of nine major enteric bacteria and parasites: Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Giardia sp., Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba dispar, Dientamoeba fragilis, and Blastocystis spp. The required high-throughput was obtained by the NanoCHIP® detection system together with the MagNA Pure 96 DNA purification system (Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Switzerland). This combined system has demonstrated a higher sensitivity and detection yield compared to the conventional methods in both, retrospective and prospective samples. The identification of multiple parasites and bacteria in a single test also enabled increased efficiency of detecting mixed infections, as well as reduced hands-on time and work load. In conclusion, the combination of these two automated systems is a proper response to the laboratory needs in terms of improving laboratory workflow, turn-around-time, minimizing human errors and can be efficiently integrated in the routine work of the laboratory.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Chronic stress has also been shown to have immuno-suppressive effects and to accelerate immunosenescence. Exercise could be a significant factor in ameliorating the deleterious effects of chronic stress, but variables such as the type, intensity, and frequency of exercise that should be performed in order to effectively reduce the stress burden need to be defined clearly. PRO-HMECSI will allow us to investigate which hormonal and immunological parameters are able to mediate the effects of exercise on mucosal immunity, psychological/biological stress, and cognitive functioning in older people. Phase I consists of an observational cross-sectional study that compares elders groups (n = 223, >65 years) by functional fitness levels aiming to identify biomarkers involved in maintaining immune and mental health. Neuroendocrine and immune biomarkers of stress, psychological well-being related to mental health, neurocognitive function, functional fitness, and daily PA will be evaluated. Phase II consists of a 28-week intervention in elders with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) profile (n = 149, >65 years, divided in three groups of exercise and one control group), aiming to investigate whether the positive effect of three different types of chair-based exercise programs on physical and psychological health is mediated by an optimal endocrine environment.

27446074,10.3389/fimmu.2016.00243,Recent Advances in Lentiviral Vaccines for HIV-1 Infection.,"The development of an effective HIV vaccine to prevent and/or cure HIV remains a global health priority. Given their central role in the initiation of adaptive immune responses, dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines are being increasingly explored as immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance HIV-specific T cells in infected individuals and, thus, promote immune responses that may help facilitate a functional cure. HIV-1-based lentiviral (LV) vectors have inherent advantages as DC vaccine vectors due to their ability to transduce non-dividing cells and integrate into the target cell genomic DNA, allowing for expression of encoded antigens over the lifespan of the cell. Moreover, LV vectors may express additional immunostimulatory and immunoregulatory proteins that enhance DC function and direct antigen-specific T cells responses. Recent basic and clinical research efforts have broadened our understanding of LV vectors as DC-based vaccines. In this review, we provide an overview of the pre-clinical and clinical LV vector vaccine studies for treating HIV to date. We also discuss advances in LV vector designs that have enhanced DC transduction efficiency, target cell specificity, and immunogenicity, and address potential safety concerns regarding LV vector-based vaccines.",eng,Frontiers in immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In this context, multiscale MD simulations have been applied to investigate the preferred orientation of transmembrane domain of NS2 protein (TNS2) in a POPC bilayer, structural stability and characteristic of intramembrane protein-lipid and protein-protein interaction. Our study indicates that NS2 protein adopts three trans-membrane segments with highly stable α-helix structure in a POPC bilayer and a short helical luminal segment. While the first and second TM segment involved in continuous helical domain, the third TM segment is however cleaved into two sub-segments with different tilt angles via a kink at L87G88. Salt bridges K81-E45, R32-PO4 and R43-PO4 are determined as the key factor to stabilize the structure of TM2 and TM3 which consist of charged residues located in the hydrophobic region of the membrane.",eng,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Clinical benefit in a real-world study.,"Rhenium-188-HEDP ((188)Re-HEDP) is an effective radiopharmaceutical for the palliative treatment of osteoblastic bone metastases. However, only limited data on its routine use are available and its effect on quality of life (QoL) has not been studied. Therefore, we evaluated the clinical benefit of (188)Re-HEDP in routine clinical care.--NEW SECTION--Prostate or breast cancer patients with painful bone metastases receiving (188)Re-HEDP as a routine clinical procedure were eligible for evaluation. Clinical benefit was assessed in terms of efficacy and toxicity. Pain palliation and QoL were monitored using the visual analogue scale (VAS), corrected for opioid intake, and the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global health status/QoL-scale. Thrombocyte and leukocyte nadirs were used to assess haematological toxicity.--NEW SECTION--45 and 47 patients were evaluable for pain palliation and QoL, respectively. After a single injection of (188)Re-HEDP, the overall pain response rate was 69% and mean VAS-scores decreased relevantly and significantly (p < 0.05). Repeated treatment resulted in similar pain response. The overall QoL response rate was 68% and mean Global health status/QoL-scores increased relevantly and significantly. Haematological side effects were mild and transient.--NEW SECTION--The clinically relevant response on pain and quality of life and the limited adverse events prove clinical benefit of treatment with (188)Re-HEDP and support its use in routine clinical care.

The problem consists in how policy is made, how leaders are accountable, how the World Health Organization (WHO) and foreign donors encourage (or distort) health policy, and how development objectives are prioritized in these countries.--NEW SECTION--This paper uses political economy analysis, which stems from a recognition that the solution to the shortage of health workers across Africa involves more than a technical response. A number of institutional arrangements dampen investments in HRH, including a mismatch between officials' tenure in office and program results, the vertical nature of health programming, the modalities of Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) in health, the structures of the global health community, and the weak capacity in HRH units within Ministries of Health. A major change in policymaking would only occur with a disruption to the political or institutional order.--NEW SECTION--The case study of Ethiopia, who has increased its health workforce dramatically over the last 20 years, disrupted previous institutional arrangements through the power of ideas-HRH as a key intermediate development objective. The framing of HRH created the rationale for the political commitment to HRH investment. Ethiopia demonstrates that political will coupled with strong state capacity and adequate resource mobilization can overcome the institutional hurdles above.

Scaling up delivery of proven, effective interventions for hypertension could significantly advance the goal of reducing the global burden. Although significant progress has been made in many countries, some lament that large-scale initiatives focused on reducing blood pressure in global populations have not effectively addressed this challenge. Late-stage implementation research plays a critical role in determining effective and sustainable scale-up of these initiatives. In this article, we briefly discuss some of the global initiatives that have been funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the US National Institutes of Health. Intervention delivery strategies in low resource settings must have demonstrated effectiveness and consideration for the social, cultural and physical context (eg, access, affordability, and availability of medications) in which a program is being delivered in order to be sustainable nationally and globally. Hence, the use of implementation research is central to determining sustainable delivery of evidence-based and tailored interventions focused on hypertension control. The sustained control of hypertension in global populations holds tremendous potential for reducing morbidity, premature mortality, and the adverse economic impact of cardiovascular disease in all regions.",eng,Ethnicity & disease,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27440841,10.2337/dcS15-3016,Pharmacological Approaches in the Treatment and Maintenance of Weight Loss.,"Obesity is a growing global health concern, associated with a number of important comorbid conditions. It increases the risk of diabetes and contributes to development of cardiovascular disease. While the benefits of weight loss are well established, weight reduction remains a difficult-to-reach goal in overweight and obese individuals due to several metabolic and psychological factors. For many patients, lifestyle intervention is insufficient to achieve long-term weight loss, and additional options, such as pharmacotherapy, need to be considered. Besides the challenging enterprise of weight reduction, weight maintenance remains an even more crucial and outcome-determining aspect of weight management. This article focuses on the potential of currently available pharmacological strategies to support weight loss and maintenance goals in individuals at risk. Two pharmacotherapy types are considered: those developed primarily to induce weight loss and those developed primarily for blood glucose control that have a favorable effect on body weight. Finally, the potential of very low- and low-calorie diets combined with pharmacotherapy and pharmacological combination therapies are discussed, as well as emerging approaches in development.",eng,Diabetes care,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27439621,10.1186/s12916-016-0653-z,"The potential to expand antiretroviral therapy by improving health facility efficiency: evidence from Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia.","Since 2000, international funding for HIV has supported scaling up antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. However, such funding has stagnated for years, threatening the sustainability and reach of ART programs amid efforts to achieve universal treatment. Improving health system efficiencies, particularly at the facility level, is an increasingly critical avenue for extending limited resources for ART; nevertheless, the potential impact of increased facility efficiency on ART capacity remains largely unknown. Through the present study, we sought to quantify facility-level technical efficiency across countries, assess potential determinants of efficiency, and predict the potential for additional ART expansion.--NEW SECTION--Using nationally-representative facility datasets from Kenya, Uganda and Zambia, and measures adjusting for structural quality, we estimated facility-level technical efficiency using an ensemble approach that combined restricted versions of Data Envelopment Analysis and Stochastic Distance Function. We then conducted a series of bivariate and multivariate regression analyses to evaluate possible determinants of higher or lower technical efficiency. Finally, we predicted the potential for ART expansion across efficiency improvement scenarios, estimating how many additional ART visits could be accommodated if facilities with low efficiency thresholds reached those levels of efficiency.--NEW SECTION--In each country, national averages of efficiency fell below 50 % and facility-level efficiency markedly varied. Among facilities providing ART, average efficiency scores spanned from 50 % (95 % uncertainty interval (UI), 48-62 %) in Uganda to 59 % (95 % UI, 53-67 %) in Zambia. Of the facility determinants analyzed, few were consistently associated with higher or lower technical efficiency scores, suggesting that other factors may be more strongly related to facility-level efficiency. Based on observed facility resources and an efficiency improvement scenario where all facilities providing ART reached 80 % efficiency, we predicted a 33 % potential increase in ART visits in Kenya, 62 % in Uganda, and 33 % in Zambia. Given observed resources in facilities offering ART, we estimated that 459,000 new ART patients could be seen if facilities in these countries reached 80 % efficiency, equating to a 40 % increase in new patients.--NEW SECTION--Health facilities in Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia could notably expand ART services if the efficiency with which they operate increased. Improving how facility resources are used, and not simply increasing their quantity, has the potential to substantially elevate the impact of global health investments and reduce treatment gaps for people living with HIV.",eng,BMC medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Agreeing priority areas is therefore critical. This paper describes an 18-month process to develop a consultative research agenda and questions for health systems research, providing reflections on the process as well as its output.--NEW SECTION--After a scoping review had been conducted, primary data was collected from August 2014 to September 2015. Data was collected using a mixture of methods, including an online survey (n = 61), two face-to-face group sessions (one with 11 participants; one with 17), email consultation (n = 18), a webinar (n = 65), and feedback via LinkedIn. Two steering committees of purposively selected experts guided the research process - a core steering committee (n = 10) and broad steering committee (n = 20). The process moved from developing broad topics and lists of research needs to grouping and honing them down into a smaller, prioritised agenda, with specific research questions associated to each topic.--NEW SECTION--An initial list of 146 topics was honed down to 25 research needs through this process, grouped thematically under transition and sustainability, resilience and fragility, gender and equity, accessibility, capacity building, actors and accountability, community, healthcare delivery, health workforce, and health financing. They were not ranked, as all health system areas are interdependent. The research agenda forms a starting point for local contextualisation and is not definitive.--NEW SECTION--A wide range of stakeholders participated in the different stages of this exercise, which produced a useful starting point for health systems research agenda setting in fragile and conflict-affected states. The process of engagement may have been as valuable for building a community of researchers as the product. It is now important to drive forward the research agenda. Without both a higher profile and deeper focus for this area, there is a real risk that fragile and conflict-affected states will continue to fall behind in global health and development goals.",eng,Health research policy and systems,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Significant focus has been placed on understanding the structural determinants of HIV and designing related interventions. Although there is growing international evidence that policing is an important structural HIV determinant among sex workers, the evidence has not been systematically reviewed.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a systematic review of quantitative studies to examine the effects of policing on HIV and STI infection and HIV-related outcomes (condom use; syringe use; number of clients; HIV/STI testing and access) among cis and trans women sex workers. Databases included PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Sociological Abstracts, Popline, Global Health (OVID), Web of Science, IBSS, IndMed and WHOLIS. We searched for studies that included police practices as an exposure for HIV or STI infection or HIV-related outcomes.--NEW SECTION--Of the 137 peer-reviewed articles identified for full text review, 14 were included, representing sex workers' experiences with police across five settings. Arrest was the most commonly explored measure with between 6 and 45% of sex workers reporting having ever been arrested. Sexual coercion was observed between 3 and 37% of the time and police extortion between 12 and 28% across studies. Half the studies used a single measure to capture police behaviours. Studies predominantly focused on ""extra-legal policing practices,"" with insufficient attention to the role of ""legal enforcement activities"". All studies found an association between police behaviours and HIV or STI infection, or a related risk behaviour.--NEW SECTION--The review points to a small body of evidence that confirms policing practices as an important structural HIV determinant for sex workers, but studies lack generalizability with respect to identifying those police behaviours most relevant to women's HIV risk environment.",eng,Journal of the International AIDS Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Cellulitis is a common global health burden, with more than 650,000 admissions per year in the United States alone.--NEW SECTION--In the United States, an estimated 14.5 million cases annually of cellulitis account for $3.7 billion in ambulatory care costs alone. The majority of cases of cellulitis are nonculturable and therefore the causative bacteria are unknown. In the 15% of cellulitis cases in which organisms are identified, most are due to β-hemolytic Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. There are no effective diagnostic modalities, and many clinical conditions appear similar. Treatment of primary and recurrent cellulitis should initially cover Streptococcus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, with expansion for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in cases of cellulitis associated with specific risk factors, such as athletes, children, men who have sex with men, prisoners, military recruits, residents of long-term care facilities, those with prior MRSA exposure, and intravenous drug users. Five days of treatment is sufficient with extension if symptoms are not improved. Addressing predisposing factors can minimize risk of recurrence.--NEW SECTION--The diagnosis of cellulitis is based primarily on history and physical examination. Treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis should be directed against Streptococcus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Failure to improve with appropriate first-line antibiotics should prompt consideration for resistant organisms, secondary conditions that mimic cellulitis, or underlying complicating conditions such as immunosuppression, chronic liver disease, or chronic kidney disease.",eng,JAMA,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Trans women experience a heavy burden of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), high incidence of violence and difficulties accessing gender-affirming services. At the same time, little has been published on trans men's health, HIV issues, needs and experiences. Young trans people are especially marginalized and vulnerable, with few programmes and services specifically tailored to their needs. Trans-specific data and guidance are needed to adapt the global response to HIV to meet the needs of the trans population. While the needs of this group have only recently received attention, global, regional and other technical guidance documents are being developed to address these gaps. Regional blueprints for comprehensive care for trans people in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia and the Pacific are now available. These tools - supported by the Pan American Health Organization, World Health Organization, US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the United Nations Development Programme, in collaboration with regional trans groups - provide a contextual map, indicating opportunities for interventions in health, HIV, violence, stigma and discrimination, social protection and human rights. Global guidance includes the World Health Organization's Policy Brief: Transgender People and HIV, and the interagency publication, Implementing Comprehensive HIV and STI Programmes with Transgender People. Community empowerment and capacity building are the focus of the new tools for global and regional transgender guidance. The goal is to strengthen and ensure community-led responses to the HIV challenge in trans populations.

In this paper we propose that WHO has the authority and credibility to support capacity-building in the area of health law within Member States, and to make national laws easier to access, understand, monitor and evaluate. We believe a strong case can be made to donors for the funding of a public health law centre or unit, that has adequate staffing, is robustly networked with its regional counterparts and is integrated into the main work of WHO. The mission of the unit or centre would be to define and integrate scientific and legal expertise in public health law, both technical and programmatic, across the work of WHO, and to conduct and facilitate global health policy surveillance.",eng,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Available data for all road users and by road user group were extracted and analysed. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis and estimated pooled rates of road traffic injuries and deaths.--NEW SECTION--We identified 39 studies from 15 African countries. The estimated pooled rate for road traffic injury was 65.2 per 100 000 population (95% confidence interval, CI: 60.8-69.5) and the death rate was 16.6 per 100 000 population (95% CI: 15.2-18.0). Road traffic injury rates increased from 40.7 per 100 000 population in the 1990s to 92.9 per 100 000 population between 2010 and 2015, while death rates decreased from 19.9 per 100 000 population in the 1990s to 9.3 per 100 000 population between 2010 and 2015. The highest road traffic death rate was among motorized four-wheeler occupants at 5.9 per 100 000 population (95% CI: 4.4-7.4), closely followed by pedestrians at 3.4 per 100 000 population (95% CI: 2.5-4.2).--NEW SECTION--The burden of road traffic injury and death is high in Africa.

Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance is the epicenter of the development agenda for novel diagnostic and therapeutic (drugs/vaccines) targets for malaria. In this study, we report global comparative transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq) to characterize the difference in the transcriptome between 48-h intraerythrocytic stage of chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum (3D7 and Dd2) strains. The two P. falciparum 3D7 and Dd2 strains have distant geographical origin, the Netherlands and Indochina, respectively. The strains were cultured by an in vitro method and harvested at the 48-h intraerythrocytic stage having 5% parasitemia. The whole transcriptome sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with paired-end reads. The reads were aligned with the reference P. falciparum genome. The alignment percentages for 3D7, Dd2, and Dd2 w/CQ strains were 85.40%, 89.13%, and 84%, respectively. Nearly 40% of the transcripts had known gene function, whereas the remaining genes (about 60%) had unknown function. The genes involved in immune evasion showed a significant difference between the strains. The differential gene expression between the sensitive and resistant strains was measured using the cuffdiff program with the p-value cutoff ≤0.05. Collectively, this study identified differentially expressed genes between 3D7 and Dd2 strains, where we found 89 genes to be upregulated and 227 to be downregulated. On the contrary, for 3D7 and Dd2 w/CQ strains, 45 genes were upregulated and 409 were downregulated. These differentially regulated genes code, by and large, for surface antigens involved in invasion, pathogenesis, and host-parasite interactions, among others. The exhibition of transcriptional differences between these strains of P. falciparum contributes to our understanding of the attendant, drug-sensitivity phenotypes, and by extension, the current efforts in maintaining global health by developing novel diagnostics and therapeutics for malaria.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

An increasing body of experience suggests that electrochemotherapy (ECT) provides effective tumor control, although its evidence basis should be strengthened.--NEW SECTION--This prospective, multicenter, observational study enrolled patients with superficial metastases, who underwent ECT at 10 centers between 2008 and 2013. Outcomes included adherence to European Standard Operating Procedures of ECT (ESOPE), tumor response, local progression-free survival (LPFS), toxicity and patient-reported outcomes (PROs, EORTC QLQ-C30 plus an 8-item questionnaire).--NEW SECTION--We enrolled 376 eligible patients. Tumor histotype distribution was as follows: melanoma, 56%; squamous cell carcinoma, 11%; Kaposi sarcoma, 11%; breast carcinoma, 8%; basal cell carcinoma, 6%; soft tissue sarcomas, 3%; others, 5%. We registered 1304 target tumors (median size 1 cm). Treatment adhered to ESOPE in 88% of patients as to the route of drug administration, and in 70% as to electrode application. The procedure was mainly performed under sedation (64.6%) and by using intravenous chemotherapy (93.4%). Tumor response rate at 60 days was 88% (complete, 50%).

27424132,NA,Reduced Phagocytic Capacity of Blood Monocyte/Macrophages in Tuberculosis Patients Is Further Reduced by Smoking.,"Tuberculosis (TB) and tobacco use are two major alarming global health issues posing immense threats to human populations. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) by activation of macrophages could induce the sequences of cells activation and releases of inflammatory cytokines such as CXCL-8, Il-12 and TNF-α which in turn induces the immune system network. However no information is available on other activity of cells by MTB and smoking. In the current study we aimed to investigate the serum levels TNF-a, CXCL-8 and phagocytosis capacity in tuberculosis patients with and without smoking. 103 subjects entered the study including 61 new diagnosed pulmonary TB patients (23 smokers and 38 nonsmokers) and 42 control healthy subjects. The phagocytosis of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-dextran) in blood monocytes/macrophages through flowcytometry was assessed. Serum levels of TNF-a and CXCL-8 were analyzed by ELISA methods. A lower percentage of cells from TB patients who smoked [50.29% (43.4-57.2), p<0.01] took up FITC-dextran after 2h compared to non-smoking TB subjects [71.62% (69.2-74.1)] and healthy cases [97.45% (95.9-99.1). Phagocytic capacity was inversely correlated with cigarette smoking as measured by pack years (r=-0.73, p<0.001). The serum levels of TNF-a and CXCL-8 were significantly higher in the TB patients who smoked compared to the TB non-smoker group (p<0.001, p<0.01 respectively). Blood monocytes/macrophages from TB patients have reduced phagocytic capacity which is further reduced in TB patients who smoke. Smoking enhanced serum levels of TNF-a and CXCL-8 suggesting a greater imbalance between the proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors in these patients.",eng,"Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Therefore to slow down the progression of this condition is a main objective in nephrology. It has been extensively reported that microinflammation, immune system deregulation, and oxidative stress contribute to CKD progression. Additionally, dialysis worsens this clinical condition because of the contact of blood with bioincompatible dialytic devices. Numerous studies have shown the close link between immune system impairment and CKD but most have been performed using classical biomolecular strategies. These methodologies are limited in their ability to discover new elements and enable measuring the simultaneous influence of multiple factors. The ""omics"" techniques could overcome these gaps. For example, transcriptomics has revealed that mitochondria and inflammasome have a role in pathogenesis of CKD and are pivotal elements in the cellular alterations leading to systemic complications. We believe that a larger employment of this technique, together with other ""omics"" methodologies, could help clinicians to obtain new pathogenetic insights, novel diagnostic biomarkers, and therapeutic targets. Finally, transcriptomics could allow clinicians to personalize therapeutic strategies according to individual genetic background (nutrigenomic and pharmacogenomic).

Three well characterised toxins are encoded by this bacterium in two genetic loci, specifically, TcdB (toxin B) and TcdA (toxin A) in the Pathogenicity Locus (PaLoc) and binary toxin (CDT) in the genomically distinct CDT locus (CdtLoc). Toxin production is controlled by regulators specific to each locus. The orphan response regulator, CdtR, encoded within the CdtLoc, up-regulates CDT production. Until now there has been no suggestion that CdtR influences TcdA and TcdB production since it is not carried by all PaLoc-containing strains and CdtLoc is not linked genetically to PaLoc. Here we show that, in addition to CDT, CdtR regulates TcdA and TcdB production but that this effect is strain dependent. Of clinical relevance, CdtR increased the production of TcdA, TcdB and CDT in two epidemic ribotype 027 human strains, modulating their virulence in a mouse infection model. Strains traditionally from animal lineages, notably ribotype 078 strains, are increasingly being isolated from humans and their genetic and phenotypic analysis is critical for future studies on this important pathogen. Here we show that CdtR-mediated toxin regulation did not occur in other strain backgrounds, including a ribotype 078 animal strain. The finding that toxin gene regulation is strain dependent highlights the regulatory diversity between C. difficile isolates and the importance of studying virulence regulation in diverse lineages and clinically relevant strains. Our work provides the first evidence that TcdA, TcdB and CDT production is linked by a common regulatory mechanism and that CdtR may act as a global regulator of virulence in epidemic 027 strains.",eng,PLoS pathogens,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27411329,NA,Membrane-active Antimicrobial Peptides as Template Structures for Novel Antibiotic Agents.,"The increase of pathogens being resistant to antibiotics represents a global health problem and thus, there is an urgent need for the development of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action. Host defense peptides, which have direct antimicrobial activity (also termed antimicrobial peptides) or immune modulating activity, are valuable template structures for the development of such compounds. Antimicrobial peptides exhibit remarkably different structures as well as biological activity profiles with multiple targets. A large fraction of these peptides interfere physically with the cell membrane of bacteria (focus of this review), but can also translocate into the cytosol, where they interact with nucleic acids, ribosomes and proteins. Several potential interaction sites have to be considered on the route of the peptides from the environment to the cytoplasmic membrane. Translocation of peptides through the cell wall may not be impaired by the thick but relatively porous peptidoglycan layer. However, interaction with lipopolysaccharides of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and (lipo)teichoic acids of Gram-positive bacteria may reduce the effective concentration at the cytoplasmic membrane, where supposedly the killing event takes place. On a molecular level several mechanisms are discussed, which are important for the rational design of improved antimicrobial compounds: toroidal pore formation, carpet model (coverage of membrane surface by peptides), interfacial activity, void formation, clustering of lipids and effects of membrane curvature. In summary, many of these models just represent special cases that can be interrelated to each other and depend on the nature of lipids and peptides.",eng,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Exercise capacity (6-min walk distance [6MWD] and constant work rate at 80% of peak work rate), symptoms (Mahler's index), and health status (St George Respiratory Questionnaire) were compared before and after PR programs for each COPD category. Changes were analyzed using generalized estimating equations and logistic regression models.--NEW SECTION--One hundred sixty-seven subjects were included (COPD categories A [16%], B [12%], C [31%], and D [41%]). Groups were homogeneous in age, body mass index, smoking pack-years, and comorbidities. Significant improvements in all outcomes were found after adjusting for COPD categories, age, sex, body mass index, and COPD-specific comorbidity index. All COPD categories improved exercise capacity (6MWD and constant work rate). Categories A and C had more pronounced improvements in 6MWD than categories B and D. Symptoms (Mahler's index) also improved significantly in categories A and C, whereas change was not significant in categories B and D. Global health status (St George Respiratory Questionnaire) improved significantly in all COPD categories. Despite these differences, the odds of achieving a minimum clinically important difference in each outcome were similar and without statistical significance for the A, B, and C categories when compared with D.--NEW SECTION--This study demonstrates that patients in all COPD categories may improve exercise capacity, symptoms, and health status with PR programs, and COPD categories alone may not be sufficient to discriminate which patients may benefit most from them.",eng,Respiratory care,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2016

However, pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease is a rare condition with unknown clinical features. The present study aimed to clarify the clinical features of pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease described in recent cases and reports.--NEW SECTION--We reviewed the medical records of all adult patients with pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease at Keio University Hospital and the National Center for Global Health and Medicine Center Hospital between 2001 and 2011. We also conducted a review of the PubMed database to identify additional cases of pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease in adults.--NEW SECTION--Our study identified 8 cases of pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease at the 2 identified institutions during our study period. Most cases were diagnosed in middle-aged and elderly men with underlying pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease, as well as those with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. In contrast, most previously reported cases identified through our literature review had a history of dust inhalation or underlying silicosis. Three of 8 cases at our institutions and 20 of 23 cases from the literature were treated with combination therapies.--NEW SECTION--We conclude that in the recent histories of our institutions, pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease has mainly occurred in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases.

Zika virus has spread to numerous countries throughout the Americas, affecting up to an estimated 1.3 million people since the first reports from Brazil in early 2015. Although ZIKV infections are self-limiting, fetal microcephaly and ophthalmic anomalies have been associated with ZIKV infection as a possible result of perinatal transmission. The causal link between maternal ZIKV infection and newborn microcephaly and eye lesions has not been proven beyond doubt and is currently debated. We discuss the possibility of causality by ZIKV using Koch's postulates and the more appropriate Bradford Hill criteria.

We performed a content analysis of these films (n=82 Argentine, 91 Mexican, and 908 US films, respectively). Chi-squares and t-tests were used to compare characteristics of characters who smoked or drank by country of movie production. Then data from all countries were pooled, and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to determine independent correlates of character smoking or drinking. There were 480 major characters for Argentine-, 364 for Mexican-, and 4962 for US-produced films. Smoking prevalence among movie characters was similar to population smoking prevalence in Mexico (21%) and Argentina (26%), but about half in the US (11%), where movie product placements are restricted. Movie smoking declined over the period in all three countries. Movie alcohol prevalence was 40-50% across all countries and did not change with time. Demographic predictors of character smoking included: being male, 18 and older, having negative character valence. Movie smoking was not associated with lower SES. Predictors of character drinking included: being age 18 and older and positive character valence. Smoking and drinking predicted each other, illicit drug use, and higher scores for other risk behaviors. This suggests that policy development in Mexico and Argentina may be necessary to reduce the amount of character tobacco and alcohol use in films.",eng,Preventive medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

So far, no CHIKV specific drug or vaccine is licensed for human use. In this study, we report production of Chikungunya virus like particles (CHIK-VLPs) using novel yeast expression system (Pichia pastoris) and its evaluation as vaccine candidate. The gene encoding structural polyprotein of CHIKV from a recent epidemic strain was cloned into yeast expression system. The multicopy integrants were processed for expression of CHIK-VLPs. The VLPs were purified and confirmed through electron microscopic analysis for their morphological identity with CHIKV. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation of CHIK-VLPs as vaccine candidate was determined in Balb/c mice. Induction of both humoral and cellular immune response was observed with different doses of CHIK-VLPs. The humoral immune response was studied through different techniques like enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, IgG Isotyping and plaque reduction neutralization test. CHIK-VLPs were found to elicit high titer of antibodies that are able to recognize native CHIKV. Higher level of IgG2a and IgG1 subtypes was identified suggestive of balanced Th1/Th2 response. Both in vitro and in vivo neutralization activity of CHIK-VLPs antibodies was observed even with low concentration, which shows its high specificity and neutralizing activity against two different CHIKV strains. Neonatal mice receiving anti-CHIK-VLPs antibodies were protected from CHIKV challenge. Induction of cellular immune response was confirmed through higher level of TNF-α, IL-10 and substantial level of IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-γ indicating a balanced response. This is the first report, where CHIK-VLPs has been expressed by Pichia pastoris and evaluated for neutralizing activity against CHIKV.

Bacterial identification and enumeration in water samples is significant as it helps to maintain safe drinking water for public consumption. Culture-based methods are laborious, time-consuming, and yield false-positive results, whereas viable but nonculturable (VBNCs) microorganisms cannot be recovered. Hence, numerous methods have been developed for rapid detection and quantification of waterborne pathogenic bacteria in water. These rapid methods can be classified into nucleic acid-based, immunology-based, and biosensor-based detection methods. This review summarizes the principle and current state of rapid methods for the monitoring and detection of waterborne bacterial pathogens. Rapid methods outlined are polymerase chain reaction (PCR), digital droplet PCR, real-time PCR, multiplex PCR, DNA microarray, Next-generation sequencing (pyrosequencing, Illumina technology and genomics), and fluorescence in situ hybridization that are categorized as nucleic acid-based methods. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence are classified into immunology-based methods.

We designed the PORTEC-3 trial to investigate the benefit of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone for women with high-risk endometrial cancer.--NEW SECTION--PORTEC-3 was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, international trial. Women with high-risk endometrial cancer were randomly allocated (1:1) to radiotherapy alone (48·6 Gy) in 1·8 Gy fractions five times a week or chemoradiotherapy (two cycles concurrent cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) and four adjuvant cycles of carboplatin area under the curve [AUC] 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2)) using a biased coin minimisation procedure with stratification for participating centre, lymphadenectomy, stage of cancer, and histological type. The primary endpoints of the PORTEC-3 trial were overall survival and failure-free survival analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This analysis focuses on 2-year toxicity and health-related quality of life as secondary endpoints; analysis was done according to treatment received. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) the cervix cancer module and chemotherapy and neuropathy subscales of the ovarian cancer module at baseline, after radiotherapy and at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months after randomisation. Adverse events were graded with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.

This trial is registered with ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN14387080, and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00411138.--NEW SECTION--Between Sept 15, 2006, and Dec 20, 2013, 686 women were randomly allocated in the PORTEC-3 trial. Of these, 660 met eligibility criteria, and 570 (86%) were evaluable for health-related quality of life. Median follow-up was 42·3 months (IQR 25·8-55·1). At completion of radiotherapy and at 6 months, EORTC QLQ-C30 functioning scales were significantly lower (worse functioning) and health-related quality of life symptom scores higher (worse symptoms) for the chemoradiotherapy group compared with radiotherapy alone, improving with time. At 12 and 24 months, global health or quality of life was similar between groups, whereas physical functioning scores remained slightly lower in patients who received chemoradiotherapy compared with patients who received radiotherapy alone. At 24 months, 48 (25%) of 194 patients in the chemoradiotherapy group reported severe tingling or numbness compared with 11 (6%) of 170 patients in the radiotherapy alone group (p<0·0001). Grade 2 or worse adverse events were found during treatment in 309 (94%) of 327 patients in the chemoradiotherapy group versus 145 (44%) of 326 patients in the radiotherapy alone group, and grade 3 or worse events were found in 198 (61%) of 327 patients in the chemoradiotherapy group versus 42 (13%) of 326 patients in the radiotherapy alone group (p<0·0001), with most of the grade 3 adverse events being haematological (45%).

Stress is a key precipitant of relapse in human alcoholics and in animal models of alcohol seeking. The brainstem nucleus incertus (NI) contains a population of relaxin-3 neurons that are highly responsive to psychological stressors; and the ascending NI relaxin-3/RXFP3 signalling system is implicated in stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. The NI receives orexinergic innervation and expresses orexin1 (OX1) and orexin2 (OX2) receptor mRNA. In alcohol-preferring (iP) rats, we examined the impact of yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking on orexin neuronal activation, and the effect of bilateral injections into NI of the OX1 receptor antagonist, SB-334867 (n = 16) or the OX2 receptor antagonist, TCS-OX2-29 (n = 8) on stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. We also assessed the effects of orexin-A on NI neuronal activity and the involvement of OX1 and OX2 receptors using whole cell patch-clamp recordings in rat brain slices. Yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking activated orexin neurons. Bilateral NI injections of TCS-OX2-29 attenuated yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. In contrast, intra-NI injection of SB-334867 had no significant effect. In line with these data, orexin-A (600 nM) depolarized a majority of NI neurons recorded in coronal brain slices (18/28 cells), effects prevented by bath application of TCS-OX2-29 (10 μM), but not SB-334867 (10 μM).

While economic evaluation provides a way of approaching the prioritisation of vertical projects, it provides less guidance on how to prioritise between horizontal and vertical spending. We approach this problem by formulating a mathematical program which captures the complementary benefits of funding both vertical projects and horizontal programmes. We show that our solution to this math program has an appealing intuitive structure. We illustrate our model by computationally solving two specialised versions of this problem, with illustrations based on the problem of allocating funding for infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa.

ZIKV infections remain asymptomatic in approximately 80% of the individuals, and no anti-viral treatments were recommended. Yet, neurological complications associated with the infections, such as infant microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome are major cause of the concern. Although, based on small numbers of cases, existing evidence strongly supports an exclusive link of viral infection and observed neurological complications. However, much work remains to assign exact numbers of complications caused by ZIKV. Regarding its structural attributes ZIKV shows remarkable resemblance with dengue virus and West-Nile virus.

Methamphetamine abuse is a global health epidemic with no proven treatment. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of intermittent nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on operant methamphetamine intake and on methamphetamine seeking when stimulation is delivered in an environment different from that of drug use. METHODS Eighteen rats were implanted with intravenous (IV) catheters and bilateral AcbSh electrodes and subsequently underwent daily sessions in 2-lever (active/methamphetamine and inactive/no reward) operant chambers to establish IV methamphetamine self-administration. After stable responding was achieved, 3 hours of DBS or sham treatment was administered (sham: 0 µA, n = 8; active: 200 µA, n = 10) in a separate nondrug environment prior to the daily operant sessions for 5 consecutive days. Immediately following each DBS/sham treatment, rats were placed in the operant chambers to examine the effects of remote stimulation on methamphetamine intake. After the 5 days of therapy were finished, rats reestablished a posttreatment baseline, followed by extinction training, abstinence, and 1 day of relapse testing to assess methamphetamine-seeking behavior. RESULTS There was a decrease in total methamphetamine intake in rats receiving active DBS versus sham on Days 1 (42%) and 2 (44%). Methamphetamine administration returned to baseline levels following the cessation of DBS therapy. Compared with baseline drug responding, methamphetamine seeking was reduced (57%) in the DBS group but not in the sham group. CONCLUSIONS It is feasible to deliver noncontinuous DBS outside of the drug use environment with a resultant decrease in IV methamphetamine intake and seeking. The AcbSh is a neuroanatomical substrate for psychostimulant reinforcement and may be a target for intermittent neuromodulatory therapies that could be administered during brief periods of sobriety.",eng,Journal of neurosurgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Management of this deadly co-infection is a significant global health challenge that is exacerbated by the lack of efficient vaccines against both Mtb and HIV, as well as the lack of reliable and robust animal models for Mtb/HIV co-infection. Here we describe a tractable and reproducible mouse model to study the reactivation dynamics of latent Mtb infection following the loss of CD4+ T cells as it occurs in HIV-co-infected individuals. Whereas intradermally (i.d.) infected C57BL/6 mice contained Mtb within the local draining lymph nodes, depletion of CD4+ cells led to progressive systemic spread of the bacteria and induction of lung pathology. To interrogate whether reactivation of Mtb after CD4+ T cell depletion can be reversed, we employed interleukin (IL)-2/anti-IL-2 complex-mediated cell boost approaches. Although populations of non-CD4 lymphocytes, such as CD8+ memory T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and double-negative (DN) T cells significantly expanded after IL-2/anti-IL-2 complex treatment, progressive development of bacteremia and pathologic lung alterations could not be prevented. These data suggest that the failure to reverse Mtb reactivation is likely not due to anergy of the expanded cell subsets and rather indicates a limited potential for IL-2-complex-based therapies in the management of Mtb/HIV co-infection.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Overweight was chosen as 'outcome' variable of interest and binary multi-logistic regression analysis was used to identify determinants.--NEW SECTION--The prevalence rates of tobacco use, alcohol use, inadequate physical activity and inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables were 32%, 49%, 24% and 92% respectively among hotel employees. Tobacco use was significantly common among those in food preparation and service, alcohol use among those in food service and security and leisure time physical activity among front office workers. More than two-fifths (42.7%) were overweight. Among the hotel workers, those employed in food preparation and security had higher odds of 1.650 (CI: 1.025 - 2.655) and 3.245 (CI: 1.296 - 8.129) respectively of being overweight.--NEW SECTION--Prevalence of chronic disease risk factors is high among hotel workers. Risk of overweight is significantly high in food preparation and security departments and workplace interventions are necessary to address these risks.",eng,Indian journal of occupational and environmental medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27389781,10.15585/mmwr.su6503a7,Laboratory Response to Ebola - West Africa and United States.,"The 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease (Ebola) epidemic in West Africa highlighted the need to maintain organized laboratory systems or networks that can be effectively reorganized to implement new diagnostic strategies and laboratory services in response to large-scale events. Although previous Ebola outbreaks enabled establishment of critical laboratory practice safeguards and diagnostic procedures, this Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the need for planning and preparedness activities that are better adapted to emerging pathogens or to pathogens that have attracted little commercial interest. The crisis underscored the need for better mechanisms to streamline development and evaluation of new diagnostic assays, transfer of material and specimens between countries and organizations, and improved processes for rapidly deploying health workers with specific laboratory expertise. The challenges and events of the outbreak forced laboratorians to examine not only the comprehensive capacities of existing national laboratory systems to recognize and respond to events, but also their sustainability over time and the mechanisms that need to be pre-established to ensure effective response. Critical to this assessment was the recognition of how response activities (i.e., infrastructure support, logistics, and workforce supplementation) can be used or repurposed to support the strengthening of national laboratory systems during the postevent transition to capacity building and recovery. This report compares CDC's domestic and international laboratory response engagements and lessons learned that can improve future responses in support of the International Health Regulations and Global Health Security Agenda initiatives.The activities summarized in this report would not have been possible without collaboration with many U.S. and international partners (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/partners.html).",eng,MMWR supplements,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Surveillance for Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in the West African countries heavily affected by Ebola (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) faced numerous impediments, including insufficient numbers of trained staff, community reticence to report cases and contacts, limited information technology resources, limited telephone and Internet service, and overwhelming numbers of infected persons. Through the work of CDC and numerous partners, including the countries' ministries of health, the World Health Organization, and other government and nongovernment organizations, functional Ebola surveillance was established and maintained in these countries. CDC staff were heavily involved in implementing case-based surveillance systems, sustaining case surveillance and contact tracing, and interpreting surveillance data. In addition to helping the ministries of health and other partners understand and manage the epidemic, CDC's activities strengthened epidemiologic and data management capacity to improve routine surveillance in the countries affected, even after the Ebola epidemic ended, and enhanced local capacity to respond quickly to future public health emergencies. However, the many obstacles overcome during development of these Ebola surveillance systems highlight the need to have strong public health, surveillance, and information technology infrastructure in place before a public health emergency occurs. Intense, long-term focus on strengthening public health surveillance systems in developing countries, as described in the Global Health Security Agenda, is needed.The activities summarized in this report would not have been possible without collaboration with many U.S and international partners (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/partners.html).",eng,MMWR supplements,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In contrast, the process of reverse pathogen transmission (zooanthroponosis), whereby pathogens move from humans into wildlife species is still largely unexplored. Globally, increasing urbanisation and habitat loss are driving many wildlife species into urban and regional centres. In Australia, large numbers of flying foxes now live in close proximity to humans, increasing the risk of zooanthroponosis. The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium is an emerging zoonotic parasite that infects a wide range of vertebrates yet there are limited studies on transmission potential of Cryptosporidium between humans and urban wildlife. To explore the presence of zooanthroponosis in flying foxes in Australia the occurrence and diversity of Cryptosporidium was investigated in urbanised wild and captive flying foxes. PCR screening of faecal samples (n=281) from seven wild sites and two captive facilities identified the presence of Cryptosporidium in 3.2% (95% CI 1.5% to 6.0%) of faecal samples. In faecal samples from wild sites Cryptosporidium occurrence was 1.7% (95% CI 0.3% to 4.8%) versus 5.9% (95% CI 2.2% to 12.4%) in samples from captive individuals, with no significant difference between captive and wild sites (p=0.077). Multilocus sequencing using three loci, 18s rDNA, actin and gp60 was used to identify Cryptosporidium in flying fox species. The host specific Cryptosporidium hominis was identified in faecal samples from two captive flying foxes, and one of these samples was confirmed as C. hominis at both actin and gp60. Sequencing of the 18s rDNA also revealed four novel Cryptosporidium genotypes in wild and captive individuals, actin and gp60 amplification and sequencing were unreliable for all four novel genotypes. These novel genotypes have been designated Cryptosporidium bat genotypes VIII-XI. This first report of Cryptosporidium spp. in Australian flying foxes indicates zooanthroponotic transmission of Cryptosporidium from humans to flying foxes within a captive environment and extends the diversity of this globally important parasite.",eng,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The epidemic demonstrated the importance of improving readiness in at-risk countries and remaining prepared for Ebola and other health threats. The devastation caused by Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is well recognized; what is less widely recognized is that in these countries more people probably died because of Ebola than from Ebola.

Until the past decade, it has been seriously underrated as a global health threat. Major gaps exist in efforts to comprehend the burden nationally and globally, especially in developing nations, due to a lack of accurate data for monitoring and surveillance. Early attempts to obtain accurate data, discussed in this article, seem to have been cast aside so, at present, these needs remain unmet. Existing international efforts to assemble information fall far short of requirements. Current estimates are imprecise, only providing a rough picture, and probably underestimate the disease burden. The methodologies that are currently used, and that are discussed in this Perspectives article, are inadequate for providing a complete and accurate assessment of the prevalence of diabetes mellitus. International consensus on uniform standards and criteria for reporting national data on diabetes mellitus prevalence as well as for common complications of diabetes mellitus and mortality need to be developed.",eng,Nature reviews.

The case of the Dutch-Nordic Consortium.,"We analyzed an attempt to develop and clinically test a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for the developing world, undertaken by public health institutions from the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland: the Dutch Nordic Consortium (DNC), between 1990 and 2000. Our review shows that the premature termination of the project was due less to technological and scientific challenges and more to managerial challenges and institutional policies. Various impeding events, financial and managerial challenges gradually soured the initially enthusiastic collaborative spirit until near the end the consortium struggled to complete the minimum objectives of the project. By the end of 1998, a tetravalent prototype vaccine had been made that proved safe and immunogenic in Phase 1 trials in adults and toddlers in Finland. The planned next step, to test the vaccine in Asia in infants, did not meet approval by the local authorities in Vietnam nor later in the Philippines and the project eventually stopped.The Dutch DNC member, the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) learned important lessons, which subsequently were applied in a following vaccine technology transfer project, resulting in the availability at affordable prices for the developing world of a conjugate vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b. We conclude that vaccine development in the public domain with technology transfer as its ultimate aim requires major front-end funding, committed leadership at the highest institutional level sustained for many years and a competent recipient-manufacturer, which needs to be involved at a very early stage of the development.At the national level, RIVM's policy to consolidate its national manufacturing task through securing a key global health position in support of a network of public vaccine manufacturers proved insufficiently supported by the relevant ministries of the Dutch government. Difficulties to keep up with high costs, high-risk innovative vaccine development and production in a public sector setting led to the gradual loss of production tasks and to the 2009 Government decision to privatize the vaccine production tasks of the Institute.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27388421,10.1371/journal.pone.0158762,Predictors of Outcome in Traumatic Brain Injury: New Insight Using Receiver Operating Curve Indices and Bayesian Network Analysis.,"Traumatic brain injury remains a global health problem. Understanding the relative importance of outcome predictors helps optimize our treatment strategies by informing assessment protocols, clinical decisions and trial designs. In this study we establish importance ranking for outcome predictors based on receiver operating indices to identify key predictors of outcome and create simple predictive models. We then explore the associations between key outcome predictors using Bayesian networks to gain further insight into predictor importance.--NEW SECTION--We analyzed the corticosteroid randomization after significant head injury (CRASH) trial database of 10008 patients and included patients for whom demographics, injury characteristics, computer tomography (CT) findings and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GCS) were recorded (total of 13 predictors, which would be available to clinicians within a few hours following the injury in 6945 patients). Predictions of clinical outcome (death or severe disability at 6 months) were performed using logistic regression models with 5-fold cross validation. Predictive performance was measured using standardized partial area (pAUC) under the receiver operating curve (ROC) and we used Delong test for comparisons. Variable importance ranking was based on pAUC targeted at specificity (pAUCSP) and sensitivity (pAUCSE) intervals of 90-100%. Probabilistic associations were depicted using Bayesian networks.--NEW SECTION--Complete AUC analysis showed very good predictive power (AUC = 0.8237, 95% CI: 0.8138-0.8336) for the complete model. Specificity focused importance ranking highlighted age, pupillary, motor responses, obliteration of basal cisterns/3rd ventricle and midline shift. Interestingly when targeting model sensitivity, the highest-ranking variables were age, severe extracranial injury, verbal response, hematoma on CT and motor response. Simplified models, which included only these key predictors, had similar performance (pAUCSP = 0.6523, 95% CI: 0.6402-0.6641 and pAUCSE = 0.6332, 95% CI: 0.62-0.6477) compared to the complete models (pAUCSP = 0.6664, 95% CI: 0.6543-0.679, pAUCSE = 0.6436, 95% CI: 0.6289-0.6585, de Long p value 0.1165 and 0.3448 respectively). Bayesian networks showed the predictors that did not feature in the simplified models were associated with those that did.--NEW SECTION--We demonstrate that importance based variable selection allows simplified predictive models to be created while maintaining prediction accuracy. Variable selection targeting specificity confirmed key components of clinical assessment in TBI whereas sensitivity based ranking suggested extracranial injury as one of the important predictors. These results help refine our approach to head injury assessment, decision-making and outcome prediction targeted at model sensitivity and specificity. Bayesian networks proved to be a comprehensive tool for depicting probabilistic associations for key predictors giving insight into why the simplified model has maintained accuracy.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The literature on accountability spans various disciplines and research traditions, with differing interpretations. There has been little transfer of ideas and concepts from other disciplines to public health and global health. In the frame of a study of accountability of (international) non-governmental organisations in local health systems, we carried out a meta-narrative review to address this gap. Our research questions were: (1) What are the main approaches to accountability in the selected research traditions? (2) How is accountability defined? (3) Which current accountability approaches are relevant for the organisation and regulation of local health systems and its multiple actors?--NEW SECTION--The search covered peer-reviewed journals, monographs and readers published between 1992 and 2012 from political science, public administration, organisational sociology, ethics and development studies. 34 papers were selected and analysed.--NEW SECTION--Our review confirms the wide range of approaches to the conceptualisation of accountability. The definition of accountability used by the authors allows the categorisation of these approaches into four groups: the institutionalist, rights-based, individual choice and collective action group. These four approaches can be considered to be complementary.--NEW SECTION--We argue that in order to effectively achieve public accountability, accountability strategies are to be complementary and synergistic.",eng,BMJ open,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Metformin is the most common drug prescribed for patients with this disorder. Consequently, understanding the genetic pathways involved in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug can have a considerable effect on the personalized treatment of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we evaluated the association between rs11212617 polymorphism of ATM gene and rs628031 of SLC22A1 gene with response to treatment in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. We genotyped rs11212617 and rs628031 polymorphism by PCR based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and assessed the role of this polymorphisms on response to treatment in 140 patients who have been recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and were under monotherapy with metformin for 6 months. Response to metformin was defined by HbA1c and fasting blood sugar (FBS) values. Based on such evaluations, patients were divided into two groups: responders (n= 63) and non-responders (n= 77). No significant association was found between these polymorphisms and response to treatment (OR= 0.86, [95% CI 0.52-1.41], P= 0.32) for rs11212617 and (OR= 0.45, [95% CI 0.64-1.76], P= 0.45) for rs 628031.

Yet the role that the private sector plays in the delivery of health services is poorly understood. Using data for the period 1990-2013 from 205 Demographic and Health Surveys in seventy low- and middle-income countries, I analyzed the use of the private sector for the treatment of diarrhea and of fever or cough in children, for antenatal care, for institutional deliveries, and as a source of modern contraception for women. I found that private providers were the dominant source of treatment for childhood illnesses but not for the other services. I also found no evidence of increased use of the private sector over time. There is tremendous variation in use of the private sector across countries and health services. Urban and wealthier women disproportionately use the private sector, compared to rural and poorer women. The private sector plays an important role in providing coverage, but strategies to further engage the sector, if they are to be effective, will need to take into consideration the variation in its use.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016

All stages of CKD are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morbidity, premature mortality, and/or decreased quality of life. CKD is usually asymptomatic until later stages and accurate prevalence data are lacking. Thus we sought to determine the prevalence of CKD globally, by stage, geographical location, gender and age. A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies estimating CKD prevalence in general populations was conducted through literature searches in 8 databases. We assessed pooled data using a random effects model. Of 5,842 potential articles, 100 studies of diverse quality were included, comprising 6,908,440 patients. Global mean(95%CI) CKD prevalence of 5 stages 13·4%(11·7-15·1%), and stages 3-5 was 10·6%(9·2-12·2%). Weighting by study quality did not affect prevalence estimates. CKD prevalence by stage was Stage-1 (eGFR>90+ACR>30): 3·5% (2·8-4·2%); Stage-2 (eGFR 60-89+ACR>30): 3·9% (2·7-5·3%); Stage-3 (eGFR 30-59): 7·6% (6·4-8·9%); Stage-4 = (eGFR 29-15): 0·4% (0·3-0·5%); and Stage-5 (eGFR<15): 0·1% (0·1-0·1%).

BCG is the only vaccine used for about 100 years against TB, but the reasons for protection variability in populations remain unclear. To improve BCG efficacy and develop a strategy for new vaccines, the underlying genetic differences among BCG subtypes should be understood urgently. Methods and Findings. Human B cell epitope data were collected from the Immune Epitope Database. Epitope sequences were mapped with those of 15 genomes, including 13 BCGs, M. bovis AF2122/97, and M. tuberculosis H37Rv, to identify epitopes distribution. Among 398 experimentally verified B cell epitopes, 321 (80.7%) were conserved, while the remaining 77 (19.3%) were lost to varying degrees in BCGs. The variable protective efficacy of BCGs may result from the degree of B cell epitopes deficiency. Conclusions. Here we firstly analyzed the genetic characteristics of BCGs based on B cell epitopes and found that B cell epitopes distribution may contribute to vaccine efficacy.

The studies involved 208 participants (aged 49.2 ± 8.3 years) and utilized a substantial range of resveratrol doses (75-3000 mg/day). Study durations were a minimum of 2 weeks (14-90 days). Seven studies indicated no significant change in body mass index or body weight (P > 0.05), and three studies showed no improvements in fat mass, fat volume, or abdominal fat distribution (P > 0.05). Four studies included measurements of inflammatory markers, with three of these finding resveratrol supplementation to have a significant positive effect (P > 0.05).--NEW SECTION--Based on the included studies, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the recommendation of resveratrol supplements in management of obesity. However, there were significant but not entirely consistent anti-inflammatory effects after resveratrol supplementation in overweight and obese individuals.",eng,Metabolic syndrome and related disorders,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, there is still much debate around whether achieving authenticity in terms of in-depth collaboration between community and academic partners is possible while pursuing academic expectations for quality. This article describes the community-based methodology for a qualitative study to explore intimate partner violence and HIV/AIDS among women in sex work, or female sex workers, and their male partners in Karnataka, South India. Developed through collaborative processes, the study methodology followed an interpretive approach to qualitative inquiry, with three key components including long-term partnerships, knowledge exchange, and orientation toward action. We then discuss lessons learned on how to pursue authenticity in terms of truly collaborative processes with inherent value that also contribute to, rather than hinder, the instrumental goal of enhancing the quality and relevance of the research outcomes.",eng,Qualitative health research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017
27378094,10.1002/14651858.CD010123.pub2,Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) strategy for children under five.,"More than 7.5 million children younger than age five living in low- and middle-income countries die every year. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity and to improve quality of care by improving the delivery of a variety of curative and preventive medical and behavioral interventions at health facilities, at home, and in the community.--NEW SECTION--To evaluate the effects of programs that implement the IMCI strategy in terms of death, nutritional status, quality of care, coverage with IMCI deliverables, and satisfaction of beneficiaries.--NEW SECTION--We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE, Ovid; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EbscoHost; the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Virtual Health Library (VHL); the WHO Library & Information Networks for Knowledge Database (WHOLIS); the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science; Population Information Online (POPLINE); the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP); and the Global Health, Ovid and Health Management, ProQuest database. We performed searches until 30 June 2015 and supplemented these by searching revised bibliographies and by contacting experts to identify ongoing and unpublished studies.--NEW SECTION--We sought to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-after (CBA) studies with at least two intervention and two control sites evaluating the generic IMCI strategy or its adaptation in children younger than age five, and including at minimum efforts to improve health care worker skills for case management. We excluded studies in which IMCI was accompanied by other interventions including conditional cash transfers, food supplementation, and employment. The comparison group received usual health services without provision of IMCI.--NEW SECTION--Two review authors independently screened searches, selected trials, and extracted, analysed and tabulated data. We used inverse variance for cluster trials and an intracluster co-efficient of 0.01 when adjustment had not been made in the primary study. We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach to assess the certainty of evidence.--NEW SECTION--Two cluster-randomised trials (India and Bangladesh) and two controlled before-after studies (Tanzania and India) met our inclusion criteria. Strategies included training of health care staff, management strengthening of health care systems (all four studies), and home visiting (two studies). The two studies from India included care packages targeting the neonatal period.One trial in Bangladesh estimated that child mortality may be 13% lower with IMCI, but the confidence interval (CI) included no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.10; 5090 participants; low-certainty evidence). One CBA study in Tanzania gave almost identical estimates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.05; 1932 participants).One trial in India examined infant and neonatal mortality by implementing the integrated management of neonatal and childhood illness (IMNCI) strategy including post-natal home visits. Neonatal and infant mortality may be lower in the IMNCI group compared with the control group (infant mortality hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.94; neonatal mortality HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03; one trial, 60,480 participants; low-certainty evidence).We estimated the effect of IMCI on any mortality measured by combining infant and child mortality in the one IMCI and the one IMNCI trial. Mortality may be reduced by IMCI (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93; two trials, 65,570 participants; low-certainty evidence).Two trials (India, Bangladesh) evaluated nutritional status and noted that there may be little or no effect on stunting (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.06; 5242 participants, two trials; low-certainty evidence) and there is probably little or no effect on wasting (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; two trials, 4288 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).The Tanzania CBA study showed similar results.Investigators measured quality of care by observing prescribing for common illnesses at health facilities (727 observations, two studies; very low-certainty evidence) and by observing prescribing by lay health care workers (1051 observations, three studies; very low-certainty evidence). We could not confirm a consistent effect on prescribing at health facilities or by lay health care workers, as certainty of the evidence was very low.For coverage of IMCI deliverables, we examined vaccine and vitamin A coverage, appropriate care seeking, and exclusive breast feeding. Two trials (India, Bangladesh) estimated vaccine coverage for measles and reported that there is probably little or no effect on measles vaccine coverage (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05; two trials, 4895 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with similar effects seen in the Tanzania CBA study. Two studies measured the third dose of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccine; and two measured vitamin A coverage, all providing little or no evidence of increased coverage with IMCI.Four studies (2 from India, and 1 each from Tanzania and Bangladesh) reported appropriate care seeking and derived information from careful questioning of mothers about recent illness. Some studies on effects of IMCI may report better care seeking behavior, but others do not report this.All four studies recorded maternal responses on exclusive breast feeding. They provided mixed results and very low-certainty evidence. Therefore, we do not know whether IMCI impacts exclusive breast feeding.No studies reported on the satisfaction of mothers and service users.--NEW SECTION--The mix of interventions examined in research studies evaluating the IMCI strategy varies, and some studies include specific inputs to improve neonatal health. Most studies were conducted in South Asia. Implementing the integrated management of childhood illness strategy may reduce child mortality, and packages that include interventions for the neonatal period may reduce infant mortality. IMCI may have little or no effect on nutritional status and probably has little or no effect on vaccine coverage. Maternal care seeking behavior may be more appropriate with IMCI, but study results have been mixed, providing evidence of very low certainty about whether IMCI has effects on adherence to exclusive breast feeding.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27376058,10.3389/fbioe.2016.00043,Lost in Translation: The Gap in Scientific Advancements and Clinical Application.,"The evolution of medicine and medical technology hinges on the successful translation of basic science research from the bench to clinical implementation at the bedside. Out of the increasing need to facilitate the transfer of scientific knowledge to patients, translational research has emerged. Significant leaps in improving global health, such as antibiotics, vaccinations, and cancer therapies, have all seen successes under this paradigm, yet today, it has become increasingly difficult to realize this ideal scenario. As hospital revenue demand increases, and financial support declines, clinician-protected research time has been limited. Researchers, likewise, have been forced to abandon time- and resource-consuming translational research to focus on publication-generating work to maintain funding and professional advancement. Compared to the surge in scientific innovation and new fields of science, realization of transformational scientific findings in device development and materials sciences has significantly lagged behind. Herein, we describe: how the current scientific paradigm struggles in the new health-care landscape; the obstacles met by translational researchers; and solutions, both public and private, to overcoming those obstacles. We must rethink the old dogma of academia and reinvent the traditional pathways of research in order to truly impact the health-care arena and ultimately those that matter most: the patient.",eng,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

To report the ocular findings in patients with hematopoietic malignancy with optic nerve involvement and abducens nerve palsy. Methods. The medical records of all cases of hematopoietic cancer with ophthalmic involvements seen in the Department of Ophthalmology of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine between 2009 and 2014 were reviewed. Results. Eight patients with hematopoietic cancer with optic nerve invasion or abducens nerve palsy were studied. The primary diseases were 3 cases of multiple myeloma, 1 case of acute lymphocytic leukemia, 1 case of follicular lymphoma, and 3 cases of AIDS-related lymphoma. Six cases had optic nerve invasion, 2 cases had abducens nerve palsy, and 1 case had optic nerve invasion of both eyes. The median visual acuity of eyes with optic nerve invasion was 0.885 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units. The final visual acuity of eyes with optic nerve invasion was 1.25 logMAR units, and that of those with sixth-nerve palsy was -0.1 logMAR units. Six cases died during the five-year follow-up period. An ophthalmic involvement in patients with hematopoietic cancer, especially AIDS-related lymphoma, was associated with poor prognosis. Conclusion. Because ophthalmic involvement in patients with hematopoietic malignancy has a poor prognosis, an early diagnosis of the cancers by the ophthalmologic findings by ophthalmologists could improve the prognosis.",eng,Case reports in ophthalmological medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, most existing approaches are not scalable to include multiple biomarkers. As a solution, we have combined commercial flat panel OLED display technology with protein microarray technology to enable high-density fluorescent, programmable, multiplexed biorecognition in a compact and disposable configuration with clinical-level sensitivity. Our approach leverages advances in commercial display technology to reduce pre-functionalized biosensor substrate costs to pennies per cm(2). Here, we demonstrate quantitative detection of IgG antibodies to multiple viral antigens in patient serum samples with detection limits for human IgG in the 10 pg/mL range. We also demonstrate multiplexed detection of antibodies to the HPV16 proteins E2, E6, and E7, which are circulating biomarkers for cervical as well as head and neck cancers.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A significant proportion of patients experience skeletal muscle wasting and loss of strength as a comorbidity of their COPD, a condition that severely impacts on their quality of life and survival. At present, the lung pathology is considered to be largely irreversible; however, the inherent adaptability of muscle tissue offers therapeutic opportunities to tackle muscle wasting and potentially reverse or delay the progression of this aspect of the disease, to improve patients' quality of life. Muscle wasting in COPD is complex, with contributions from a number of factors including inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, growth and anabolic hormones, nutritional status, and physical activity. In this review, we discuss current and emerging therapeutic approaches to treat muscle wasting in COPD, including a number of pharmacological therapies that are in development for muscle atrophy in other pathological states that could be of relevance for treating muscle wasting in COPD patients.",eng,Pharmacology & therapeutics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27372851,10.1016/j.mehy.2016.05.006,Chronic l-menthol-induced browning of white adipose tissue hypothesis: A putative therapeutic regime for combating obesity and improving metabolic health.,"Obesity constitutes a serious global health concern reaching pandemic prevalence rates. The existence of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans has provoked intense research interest in the role of this metabolically active tissue in whole-body energy balance and body weight regulation. A number of environmental, physiological, pathological, and pharmacological stimuli have been proposed to induce BAT-mediated thermogenesis and functional thermogenic BAT-like activity in white adipose tissue (WAT), opening new avenues for therapeutic strategies based on enhancing the number of beige adipocytes in WAT.--NEW SECTION--Recent evidence support a role of l-menthol cooling, mediated by TRPM8 receptor, on UCP1-dependent thermogenesis and BAT-like activity in classical WAT depots along with the recruitment of BAT at specific anatomical sites. l-Menthol-induced BAT thermogenesis has been suggested to occur by a β-adrenergic-independent mechanism, avoiding potential side-effects due to extensive β-adrenergic stimulation mediated by available beta receptor agonists. l-Menthol has been also linked to the activation of the cold-gated ion channel TRPA1. However, its role in l-menthol-induced UCP1-dependent thermogenic activity in BAT and WAT remains undetermined. White adipose tissue plasticity has important clinical implications for obesity prevention and/or treatment because higher levels of UCP1-dependent thermogenesis can lead to enhanced energy expenditure at a considerable extent. We hypothesize that chronic dietary l-menthol treatment could induce TRPM8- and TRPA1-dependent WAT adaptations, resembling BAT-like activity, and overall improve whole-body metabolic health in obese and overweight individuals.--NEW SECTION--The putative impact of chronic l-menthol dietary treatment on the stimulation of BAT-like activity in classical WAT depots in humans remains unknown. A detailed experimental design has been proposed to investigate the hypothesized l-menthol-induced browning of WAT. If our hypothesis was to be confirmed, TRPM8/TRPA1-induced metabolic adaptations of WAT to BAT-like activity could provide a promising novel therapeutic approach for increasing energy expenditure, regulating body weight, and preventing obesity and its related co-morbidities in humans.",eng,Medical hypotheses,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27372850,10.1016/j.mehy.2016.05.010,Could angiotensin-(1-7) be connected with improvement of microvascular function in diabetic patients? Angiotensin-(1-7) iontophoresis may provide the answer.,"Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder with significant global health care burden, causes chronic microvascular and macrovascular complications that still comprise a therapeutic challenge. Angiotensin-(1-7), a heptapeptide with vasodilatory properties, has been found to restore vascular reactivity and endothelial cell function, mostly in experiments on larger isolated animal vessels and in cell cultures. The presented hypothesis suggests that angiotensin-(1-7) might have beneficial effects on microvascular function that is damaged in diabetic patients, alleviating endothelial dysfunction and increasing microvascular reactivity to various vasoactive agents in diabetes. It is further proposed that iontophoresis with angiotensin-(1-7) might be used to explore this potential beneficial effect, as well as provide a possible future therapeutic delivery method for angiotensin-(1-7). Since other peptides and proteins have been previously tested and used in iontophoretic transdermal delivery, it is plausible that angiotensin-(1-7) would be a suitable candidate for transdermal iontophoretic application for research (and potentially therapeutic) purposes. If confirmed, the delineated hypothesis would have immense implications for more effective care of diabetic patients, as well as for better understanding of microcirculatory pathophysiological mechanisms in diabetes.",eng,Medical hypotheses,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Although enteric fever can be treated appropriately with antibiotics, an increasing number of antibiotic resistant Salmonella strains is detected. While two vaccines against typhoid fever are currently on the market, their availability in subtropical endemic areas is limited because these products need to be kept in uninterrupted cold chains. Hence, the development of a thermally stable vaccine that induces mucosal immune responses would greatly improve human health in endemic areas. Here, we have combined the high structural stability of Salmonella typhi outer membrane proteins (porins) with their microencapsulation into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to generate an orally applicable vaccine. Encapsulated porins were protected from acidic degradation and exhibited enhanced immunogenicity following oral administration. In particular, the vaccine elicited strong S. typhi-specific B cell responses in Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. In sum, PLGA microencapsulation substantially improved the efficacy of oral vaccination against S. typhi.",eng,Vaccine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We assessed the effect of treatment on HRQL and its association with prognosis in H&N cancer.--NEW SECTION--Patients with H&N cancer in whom HRQL was assessed before and after treatment. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&N35 instruments were used. Association of changes in patients' HRQL after treatment with Loco-Regional Recurrence (LRR) and Overall Survival (OS) was investigated.--NEW SECTION--One hundred sixty patients were included; scales of the baseline assessment of HRQL were moderately associated with LRR and OS, but the impact of treatment on most HRQL scales was strongly associated with OS. By multivariate analysis, baseline assessment of Global Health, Physical, HN Teeth, HN Dry mouth, and HN Cough scales, and impact of treatment on the Physical and Pain scales comprised independent variables associated with LRR. Male gender, positive lymph nodes, baseline assessment of Role, HN Pain, HN Cough, and impact of treatment on Emotion, Pain, Financial, HN Swallowing, HN Social contact, and the interaction of HN Pain-change in Pain scales were associated with OS. Both multivariate models were adjusted by the neoplasm's site of origin.--NEW SECTION--Aside from well-known clinical-pathologic prognostic factors in H&N cancers, HRQL assessment, both prior to and after treatment, provides significant prognostic information and should be measured.

27369317,10.1186/s12967-016-0946-1,Matrix- and plasma-derived peptides promote tissue-specific injury responses and wound healing in diabetic swine.,"Non-healing wounds are a major global health concern and account for the majority of non-traumatic limb amputations worldwide. However, compared to standard care practices, few advanced therapeutics effectively resolve these injuries stemming from cardiovascular disease, aging, and diabetes-related vasculopathies. While matrix turnover is disrupted in these injuries, debriding enzymes may promote healing by releasing matrix fragments that induce cell migration, proliferation, and morphogenesis, and plasma products may also stimulate these processes. Thus, we created matrix- and plasma-derived peptides, Comb1 and UN3, which induce cellular injury responses in vitro, and accelerate healing in rodent models of non-healing wounds. However, the effects of these peptides in non-healing wounds in diabetes are not known. Here, we interrogated whether these peptides stimulate healing in a diabetic porcine model highly reminiscent of human healing impairments in type 1 and type 2-diabetes.--NEW SECTION--After 3-6 weeks of streptozotocin-induced diabetes, full-thickness wounds were surgically created on the backs of adult female Yorkshire swine under general anesthesia. Comb1 and UN3 peptides or sterile saline (negative control) were administered to wounds daily for 3-7 days. Following sacrifice, wound tissues were harvested, and quantitative histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed for wound closure, angiogenesis and granulation tissue deposition, along with quantitative molecular analyses of factors critical for angiogenesis, epithelialization, and dermal matrix remodeling.--NEW SECTION--Comb1 and UN3 significantly increase re-epithelialization and angiogenesis in diabetic porcine wounds, compared to saline-treated controls. Additionally, fluorescein-conjugated Comb1 labels keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells in porcine wounds, and Far western blotting reveals these cell populations express multiple fluorescein-Comb1-interacting proteins in vitro. Further, peptide treatment increases mRNA expression of several pro-angiogenic, epithelializing, and matrix-remodeling factors, importantly including balanced inductions in matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1, lending further insight into their mechanisms.--NEW SECTION--Comb1 and UN3 stimulate wound resolution in diabetic Yorkshire swine through upregulation of multiple reparative growth factors and cytokines, especially matrix metalloproteinases and inhibitors that may aid in reversing the proteolytic imbalance characteristic of chronically inflamed non-healing wounds. Together, these peptides should have great therapeutic potential for all patients in need of healing, regardless of injury etiology.",eng,Journal of translational medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27369296,10.2196/jmir.4657,A Social Media mHealth Solution to Address the Needs of Dengue Prevention and Management in Sri Lanka.,"Sri Lanka has witnessed a series of dengue epidemics over the past five years, with the western province, home to the political capital of Colombo, bearing more than half of the dengue burden. Existing dengue monitoring prevention programs are exhausted as public health inspectors (PHIs) cope with increasing workloads and paper-based modes of surveillance and education, characterizing a reactive system unable to cope with the enormity of the problem. On the other hand, the unprecedented proliferation and affordability of mobile phones since 2009 and a supportive political climate have thus far remained unexploited for the use of mobile-based interventions for dengue management.--NEW SECTION--To conduct a needs assessment of PHIs in Colombo with respect to their dengue-related tasks and develop a new mobile-based system to address these needs while strengthening existing systems.--NEW SECTION--One-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted with 29 PHIs to a) gain a nuanced, in-depth understanding of the current state of surveillance practices, b) understand the logistical, technological and social challenges they confront, and c) identify opportunities for mobile-based interventions. Quantitative analysis included simple descriptive statistics while qualitative analysis comprised textual analysis of 209 pages of transcripts (or nearly 600 minutes of conversations) using grounded theory approaches.--NEW SECTION--Current paper-based data collection practices for dengue surveillance involved a circuitous, time consuming process that could take between 7-10 days to officially report and record a single case. PHIs confronted challenges in terms of unreliable, standalone GIS devices, delays in registering mosquito breeding sites and lack of engagement from communities while delivering dengue education. These findings, in concert with a high motivation to use mobile-based systems, informed the development of Mo-Buzz, a mobile-based system that integrates three components - digitized surveillance, dynamic disease mapping and digitized dengue education - on a common platform. The system was developed through an iterative, evolutionary, collaborative process, consistent with the Spiral model of software development and is currently being used by all 55 PHIs in the CMC system.--NEW SECTION--Given the entrenched nature of existing paper-based systems in PHIs' work habits, we expect a gradual adoption curve for Mo-Buzz in the future. Equally, we expect variable adoption of the system with respect to its specific components, and specific PHI sub-groups (younger versus older). The Mo-Buzz intervention is a response to multiple calls by the global mHealth community for collaborations in the area of mobile interventions for global health. Our experience revealed that the benefits of this paradigm lies in alleviating country-specific public health challenges through a commonly shared understanding of cultural mores, and sharing of knowledge and technologies. We call upon future researchers to further dissect the applicability of the Spiral Model of software development to mHealth interventions and contribute to the mHealth evidence debate from theoretical and applied perspectives.",eng,Journal of medical Internet research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Sometimes there is need to decrease the cycle length of an existing state-transition model to reduce error in outcomes resulting from discretization of the underlying continuous-time phenomena or to increase the cycle length to gain computational efficiency. Cycle length conversion is also frequently required if a new state-transition model is built using observational data that have a different measurement interval than the model's cycle length. We show that a commonly used method of converting transition probabilities to different cycle lengths is incorrect and can provide imprecise estimates of model outcomes. We present an accurate approach that is based on finding the root of a transition probability matrix using eigendecomposition. We present underlying mathematical challenges of converting cycle length in state-transition models and provide numerical approximation methods when the eigendecomposition method fails. Several examples and analytical proofs show that our approach is more general and leads to more accurate estimates of model outcomes than the commonly used approach.

These partnerships are complex interventions. This study focused on unpacking the characteristics of global partnerships that provide continuing education for health professionals. A realist approach underpinned the research design to identify the mechanisms that shape successful global partnerships. Two case studies focusing on global continuing medical education (CME) were studied longitudinally using a realist evaluation approach. To complement that finding, published research reports of global CME partnerships were synthesized using a realist synthesis approach. Data were collected over a three-year period and included interviews, participant observations, document reviews, and surveys. A hybrid thematic approach guided the data analysis. The study results suggested that global CME partnerships are highly dependent on human factors. On the one hand, motivational factors related to individual players help to shape the partnership goals, directions, and outcomes. On the other hand, relational factors such as trust, communication, and understanding play a key role in developing and sustaining global partnerships. As such, these partnerships highly rely on the individuals who champion the partnership at the country level or at the partnership level and in their ability to build relationships as well as empower key stakeholders.",eng,Health systems and reform,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, many young professionals learn their leadership skills by trial and error as they advance through their careers. Though some countries are making efforts to incorporate leadership training programs into their medical curricula, the provision of such training is available in too few countries. To fill this gap and contribute to building capacity for future leadership among health professionals worldwide, the InterAcademy Partnership for Health launched its Young Physician Leaders (YPL) program in 2011. The program provides a tailored workshop on leadership; the opportunity, via the World Health Summit, to engage with global leaders in the field of medicine and health; a matchmaking mentorship scheme; a network of peers with whom to share experiences and exchange best practices; and an interactive website to post real-time professional information and gain visibility both nationally and internationally. To date, some 107 YPL, nominated by some 30 academies of science and medicine and six other institutions, have participated in the scheme. In addition, some 30 YPL alumni from about 20 countries were selected to attend the recent World Health Assembly (WHA69). As well as gaining first-hand experience of the decision-making processes of the WHA, the event helped build their individual capacities because they had the opportunity to link with their national decision makers in global health policy.

Recent studies indicate gut microbiota play important role on the pathogenesis and metabolic disturbance of T2DM. As an effective mean of regulating gut microbiota, probiotics are live micro-organisms that are believed to provide a specific health benefit on the host. Whether probiotic supplementation could improve metabolic profiles by modifying gut microbiota in T2DM or not is still in controversy.The aim of the study is to assess the effect of probiotic supplementation on metabolic profiles in T2DM.We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library up to 12 April 2016. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias of included studies. Data were pooled by using the random-effect model and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified (I).A total of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included.

This study was performed to investigate the prevalence of comorbidities and the association between comorbidities and the QOL among Chinese colorectal cancer survivors (CCS).--NEW SECTION--A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,398 CCS between April and July 2013 in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. All the participants were asked to complete a simplified Chinese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment quality of life version 3 questionnaire and questions on sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities. In order to mitigate the bias caused by confounding factors, multiple linear regression models were employed to calculate the adjusted means of QOL scores.--NEW SECTION--The proportion of participants without any comorbidity was only 20.2%. The CCS with comorbidities except hypertension scored significantly lower on the European Organization for Research and Treatment quality of life version 3 questionnaire global health and functioning scales and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General scales but higher on the European Organization for Research and Treatment quality of life version 3 questionnaire symptom scores, indicating that they had poorer QOL, particularly for cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, and musculoskeletal diseases.--NEW SECTION--There exists a significant association between comorbidities and QOL among Chinese CCS, and participants with comorbidities generally reported lower QOL scores.

Reasons for slow progress include inadequate commitment, investment, focus, scale, and quality of implementation of prevention and treatment interventions. The UNAIDS-Lancet Commission on Defeating AIDS-Advancing Global Health reported that the provision of large-scale, effective HIV prevention programmes has failed and called on stakeholders to ""get serious about HIV prevention"". An ambitious worldwide target has been set by UNAIDS to reduce new infections below 500 000 by 2020-a 75% reduction from 2010. Models show that such a reduction requires a combination of primary prevention interventions and preventative effects of treatment. Achievement of the target will require more effective delivery of HIV prevention for sufficient coverage in populations at greatest risk of infection ensuring that interventions that have proved effective are made available, barriers to their uptake are overcome, demand is created, and use is consistent and occurs at the right scale with high coverage. This paper discusses how programmatic targets for prevention in a worldwide plan could be used to re-energise the HIV prevention approach.

The prevention of neurotropic infections can be achieved through globally coordinated vaccination campaigns, which have successfully eradicated nonzoonotic agents such as the variola viruses and, hopefully soon, poliovirus. This review discusses vaccines that are currently available or under development for zoonotic flaviviruses and alphaviruses, including Japanese and tick-borne encephalitis, yellow fever, West Nile, dengue, Zika, encephalitic equine viruses, and chikungunya. Also discussed are nonzoonotic agents, including measles and human herpesviruses, as well as select bacterial, fungal, and protozoal pathogens. While therapeutic vaccines will be required to treat a multitude of ongoing infections of the nervous system, the ideal vaccination strategy is pre-exposure vaccination, with the ultimate goals of minimizing disease associated with zoonotic viruses and the total eradication of nonzoonotic agents.",eng,Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This places a high economic burden on these countries, which usually have limited capacity to address this public health problem. We developed a guided self-assessment tool for describing national capacity for NCD prevention and control. The purpose of this tool was to assist countries in identifying key opportunities and gaps in NCD capacity. It was piloted in three countries between 2012 and 2013: Mozambique, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. The tool includes details about NCD burden; health system infrastructure and primary care services; workforce capacity; surveillance; planning, policy, and program management; and partnerships. In the three pilot countries, the tool helped to identify differences in capacity needs pertaining to staff, training, and surveillance, but similarities were also found related to NCD challenges and opportunities. The NCD tool increased our understanding of needs and critical capacity elements for addressing NCDs in the three pilot countries.

The number of patients with poor self-care behaviours continues to rise despite ongoing health education. Knowledge and self-efficacy are important factors that influence self-care behaviour; however, very few articles have examined the relationships among them.--NEW SECTION--Cross-sectional and correlational design.--NEW SECTION--Subject recruitment was conducted by purposive sampling in the renal outpatient clinics and dialysis centres of two teaching hospitals in northern Taiwan. A total of 247 patients with chronic kidney disease (stages 1-5) were enrolled.--NEW SECTION--(1) Knowledge was positively correlated with self-efficacy (r = 0·41, p < 0·01) and with self-care (r = 0·18, p < 0·01). Self-efficacy (r = 0·44, p < 0·01) as well as age (r = 0·15, p < 0·01) were positively correlated with self-care. (2) The relationship between knowledge and self-care was fully mediated by self-efficacy (z = 4·82, p < 0·001) and the effect was 50%.--NEW SECTION--The results showed that self-efficacy was a crucial mediator between knowledge and self-care. In addition to providing knowledge to chronic kidney disease patients, healthcare professionals should also offer strategies that can enhance self-efficacy to increase self-care behaviours in chronic kidney disease patients and implement effective disease management.--NEW SECTION--Incorporate self-efficacy strategies into the process of health education to improve knowledge and the effectiveness of self-care.

The Global Health Observatory of the World Health Organization reported that approximately 13% of all deaths are caused by cancer. In the 2012 the estimated total number of cancer deaths was 1.75 million, 56% in men and 44% in women. Gender is recognized to play a role in cancer incidence, progression and response to therapy. Besides anatomical and hormonal disparities, genetic differences should be considered when assessing the effects of gender on cancer. Accumulating evidence also support the existence of sex-driven differences in immune responses. Until today clinical trials and research in animal models have been gender unbalanced. In consideration of the differences between sexes observed in cancer, sex should represent an important stratification factor to be included in all randomized clinical trials for a better understanding of biological differences between men and women, which may yield improved targeted therapies.",eng,Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

PC interventions resulted in significant improvement in 1 domain and ≥3 domains of HRQoL measures in 66.7% and 27.1% of the studies, respectively. There was a significant improvement in at least 1 domain in 18 of 32 studies using generic and 16 of 21 studies using disease-specific measures. When the Short Form 36 Items Health Survey (SF-36) measure was used, PC interventions had a moderate impact on social functioning (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.14, 1.04), general health (SMD = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.12, 0.59), and physical functioning (SMD = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.11, 0.48).

Existing measures may have minimal to moderate sensitivity to PC interventions, with evidence pointing more toward social functioning, general health, and physical functioning of the SF-36 measure. However, evidence generated from current non-PC-specific HRQoL measures is insufficient to judge the impact of PC interventions on HRQoL. The development of a suitable HRQoL measure for PC interventions may help generate better evidence for the contribution of pharmacist services to improving HRQoL.",eng,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The aim of the present study was to test the activity of an openly available FDA library against laboratory models of human intestinal nematode infections.--NEW SECTION--All 1,600 drugs were first screened against Ancylostoma ceylanicum third-stage larvae (L3). Active compounds were scrutinized and toxic compounds, drugs indicated solely for topical use, and already well-studied anthelmintics were excluded. The remaining hit compounds were tested in parallel against Trichuris muris first-stage larvae (L1), Heligmosomoides polygyrus third-stage larvae (L3), and adult stages of the three species in vitro. In vivo studies were performed in the H. polygyrus and T. muris mice models.--NEW SECTION--Fifty-four of the 1,600 compounds tested revealed an activity of > 60 % against A. ceylanicum L3 (hit rate of 3.4 %), following incubation at 200 μM for 72 h. Twelve compounds progressed into further screens. Adult A. ceylanicum were the least affected (1/12 compounds active at 50 μM), while eight of the 12 test compounds revealed activity against T. muris L1 (100 μM) and adults (50 μM), and H. polygyrus L3 (200 μM). Trichlorfon was the only compound active against all stages of A. ceylanicum, H. polygyrus and T. muris.

All patients underwent ARFI elastography and liver biopsy. In 87/97 patients, transient elastography (TE) was performed (M- and XL-probes). Patients were divided into two groups respectively: overweight: BMI <30 kg/m(2) (n = 61); and obese: BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) (n = 26).--NEW SECTION--Acoustic radiation force impulse elastography correlated with liver fibrosis in overweight (r = 0.84, P < 0.0001) and obese patients (r = 0.85, P < 0.0001), while no correlation was observed with steatosis, steatohepatitis and BMI. Area under the curve detecting liver cirrhosis for ARFI and TE were 0.97 in overweight and 0.94 and 0.92 in obese patients. In both groups, the failure rate was lower for ARFI than TE. ARFI of liver segment 8 showed a lower discordance than TE in both groups (overweight: 3% vs. 12%, P = 0.002; obese: 8% vs. 27%, P = 0.034). Steatosis and steatohepatitis were neither predictors of discordance nor of performance in LSM by ARFI or TE in both groups.--NEW SECTION--In overweight and obese patients, acoustic radiation force impulse can diagnose liver cirrhosis and significant fibrosis with high diagnostic accuracy.

Prevalence of dyslipidemia in diabetes is not uncommon since decades. Further, patients with type II diabetes have 2-4 folds more risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Plants with antioxidant potential are known to have beneficial effects in diabetes and its complications: Natural compounds, flavonoids particularly, ameliorate hyperglycemia as well as CVD. Here, we evaluated common wasteland weed Tephrosia purpurea, used traditionally as folk medicine to treat many disorders including diabetes. We studied the effect of 8-wk treatment of flavonoid-rich fraction of T. purpurea (FFTp) (40 mg/kg/day/p.o.) on various biochemical, cardiovascular and lenticular parameters on streptozotocin (STZ) (45 mg/kg, i.v.) induced type I diabetic rats. STZ administration produced significant hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and altered cardiac biomarkers like lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine kinase and reduced antioxidants in lenticular tissues of rats. Treatment with FFTp significantly prevented STZ-induced hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia as well as cardiovascular markers. We observed decreased rate of pressure development (+dp/dt) and decay (-dp/dt) in STZ diabetic hearts which was prevented by FFTp. Further, the soluble protein levels and the antioxidants were also elevated in the diabetic rats by the treatment. In conclusion, our data suggest that FFTp produces beneficial effects on diabetes induced cardiovascular complications and cataract. Such beneficial actions may be attributed to the antioxidant property of flavonoids, quercetin or rutin, present in T. purpurea.",eng,Indian journal of experimental biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) has published, every year for the last quarter century, the Yearbook of Medical Informatics, collating selected papers from various journals in an attempt to provide a summary of the academic medical informatics literature. The objective of this paper is to visualize the evolution of the medical informatics field over the last 25 years according to the frequency of word occurrences in the papers published in the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics.--NEW SECTION--A literature review was conducted examining the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics between 1992 and 2015. These references were collated into a reference manager application to examine the literature using keyword searches, word clouds, and topic clustering. The data was considered in its entirety, as well as segregated into 3 time periods to examine the evolution of main trends over time. Several methods were used, including word clouds, cluster maps, and custom developed web-based information dashboards.--NEW SECTION--The literature search resulted in a total of 1210 references published in the Yearbook, of which 213 references were excluded, resulting in 997 references for visualization. Overall, we found that publications were more technical and methods-oriented between 1992 and 1999; more clinically and patient-oriented between 2000 and 2009; and noted the emergence of ""big data"", decision support, and global health in the past decade between 2010 and 2015.

27358760,10.1007/s12553-016-0132-8,Cybercare 2.0: meeting the challenge of the global burden of disease in 2030.,"In this paper, we propose to advance and transform today's healthcare system using a model of networked health care called Cybercare. Cybercare means ""health care in cyberspace"" - for example, doctors consulting with patients via videoconferencing across a distributed network; or patients receiving care locally - in neighborhoods, ""minute clinics,"" and homes - using information technologies such as telemedicine, smartphones, and wearable sensors to link to tertiary medical specialists. This model contrasts with traditional health care, in which patients travel (often a great distance) to receive care from providers in a central hospital. The Cybercare model shifts health care provision from hospital to home; from specialist to generalist; and from treatment to prevention. Cybercare employs advanced technology to deliver services efficiently across the distributed network - for example, using telemedicine, wearable sensors and cell phones to link patients to specialists and upload their medical data in near-real time; using information technology (IT) to rapidly detect, track, and contain the spread of a global pandemic; or using cell phones to manage medical care in a disaster situation. Cybercare uses seven ""pillars"" of technology to provide medical care: genomics; telemedicine; robotics; simulation, including virtual and augmented reality; artificial intelligence (AI), including intelligent agents; the electronic medical record (EMR); and smartphones. All these technologies are evolving and blending. The technologies are integrated functionally because they underlie the Cybercare network, and/or form part of the care for patients using that distributed network. Moving health care provision to a networked, distributed model will save money, improve outcomes, facilitate access, improve security, increase patient and provider satisfaction, and may mitigate the international global burden of disease.

To assess the risks and benefits, we investigated health-related quality of life (HRQOL). 817 untreated CLL patients received either FC or FCR within the GCLLSG CLL8 trial. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life Questionnaire C30 was sent to all patients at baseline, after 3, 6, and 12 months and then yearly as follow-up. A total of 769 (94%) of 817 patients completed at least one questionnaire. Comparing HRQOL of CLL patients with the general German population, CLL patients' health declined in most scales except for global health and pain. No major differences in HRQOL were found during treatment or follow-up between both treatment arms. Females were more likely to have treatment-related symptoms than males. Although FCR was associated with more side effects, this did not influence HRQOL.

27355570,10.1038/nature18952,Vaccine protection against Zika virus from Brazil.,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that is responsible for the current epidemic in Brazil and the Americas. ZIKV has been causally associated with fetal microcephaly, intrauterine growth restriction, and other birth defects in both humans and mice. The rapid development of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine is a global health priority, but very little is currently known about ZIKV immunology and mechanisms of immune protection. Here we show that a single immunization with a plasmid DNA vaccine or a purified inactivated virus vaccine provides complete protection in susceptible mice against challenge with a strain of ZIKV involved in the outbreak in northeast Brazil. This ZIKV strain has recently been shown to cross the placenta and to induce fetal microcephaly and other congenital malformations in mice. We produced DNA vaccines expressing ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prM-Env), as well as a series of deletion mutants. The prM-Env DNA vaccine, but not the deletion mutants, afforded complete protection against ZIKV, as measured by absence of detectable viraemia following challenge, and protective efficacy correlated with Env-specific antibody titers. Adoptive transfer of purified IgG from vaccinated mice conferred passive protection, and depletion of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes in vaccinated mice did not abrogate this protection. These data demonstrate that protection against ZIKV challenge can be achieved by single-shot subunit and inactivated virus vaccines in mice and that Env-specific antibody titers represent key immunologic correlates of protection. Our findings suggest that the development of a ZIKV vaccine for humans is likely to be achievable.",eng,Nature,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The imbalance has given rise to concern about whether the benefits of these advances, namely new and better tests, treatments, risk identification, and prevention strategies, will be shared and available to those living in less resourced reaches of the globe. In effort to give voice to researchers, an informal survey about barriers to advancing translational medicine was administered to attendees of the 11th Asia Pacific Conference on Human Genetics, 2015, Hanoi. The overall goal of the survey was to identify unmet needs and rank their importance. Most attendees completed the survey. Not surprisingly funding is indicated as a major need. Respondents reported that lack of bioinformatics and computational tools, trained data scientists and access to datasets is creating a significant lag behind better resourced regions.

For family planning, costed implementation plans (CIPs) are developed through a strategic government-led consultative process that results in a detailed plan for program activities and an estimate of the funding required to achieve an established set of goals. Since 2009, many countries have developed CIPs. Conventionally, the CIP approach has not been defined with partnerships as a focal point; nevertheless, cooperation between key stakeholders is vital to CIP development and execution. Uganda launched a CIP in November 2014, thus providing an opportunity to examine the process through a partnership lens. This article describes Uganda's CIP development process in detail, grounded in a framework for assessing partnerships, and provides the findings from 22 key informant interviews. Findings reveal strengths in Uganda's CIP development process, such as willingness to adapt and strong senior management support. However, the evaluation also highlighted challenges, including district health officers (DHOs), who are a key group of implementers, feeling excluded from the development process. There was also a lack of planning around long-term partnership practices that could help address anticipated execution challenges. The authors recommend that future CIP development efforts use a long-term partnership strategy that fosters accountability by encompassing both the short-term goal of developing the CIP and the longer-term goal of achieving the CIP objectives. Although this study focused on Uganda's CIP for family planning, its lessons have implications for any policy or strategy development efforts that require multiple stakeholders to ensure successful execution.",eng,"Global health, science and practice",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Secondary pathologies following TBI may be associated with chronic neurodegenerative disorders and an enhanced likelihood of developing dementia-like disease in later life. There are currently no approved drugs for mitigating the acute or chronic effects of TBI.--NEW SECTION--The effects of the drug pomalidomide (Pom), an FDA-approved immunomodulatory agent, were evaluated in a rat model of moderate to severe TBI induced by controlled cortical impact. Post-TBI intravenous administration of Pom (0.5 mg/kg at 5 or 7 h and 0.1 mg/kg at 5 h) was evaluated on functional and histological measures that included motor function, fine more coordination, somatosensory function, lesion volume, cortical neurodegeneration, neuronal apoptosis, and the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6).--NEW SECTION--Pom 0.5 mg/kg administration at 5 h, but not at 7 h post-TBI, significantly mitigated the TBI-induced injury volume and functional impairments, neurodegeneration, neuronal apoptosis, and cytokine mRNA and protein induction. To evaluate underlying mechanisms, the actions of Pom on neuronal survival, microglial activation, and the induction of TNF-α were assessed in mixed cortical cultures following a glutamate challenge. Pom dose-dependently ameliorated glutamate-mediated cytotoxic effects on cell viability and reduced microglial cell activation, significantly attenuating the induction of TNF-α.--NEW SECTION--Post-injury treatment with a single Pom dose within 5 h significantly reduced functional impairments in a well-characterized animal model of TBI. Pom decreased the injury lesion volume, augmented neuronal survival, and provided anti-inflammatory properties.

All CRP patients were diagnosed by a combination of pelvic radiation history, clinical rectal bleeding, and endoscopic findings. Inclusion criteria were CRP patients with refractory bleeding with moderate to severe anemia with a hemoglobin level < 90 g/L. The study group included patients who were treated by diverting colostomy, while the control group included patients who received conservative treatment. The remission of bleeding was defined as complete cessation or only occasional bleeding that needed no further treatment. The primary outcome was bleeding remission at 6 mo after treatment. Quality of life before treatment and at follow-up was evaluated according to EORTC QLQ C30. Severe CRP complications were recorded during follow-up.--NEW SECTION--Forty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled, including 22 in the colostomy group and 27 in the conservative treatment group. When compared to conservative treatment, colostomy obtained a higher rate of bleeding remission (94% vs 12%), especially in control of transfusion-dependent bleeding (100% vs 0%), and offered a better control of refractory perianal pain (100% vs 0%), and a lower score of bleeding (P < 0.001) at 6 mo after treatment. At 1 year after treatment, colostomy achieved better remission of both moderate bleeding (100% vs 21.5%, P = 0.002) and severe bleeding (100% vs 0%, P < 0.001), obtained a lower score of bleeding (0.8 vs 2.0, P < 0.001), and achieved obvious elevated hemoglobin levels (P = 0.003), when compared to the conservative treatment group. The quality of life dramatically improved after colostomy, which included global health, function, and symptoms, but it was not improved in the control group.

However, the zoonotic origins of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic virus (pdmH1N1) remain unclear, due to conflicting evidence from swine and humans. There is strong evidence that the first human outbreak of pdmH1N1 occurred in Mexico in early 2009. However, no related swine viruses have been detected in Mexico or any part of the Americas, and to date the most closely related ancestor viruses were identified in Asian swine. Here, we use 58 new whole-genome sequences from IAVs collected in Mexican swine to establish that the swine virus responsible for the 2009 pandemic evolved in central Mexico. This finding highlights how the 2009 pandemic arose from a region not considered a pandemic risk, owing to an expansion of IAV diversity in swine resulting from long-distance live swine trade.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of skin sensitization to inhalant allergens in patients consulting for respiratory allergy, to identify the main allergens involved and to evaluate the profile of skin prick-test reactivity related to sex, age and season. This retrospective study included 379 patients consulting during 2009-2012 in three private medical offices of Tetouan. Of the 379 patients, 39.6% were monosensitized and 60.4% polysensitized. The percentages of polysensitized patients were higher in patients exhibiting rhinoconjunctivitis and astma-rhinoconjunctivitis than in subjects with asthma. The prevalence of symptoms according to sex showed no significant difference (P=0.64). Regarding age, a significant difference was observed in the case of rhinoconjunctivitis (P<0.01), while asthma and asthma-rhinoconjunctivitis showed no significant difference. Sensitization to house dust mites was the most frequent followed by grasses, olives and Parietaria. The multiple correspondence analyses (ACM) showed that patients under 20-years of age with asthma and asthma-rhinoconjunctivitis profile are more associated with sensitization to mites during the spring and autumn. The 20-49-year age group was represented mainly by polysensitized patients with rhinoconjunctivitis.

It has been suggested that enteric pathogen co-infections play an important role in gastroenteritis, but most research efforts have only focused on a small range of species belonging to a few pathogen groups. This study aimed to assess the impact of co-infections with a broad range of enteric pathogens on children aged below five years who suffer from acute diarrhea in southwest China.--NEW SECTION--A total of 1020 subjects (850 diarrhea cases and 170 healthy controls) were selected from four sentinel hospitals in Kunming, Yunnan province, southwest China, from June 2014 to July 2015. Stool specimens were collected to detect five virus (rotavirus group A, RVA; norovirus, NoV; Sapovirus, SaV; astrovirus, As; and adenovirus, Ad), seven bacterial (diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, DEC; non-typhoidal Salmonella, NTS; Shigella spp.; Vibrio cholera; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Aeromonas spp.; and Plesiomonas spp.), and three protozoan (Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia lamblia, and Blastocystis hominis, B. hominis) species using standard microbiologic and molecular methods. Data were analyzed using the partial least square regression technique and chi-square test.--NEW SECTION--At least one enteric pathogen was detected in 46.7 % (n = 397) of acute gastroenteritis cases and 13.5 % (n = 23) of healthy controls (χ(2) = 64.4, P < 0.05). Single infection with RVA was associated with acute diarrhea (26.5 % vs. 5.8 %, P < 0.05). The prevalence of a single infection with B. hominis in diarrhea cases was higher than in healthy controls (3.1 % vs. 0.5 %, OR = 4.7, 95 % CI: 1.01-112.0). Single infection with NoV GII was not associated with diarrhea (4.4 % vs. 3.5 %, OR = 1.2, 95 % CI: 0.5-3.3). Single infections with bacterial species were not observed. The prevalence of co-infections with two enteric pathogens in diarrhea cases was higher than in asymptomatic children (20.1 % vs. 5.3 %, P < 0.05). RVA-NoV GII was the most common co-infection in symptomatic children (4.4 %), with it aggravating the severity of diarrhea.--NEW SECTION--Although it is clear that RVA has an overwhelming impact on diarrhea illnesses in children, co-infection with other enteric pathogens appears to also aggravate diarrhea severity.

Most cases of HCC are secondary to viral hepatitis infection (hepatitis B or C), alcoholism and cirrhosis. Sorafenib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that suppresses tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, emerged as the first effective systemic treatment for HCC after 30 years of research, and is currently the standard-of-care for patients with advanced HCC. Sorafenib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450), particularly from the 3A4 isoform, producing two main metabolites: the N-oxide and the N-hydroxymethyl metabolite. We studied 11 HCC sample showing the presence of CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 in most of the samples analyzed. Specifically, the immunoreactivity of CYP3A4 was more strong and widespread than that of CYP3A7. The CYP3A4 immunoreactivity was observed in surrounding hepatocytes in 8 out of 11 cases; while the CYP3A7 immunostaining was found in normal liver cells, in 7 out of 11 cases. These results suggest the existence of a marked inter-individual variability regarding the presence of the isoforms of CYP3A. In addition, since sorafenib is metabolized by CYP3A4, but not by CYP3A7, an overexpression of CYP3A4 may lead to an increase in the degradation of the drug and then to clinical ineffectiveness. These results might implicate the necessity of an individualized approach in the treatment of HCC as positivity to CYP3A4 in HCC liver samples might predict a scarce response to sorafenib.",eng,European journal of histochemistry : EJH,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We previously showed that hippocampal injury during acute picornavirus infection in mice is associated with calpain activation and is the result of neuronal death triggered by brain-infiltrating inflammatory monocytes. We therefore hypothesized that treatment with a calpain inhibitor would protect neurons from immune-mediated bystander injury. C57BL/6J mice infected with the Daniel's strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus were treated with the FDA-approved drug ritonavir using a dosing regimen that resulted in plasma concentrations within the therapeutic range for calpain inhibition. Ritonavir treatment significantly reduced calpain activity in the hippocampus, protected hippocampal neurons from death, preserved cognitive performance, and suppressed seizure escalation, even when therapy was initiated 36 hours after disease onset.

27343545,10.1093/cid/ciw416,Impact of Opioid Substitution Therapy on Antiretroviral Therapy Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people who inject drugs (PWID) frequently encounter barriers accessing and remaining on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some studies have suggested that opioid substitution therapy (OST) could facilitate PWID's engagement with HIV services. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of concurrent OST use on ART-related outcomes among HIV-infected PWID.--NEW SECTION--We searched Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, Global Health, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Social Policy and Practice databases for studies between 1996 to November 2014 documenting the impact of OST, compared to no OST, on ART outcomes. Outcomes considered were coverage and recruitment onto ART, adherence, viral suppression, attrition from ART, and mortality. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects modeling, and heterogeneity assessed using Cochran Q test and I(2) statistic.--NEW SECTION--We identified 4685 articles, and 32 studies conducted in North America, Europe, Indonesia, and China were included. OST was associated with a 69% increase in recruitment onto ART (hazard ratio [HR], 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.15), a 54% increase in ART coverage (odds ratio [OR], 1.54; 95% CI, 1.17-2.03), a 2-fold increase in adherence (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.41-3.26), and a 23% decrease in the odds of attrition (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, .63-.95). OST was associated with a 45% increase in odds of viral suppression (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.21-1.73), but there was limited evidence from 6 studies for OST decreasing mortality for PWID on ART (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, .65-1.25).--NEW SECTION--These findings support the use of OST, and its integration with HIV services, to improve the HIV treatment and care continuum among HIV-infected PWID.",eng,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The conference brought together African leaders - including health and finance ministers, and parliamentarians thus creating a powerful platform for governments to demonstrate their commitment to advancing universal access to immunization on the continent in line with the Global Vaccine Action Plan. The event also brought together advocates, technical experts, policymakers, partner agencies, donors and journalists to examine how best to drive forward immunization across Africa, ensuring every child has access to the vaccines they need. Key points highlighted throughout conference were: universal access to immunization is at the forefront of enabling Africa to reach its full potential - by improving health, driving economic growth and empowering future generations; it is one of the most cost-effective solutions in global health, with clear benefits for health and development; and immunization brings economic benefits too, reducing health care costs and increasing productivity. At the close of the conference, 46 African countries signed a historic ministerial declaration on ""Universal Access to Immunization as a Cornerstone for Health and Development in Africa"" signaling fierce determination among African leaders to secure the health and prosperity of their societies through immunization.",eng,Vaccine,Congress,2025-04-23,2016

Patients had to complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 HRQoL questionnaire at baseline and at days 15, 30 and 60 after TACE.--NEW SECTION--Patients aged ≥18 years with HCC unsuitable for curative treatments were evaluated for the study (N=21).--NEW SECTION--The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of idarubicin loaded after a single TACE session. MTD was defined as the dose level closest to that causing dose-limiting toxicity in 20% of patients. HRQoL was the secondary end point.--NEW SECTION--Between March 2010 and March 2011, 9, 6 and 6 patients were included at idarubicin dose levels of 5, 10 and 15 mg, respectively. Calculated MTD of idarubicin was 10 mg. At the 10 mg idarubicin dose, patients presented a longer TTD than at 5 mg, for global health status (HR=0.91 (95% CI 0.18 to 4.72)), physical functioning (HR=0.38 (0.04 to 3.22)), fatigue (HR=0.67 (0.18 to 2.56)) and pain (HR=0.47 (0.05 to 4.24)).--NEW SECTION--These HRQoL results were consistent with the estimated MTD, with a median TTD for global health status of 41 days (21 to NA) at 5 mg, 23 days (20 to NA) at 10 mg and 25 days (17 to NA) at 15 mg.

27340833,10.1021/acsami.6b05840,Accelerated Blood Clearance Phenomenon Reduces the Passive Targeting of PEGylated Nanoparticles in Peripheral Arterial Disease.,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a leading global health concern. Due to limited imaging and therapeutic options, PAD and other ischemia-related diseases may benefit from the use of long circulating nanoparticles as imaging probes and/or drug delivery vehicles. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated nanoparticles have shown shortened circulation half-lives in vivo when injected multiple times into a single subject. This phenomenon has become known as the accelerated blood clearance (ABC) effect. The phenomenon is of concern for clinical translation of nanomaterials as it limits the passive accumulation of nanoparticles in many diseases, yet it has not been evaluated using inorganic or organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles. Herein, we found that the ABC phenomenon was induced by reinjection of PEGylated long circulating organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles, which significantly reduced the passive targeting of (64)Cu-labeled PEGylated reduced graphene oxide-iron oxide nanoparticles ((64)Cu-RGO-IONP-PEG) in a murine model of PAD. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was performed at 3, 10, and 17 days postsurgical induction of hindlimb ischemia. At day 3 postsurgery, the nanoparticles displayed a long circulation half-life with enhanced accumulation in the ischemic hindlimb. At days 10 and 17 postsurgery, reinjected mice displayed a short circulation half-life and lower accumulation of the nanoparticles in the ischemic hindlimb, in comparison to the naïve group. Also, reinjected mice showed significantly higher liver uptake than the naïve group, indicating that the nanoparticles experienced higher sequestration by the liver in the reinjected group. Furthermore, photoacoustic (PA) imaging and Prussian blue staining confirmed the enhanced accumulation of the nanoparticles in the liver tissue of reinjected mice. These findings validate the ABC phenomenon using long circulating organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles upon multiple administrations to the same animal, which may provide valuable insight into the future clinical applications of nanoparticles for imaging and treatment of PAD.",eng,ACS applied materials & interfaces,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This trend review seeks to assess and characterize the amount and type of scientific literature on the link between climate change and human health.--NEW SECTION--We tracked the use of climate-related terms and their co-occurrence with health terms during the 25 years since the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, from 1990 to 2014, in two scientific databases and in the IPCC reports. We investigated the trends in the number of publications about health and climate change through time, by nature of the health impact under study, and by geographic area. We compared the scientific production in the health field with that of other sectors on which climate change has an impact.--NEW SECTION--The number of publications was extremely low in both databases from 1990 (325 and 1,004, respectively) until around 2006 (1,332 and 4,319, respectively), which has since then increased exponentially in recent years (6,079 and 17,395, respectively, in 2014). However, the number of climate change papers regarding health is still about half that of other sectors. Certain health impacts, particularly malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), remain substantially understudied. Approximately two-thirds of all published studies were carried out in OECD countries (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), predominantly in Europe and North America.--NEW SECTION--There is a clear need for further research on the links between climate change and health. This pertains particularly to research in and by those countries in which health will be mostly affected and capacity to adapt is least. Specific undertreated topics such as NCDs, malnutrition, and mental health should gain the priority they deserve. Funding agencies are invited to take note of and establish calls for proposals accordingly.

First, policy decisions should be based on a sound evidence base regarding health risks and burdens to health systems, rather than prejudice or unfounded fears. Second, for incoming refugees, we must focus on building inclusive, cost-effective health services to promote collective health security.

Perhaps, a common cause of trauma-related mortality in these settings comes from the rapid expansion of motor vehicle ownership without the corresponding expansion of national prehospital training in developed countries. The resulting road traffic injuries often never make it to the hospital in time for effective treatment, resulting in preventable disability and death. The current article examines the development of a medical first responder training program that has the potential to reduce this unnecessary morbidity and mortality.--NEW SECTION--An intensive training workshop has been differentiated into two progressive tiers: acute trauma training (ATT) and broad trauma training (BTT) protocols. These four-hour and two-day protocols, respectively, allow for the mass education of laypersons-such as police officials, fire brigade, and taxi and/or ambulance drivers-who are most likely to interact first with prehospital victims. Over 750 ATT participants and 168 BTT participants were trained across three Indian educational institutions at Jodhpur and Jaipur. Trainees were given didactic and hands-on education in a series of critical trauma topics, in addition to pretraining and post-training self-assessments to rate clinical confidence across curricular topics. Two-sample t-test statistical analyses were performed to compare pretraining and post-training confidence levels.--NEW SECTION--Program development resulted in recruitment of a variety of career backgrounds for enrollment in both our ATT and BTT workshops. The workshops were run by local physicians from a wide spectrum of medical specialties and previously ATT-trained police officials. Statistically significant improvements in clinical confidence across all curricular topics for ATT and BTT protocols were identified (P < 0.0001). In addition, improvement in confidence after BTT training was similar in Jodhpur compared with Jaipur.--NEW SECTION--These results suggest a promising level of reliability and reproducibility across different geographic areas in rapidly developing settings. Program expansion can offer an exponential growth in the training rate of medical first responders, which can help curb the trauma-related mortality in rapidly developing economies. Future directions will include clinical competency assessments and further progressive differentiation into higher tiers of trauma expertise.",eng,The Journal of surgical research,Clinical Trial,2025-04-23,2016

The timeline of B. dendrobatidis's global emergence still remains a mystery, as does its point of origin. The reason why B. dendrobatidis seems to have only recently increased in virulence to catalyze this global disease event remains unknown, and despite 15 years of investigation, this wildlife pandemic continues primarily uncontrolled.

Physical inactivity is a large contributor to this problem; in fact, the WHO ranks it as the fourth leading risk factor for overall morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Canada, at least 4 of 5 adults do not meet the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines of 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. Physicians play an important role in the dissemination of physical activity (PA) recommendations to a broad segment of the population, as over 80% of Canadians visit their doctors every year and prefer to get health information directly from them. Unfortunately, most physicians do not regularly assess or prescribe PA as part of routine care, and even when discussed, few provide specific recommendations. PA prescription has the potential to be an important therapeutic agent for all ages in primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of chronic disease. Sport and exercise medicine (SEM) physicians are particularly well suited for this role and should collaborate with their primary care colleagues for optimal patient care. The purpose of this Canadian Academy and Sport and Exercise Medicine position statement is to provide an evidence-based, best practices summary to better equip SEM and primary care physicians to prescribe PA and exercise, specifically for the prevention and management of non-communicable disease.

Burden of emergency conditions was the highest in low-income countries, with median DALYs of 47 728 per 100 000 population (IQR 45 253-50 085) in low-income, 25 186 (IQR 21 982-40 480) in middle-income and 15 691 (IQR 14 649-16 382) in high-income countries. Patterns were similar using deaths to measure burden and excluding acute decompensations from the definition of emergency conditions. Conversely, emergency usage rates were the lowest in low-income countries, with median 8 visits per 1000 population (IQR 6-10), 78 (IQR 25-197) in middle-income and 264 (IQR 177-341) in high-income countries.--NEW SECTION--Despite higher burden of emergency conditions, emergency usage rates are substantially lower in LMICs, likely due to limited access to emergency care.",eng,Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27334606,10.1186/s12916-016-0640-4,Beyond viral suppression of HIV - the new quality of life frontier.,"In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted a new Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV for 2016-2021. It establishes 15 ambitious targets, including the '90-90-90' target calling on health systems to reduce under-diagnosis of HIV, treat a greater number of those diagnosed, and ensure that those being treated achieve viral suppression.--NEW SECTION--The WHO strategy calls for person-centered chronic care for people living with HIV (PLHIV), implicitly acknowledging that viral suppression is not the ultimate goal of treatment. However, it stops short of providing an explicit target for health-related quality of life. It thus fails to take into account the needs of PLHIV who have achieved viral suppression but still must contend with other intense challenges such as serious non-communicable diseases, depression, anxiety, financial stress, and experiences of or apprehension about HIV-related discrimination. We propose adding a 'fourth 90' to the testing and treatment target: ensure that 90 % of people with viral load suppression have good health-related quality of life. The new target would expand the continuum-of-services paradigm beyond the existing endpoint of viral suppression. Good health-related quality of life for PLHIV entails attention to two domains: comorbidities and self-perceived quality of life.--NEW SECTION--Health systems everywhere need to become more integrated and more people-centered to successfully meet the needs of virally suppressed PLHIV. By doing so, these systems can better meet the needs of all of their constituents - regardless of HIV status - in an era when many populations worldwide are living much longer with multiple comorbidities.",eng,BMC medicine,Editorial,2025-04-23,2016
27334057,10.1038/hr.2016.68,Estimation methods for human circadian phase by use of peripheral tissues.,"Almost all living organisms, including humans, exhibit diurnal rhythms of physiology and behavior, which are driven by the circadian clock. Many studies have found that chronic misalignment between circadian and environmental/social rhythms carries a significant risk of various disorders, including sleep disorders, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However, irregular sleep-wake cycles and circadian maladjustment often cause 'social jet lag', which is minor but chronic jet-lag in our daily lives. Establishment of objective and convenient circadian-phase estimation methods in the clinical setting would therefore greatly contribute not only to resolving this global health problem but also to developing chronomedicine, a clinical approach for optimizing the time of day of treatments. Traditional melatonin-based methods have limitations with respect to circadian-phase evaluation; however, estimation methods based on clock gene expression may be able to compensate for these limitations. As a representative application of circadian-phase estimation based on clock gene expression, our method of using hair follicle cells may aid in the rapid clinical detection of circadian-related sleep problems, especially circadian rhythm sleep disorders that are masked because of forced adaptation to social time schedules.",eng,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

30202302,10.1177/1559827614554186,Lifestyle Approaches and Glucose Intolerance.,"Glucose intolerance is a global health concern that encompasses glucose metabolism abnormalities such as impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). There is an urgent need to focus on the prediabetes (ie, IGT and IFG) stage before the disease actually occurs. The progression from IGT to T2D can be prevented or delayed by modifying the lifestyles in high-risk individuals, and these health benefits are well documented in various ethnicities with prediabetes across the world. Specifically, consuming a healthy diet (high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, fiber, and whole grains), losing weight, quitting smoking, consuming alcohol in moderation, and increasing physical activity can improve glucose tolerance and reduce the risk of T2D. Also, pharmacological agents and botanicals can be used to manage glucose intolerance if the implementation of lifestyle changes is challenging. Pharmacological treatments have been successful in managing glucose intolerance; however, they have adverse effects. Also, more research on botanicals is warranted before a definitive recommendation can be made for their use in managing glucose intolerance. To make progress on this worldwide problem, efforts are needed to improve the awareness of prediabetes, increase promotion of healthy behaviors, and improve the availability of evidence-based lifestyle intervention programs to the community.",eng,American journal of lifestyle medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Hurdles include fear of contracting and importing the disease, residency requirements, scheduling conflicts, family obligations and lack of experience and maturity. We describe the successful four-week deployment to Liberia of a first year infectious diseases trainee through the mechanism of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network of the World Health Organization. The posting received prospective approval from the residency supervisory committees and employing hospital management and was designed with components fulfilling the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies. It mirrored conventional training with regards to learning objectives, supervisory framework and assessment methods. Together with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and many other partners, the team joined the infection prevention and control efforts in Monrovia. Contributions were made to a 'ring fencing' infection control approach that was being introduced, including enhancement of triage, training and providing supplies in high priority health-care facilities in the capital and border zones. In addition the fellow produced an electronic database that enabled monitoring infection control standards in health facilities. This successful elective posting illustrates that quality training can be achieved, even in the most challenging environments, with support from the pedagogic and sponsoring institutions. Such experiential learning opportunities benefit both the outbreak response and the trainee, and if scaled up would contribute towards building a global health emergency workforce.

E138K in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a primary mutation in resistance to rilpivirine, although in vitro experiments showed it confers only <3-fold resistance. An unidentified mechanism could amplify resistance to rilpivirine conferred by E138K.--NEW SECTION--The objective of this study was to reveal the mechanism amplifying rilpivirine resistance conferred by E138K.--NEW SECTION--HIV-1 RT sequences were compared in patients who failed rilpivirine-containing ART virologically. The effects of mutations commonly identified with E138K on rilpivirine susceptibility were analysed by using recombinant HIV-1 variants.--NEW SECTION--Rilpivirine-containing ART was introduced in 162 HIV-1-infected patients at the outpatient clinic of the AIDS Clinical Center (National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan) between May 2012 and June 2015. Virological treatment failure occurred in six of these patients. E138K emerged in three patients while other rilpivirine resistance mutations emerged in the other three patients. I135T/L were identified in only three patients with E138K and existed before the introduction of rilpivirine-containing ART. Analysis of recombinant HIV-1 variants indicated that E138K conferred low-level rilpivirine resistance and that coexistence of I135T/L with E138K amplified the resistance.--NEW SECTION--I135T/L, escape mutations from HLA-B*51/52-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are prevalent in Japan, may predispose HIV-1 to harbour E138K upon failure of rilpivirine-containing ART.

27329381,10.1007/s11096-016-0330-5,A web-based training program to support chronic kidney disease screening by community pharmacists.,"Background Community pharmacists' role in screening of several chronic diseases has been widely explored. The global health burden of chronic kidney disease is high; however, the progression and adverse outcomes can be prevented or delayed by detecting and treating the disease in its initial stages 1-3. Therefore, a web-based training program was developed to enhance pharmacists' knowledge and skills required to perform a chronic kidney disease screening service in a community setting. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a web-based training program on community pharmacists' knowledge and skills associated with chronic kidney disease screening. As secondary aim, pharmacists' satisfaction with the training program was assessed. Setting Community pharmacy practice. Method A web-based training program was developed by four pharmacists and a nephrologist. Quantitative data was collected by employing a self-administered, web-based questionnaire, which comprised a set of five multiple-choice knowledge questions and one clinical vignette to assess skills. A nine-item Likert scale was used to determine pharmacists' satisfaction with the training program. Main outcome measure Pharmacists' knowledge and skills scores at pre and post-training, reliability of the Likert scale, and the proportion of responses to the individual nine items of the satisfaction survey. Results Fifty pharmacists participated in the pre-questionnaire and 38 pharmacists completed the web-based training and post-questionnaire. Significant differences were observed in the knowledge scores (p < 0.001) and skills scores (p < 0.001) at pre- and post-training. Cronbach's alpha for the nine-item satisfaction scale was 0.73 and the majority pharmacists (92.1-100 %) were satisfied with the various aspects of the training program. Conclusion The web-based training program positively enhanced pharmacists' knowledge and skills associated with chronic kidney disease screening.

27323919,10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00684-X,Global health burden and needs of transgender populations: a review.,"Transgender people are a diverse population affected by a range of negative health indicators across high-income, middle-income, and low-income settings. Studies consistently document a high prevalence of adverse health outcomes in this population, including HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, mental health distress, and substance use and abuse. However, many other health areas remain understudied, population-based representative samples and longitudinal studies are few, and routine surveillance efforts for transgender population health are scarce. The absence of survey items with which to identify transgender respondents in general surveys often restricts the availability of data with which to estimate the magnitude of health inequities and characterise the population-level health of transgender people globally. Despite the limitations, there are sufficient data highlighting the unique biological, behavioural, social, and structural contextual factors surrounding health risks and resiliencies for transgender people. To mitigate these risks and foster resilience, a comprehensive approach is needed that includes gender affirmation as a public health framework, improved health systems and access to health care informed by high quality data, and effective partnerships with local transgender communities to ensure responsiveness of and cultural specificity in programming. Consideration of transgender health underscores the need to explicitly consider sex and gender pathways in epidemiological research and public health surveillance more broadly.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Patients were recruited from a large tertiary hospital within the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia. All eligible participants answered a three-part questionnaire that included demographic data and the validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL) and (EORTC IN-PATSAT32) questionnaires.--NEW SECTION--Participants were mostly female (103/130, 79%) and married (93/130, 71%), and more than half had breast cancer (69/130, 53%). They were between 17 and 86 years of age (mean = 46.7, SD = 16.50). The correlation test showed that the relationship with physical function was weak, while emotional function and global health status had a moderate relationship with general satisfaction (r = 0.21, p < 0.01; r = 0.32, p < 0.001; r = 0.26, p < 0.01, respectively). Our results suggest that emotional function is the more important factor in predicting satisfaction with care among palliative cancer patients. An increase in emotional function leads to increased general satisfaction.--NEW SECTION--The emotional function of palliative cancer patients was more closely associated with overall satisfaction with care than physical function or global health status. All palliative care team members are thus required to provide adequate psychosocial support. It is recommended that interdisciplinary and collaborative approaches be integrated in palliative care of cancer patients.",eng,Palliative & supportive care,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Over the past few decades new zoonotic infectious diseases of humans caused by pathogens arising from animal reservoirs have included West Nile virus, Yellow fever virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Lassa Fever virus, Hanta virus, Dengue fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, and Zika virus. The recent Ebola Virus Disease epidemic in West Africa and the ongoing Zika Virus outbreak in South America highlight the urgent need for local, regional and international public health systems to be be more coordinated and better prepared. The One Health concept focuses on the relationship and interconnectedness between Humans, Animals and the Environment, and recognizes that the health and wellbeing of humans is intimately connected to the health of animals and their environment (and vice versa). Critical to the establishment of a One Health platform is the creation of a multidisciplinary team with a range of expertise including public health officers, physicians, veterinarians, animal husbandry specialists, agriculturalists, ecologists, vector biologists, viral phylogeneticists, and researchers to co-operate, collaborate to learn more about zoonotic spread between animals, humans and the environment and to monitor, respond to and prevent major outbreaks. We discuss the unique opportunities for Middle Eastern and African stakeholders to take leadership in building equitable and effective partnerships with all stakeholders involved in human and health systems to take forward a 'One Health' approach to control such zoonotic pathogens with epidemic potential.",eng,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,Editorial,2025-04-23,2016

We investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI), depression, and their association with HRQoL in patients with intra- (IA) and extraaxial (EA) tumors during the first 9 months after diagnosis.--NEW SECTION--Patients were recruited immediately following surgery, and re-evaluated after 3, 6, and 9 months (EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Appendix). Patients with a personal history of psychological comorbidity were excluded. Sociodemographic and clinical data were evaluated.--NEW SECTION--IA patients had lower functioning scores and experienced more symptoms. Global Health Status was significantly lower at baseline (p = 0.038), but improved over time (p < 0.001). Seventeen patients (21.5 %) admitted to having had SI at least once during the study period (IA: n = 10/EA: n = 7). The highest rates were observed after 6 (IA: 18.8 %) and 9 months (EA: 10.0 %). Patients reporting SI had significantly higher BDI scores [p = 0.22 (baseline), p = 0.031 (3 months), p < 0.001 (6 months)]. After 6 months, HRQoL differed greatest between patients with and without SI. Most patients experienced good familial support (76 %).--NEW SECTION--Patients with intracranial tumors suffer from decreased HRQoL and SI regardless of histopathology. SI is associated with higher BDI scores, but not evident depression (BDI ≥ 18). Thus, patients should be screened specifically and regularly. Lower HRQoL and greatest prevalence of SI at 6 months may help clinicians to find the right time for careful monitoring of patients at risk.",eng,Acta neurochirurgica,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

It is widely accepted that an effective vaccine against RSV would have a major impact on child health globally. Despite the setbacks of the clinical trials in the 1960s, there has been a recent and significant revival of interest in vaccines against RSV, with several promising candidates undergoing evaluation. In this Review, we describe the epidemiological and immunological background to RSV infection and subsequently focus on the promising pipeline of RSV vaccine development. We discuss the potential for implementation of a safe and immunogenic RSV vaccine within the context of global health and with regards to a range of strategies, including vaccination of women during pregnancy, which is likely to emerge as a beneficial and feasible public health tool. This approach would provide interim protection to vulnerable, RSV-naive infants and other high risk groups, in which the burden of admission to hospital and death is greatest. Extending research and implementation from resource-rich to resource-poor settings is required to enhance our understanding of RSV immunity and inform vaccine development and delivery strategies for all settings. We summarise key outstanding issues for researchers and policy makers to understand the interplay of biological and non-biological factors affecting design and distribution of a successful RSV vaccine globally.",eng,The Lancet.

We sought to estimate the frequencies of (a) skilled birth attendant coverage, (b) institutional delivery, and (c) the combination of place of delivery and type of attendant, in LMICs.--NEW SECTION--National surveys (DHS and MICS) performed in 80 LMICs since 2005 were analyzed to estimate these four categories of delivery care. Results were stratified by wealth quintile based on asset indices, and by urban/rural residence. The combination of place of delivery and type of attendant were also calculated for seven world regions.--NEW SECTION--The proportion of institutional SBA deliveries was above 90 % in 25 of the 80 countries, and below 40 % in 11 countries. A strong positive correlation between SBA and institutional delivery coverage (rho: 0.97, p <0,001) was observed. Eight countries had over 10 % of home SBA deliveries, and two countries had over 10 % of institutional non-SBA deliveries. Except for South Asia, all regions had over 80 % of urban deliveries in the institutional SBA category, but in rural areas, only two regions (CEE & CIS, Middle East & North Africa) presented average coverage above 80 %. In all regions, institutional SBA deliveries were over 80 % in the richest quintile. Home SBA deliveries were more common in rural than in urban areas, and in the poorest quintiles in all regions. Facility non-SBA deliveries also tended to be more common in rural areas and among the poorest.--NEW SECTION--Four different categories of delivery assistance were identified worldwide.

We assessed the association of mannose binding lectin (MBL) deficiency and vertical transmission of HIV. Novel diagnostics would be a major breakthrough in this regard. MBL is a liver-derived protein and a key component of the innate immune system. MBL levels may be classified as normal, intermediate, or deficient in the plasma and can use MBL2 haplotypes as a proxy. These haplotypes comprise polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene and promoter region and are known to result in varying levels of MBL deficiency. MBL deficiency can be defined as presence of A/O and O/O genotypes in the mothers and their children. MBL deficiency leads to defective opsonization activities of the innate immune system and increased susceptibility to several infections, including HIV-1. We determined the prevalence of MBL deficiency, using MBL2 haplotypes among 622 HIV-positive Zimbabwean mothers and their children aged 9-18 months old, in relation to the HIV-1 vertical transmission risk. The median age of the mothers was 30 (26-34, interquartile range [IQR]) years, and the babies' median age was 13 (11-15, IQR) months old at the time of enrollment. From the sample of 622 mothers who were HIV-1 infected, 574 babies were HIV negative and 48 were HIV-1-positive babies, giving a transmission rate of 7.7%. MBL2 normal structural allele A and variants B (codon 5 A>G), C (codon 57 A>G), and promoter region SNPs -550(H/L) and -221(X/Y) were detected. Prevalence of haplotype-predicted MBL deficiency was 34% among the mothers and 32% among the children. We found no association between maternal MBL2 deficiency and HIV-1 transmission to their children. We found no difference in the distribution of HIV-1 infected and uninfected children between the MBL2 genotypes of the mothers and those of the children. Taken together, the present study in a large sample of mother-infant pairs in Zimbabwe adds to the emerging literature and the hypothesis that MBL2 variation as predicted by haplotypes does not influence the vertical transmission risk for HIV. Research from other populations from the African continent is called for to test this hypothesis further.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The acceleration of global travel and trade poses greater opportunities for infectious diseases to emerge and spread. The International Health Regulations (IHR) were adopted in 2005 with the intent of proactively developing public health systems that could react to the spread of infectious disease and provide better containment. Various challenges delayed adherence to the IHR. The Global Health Security Agenda came about as an international collaborative effort, working multilaterally among governments and across sectors, seeking to implement the IHR and develop the capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies of international concern. When examining the recent West African Ebola epidemic as a case study for global health security, both strengths and weaknesses in the public health response are evident. The central role of public health surveillance is a lesson reiterated by Ebola. Through further implementation of the Global Health Security Agenda, identified gaps in surveillance can be filled and global health security strengthened.",eng,Health security,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

As dietary-associated risk is the most important behavioral factor influencing global health, it appears the best target in the challenge against CVD. Although for many years, since the formulation of the cholesterol hypothesis, a nutrient-based approach was attempted for CVD prevention and treatment, in recent years a dietary-based approach resulted more effective in reducing cardiovascular risk worldwide. After the publication of randomized trials on the remarkable effects of the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on CVD, new efforts were put on research about the effects of complex dietary interventions on CVD.

Diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease are also on the increase, and both are associated with accelerated vascular calcification and an unfavorable prognosis in PAD. These data challenge the traditional athero-centric view of PAD, instead pointing toward a disease process complicated by medial arterial calcification. Like atherosclerosis, aging is a potent risk factor for medial arterial calcification, and accelerated vascular aging may underpin the devastating manifestations of PAD, particularly in patients prone to calcification. Consequently, this review will attempt to dissect the relationship between medial arterial calcification and atherosclerosis in PAD and identify common as well as novel risk factors that may contribute to and accelerate progression of PAD. In this context, we focus on the complex interplay between oxidative stress, DNA damage, and vascular aging, as well as the unexplored role of neuropathy.",eng,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Multidrug-Resistant Escherichia coli Proteomes from Slaughtered Pigs.,"Understanding global drug resistance demands an integrated vision, focusing on both human and veterinary medicine. Omics technologies offer new vistas to decipher mechanisms of drug resistance in the food chain. For example, Escherichia coli resistance to major antibiotics is increasing whereas multidrug resistance (MDR) strains are now commonly found in humans and animals. Little is known about the structural and metabolic changes in the cell that trigger resistance to antimicrobial agents. Proteomics is an emerging field that is used to advance our knowledge in global health and drug resistance in the food chain. In the present proteomic analysis, we offer an overview of the global protein expression of different MDR E. coli strains from fecal samples of pigs slaughtered for human consumption. A full proteomic survey of the drug-resistant strains SU60, SU62, SU76, and SU23, under normal growth conditions, was made by two-dimensional electrophoresis, identifying proteins by MALDI-TOF/MS. The proteomes of these four E. coli strains with different genetic profiles were compared in detail. Identical transport, stress response, or metabolic proteins were discovered in the four strains. Several of the identified proteins are essential in bacterial pathogenesis (GAPDH, LuxS, FKBPs), development of bacterial resistance (Omp's, TolC, GroEL, ClpB, or SOD), and potential antibacterial targets (FBPA, FabB, ACC's, or Fab1). Effective therapies against resistant bacteria are crucial and, to accomplish this, a comprehensive understanding of putative resistance mechanisms is essential. Moving forward, we suggest that multi-omics research will further improve our knowledge about bacterial growth and virulence on the food chain, especially under antibiotic stress.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Worrisomely, we lack robust diagnostics of RA and its remission status. Research with the next-generation biomarker technology platforms such as glycomics offers new promises in this context. We report here a clinical case-control study comprising 128 patients suffering from chronic RA (80.22% in remission, 19.78% active clinically) and 195 gender- and age-matched controls, with a view to the putative glycan biomarkers of RA as well as its activity or remission status in Han Chinese RA patients. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-ultra-performance liquid chromatography (HILIC-UPLC) was used for the analysis of IgG glycans. The regression model identified the glycans that predict RA status, while a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis validated the sensitivity and prediction power. Among the total 24 glycan peaks (GP1-GP24), ROC analysis showed only GP1 prediction to be highly sensitive with an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.881. Even though GP21 and GP22 could predict active status among the RA cases (p < 0.05), they had lower sensitivity of prediction with an AUC = 0.658. Taken together, these observations suggest that GP1 might have potential as a putative biomarker for RA in the Han Chinese population, while the change in IgG glycosylation shows association with the RA active and remission states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first glycomics study with respect to disease activity and remission states in RA.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Here we aimed to determine whether time to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) score definitive deterioration (TUDD) differs by study arm.--NEW SECTION--HRQoL was evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 at baseline and every 4 cycles until the end of the study or death. Functional scale, symptom scale, global health status, and financial difficulties were analyzed. The TUDD was defined as the time interval between randomization and the first decrease in HRQoL score ≥ 5-point with no further improvement in HRQoL score ≥ 5 points or any further HRQoL data. TUDD was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the long-rank test. Cox regression analyses were used to identify HRQoL items influencing TUDD. Sensitivity analyses were done using a multiple imputation method and different definitions of TUDD.--NEW SECTION--Of the 284 patients, 171 (60.2%) completed HRQoL questionnaires. Cox multivariate analysis showed no statistically significant difference in TUDD for most of the QLQ-C30 scales between treatments. Patients with dyspnea and those without symptoms at baseline had a significantly longer TUDD when there was a delay >12 months between diagnosis of the primary tumor and metastases (HR 0.48 [0.26-0.89]) and when there was diarrhea (HR 0.59 [0.36-0.96]), respectively.--NEW SECTION--This study shows that TUDD does not differ significantly according to type of treatment.

It has heavily utilised global health ideology to construct promotional messages that rely on neoliberal models of individual, responsible health citizenship. However, after nearly 30 years of public health messaging, there have been only minor shifts in the country's HIV prevalence rates; it has become apparent that there is disconnect between policy, programmes, and target audiences. Debates about where this disconnect occurs tend to focus on the role of problems in biomedical knowledge translation or with structural inequalities that lead to health inequity. As debates increase, artists involved in health have emerged to address an additional reason: audience interpellation. In this article, I interrogate relationships between health promotion ideology and processes of interpellation. I suggest that disconnect between the two has roots in the tone of programming, the ways sociality is constructed within health promotion, and the kind of subject which global prevention programmes seek to constitute. Using a case study, I illustrate how public health ideology is made actionable through arts practice. While conventional health promotion programmes address populations in a way that allows individuals to distance themselves, members of South Africa's arts sector have worked to integrate prevention and care in a way that bolsters interpellation through making messages personal. The case study presents one performance but is informed by my broader research with over 20 theatrical groups conducted during 18 months of fieldwork. Analysis of the production reveals that artists act as mediators between population-level public health messages and individuals through the embodied technologies of applied theatre. However, I argue that artists also create space for participants to reimagine configurations of care, responsibility, and intimacy within health practices.",eng,AIDS care,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Promoting universal health coverage (UHC) will help prevent another disease outbreak similar to the recent Ebola outbreak in west Africa, and create robust health systems, capable of withstanding future shocks. Robust health systems, in turn, are the prerequisites for achieving UHC. We propose three areas for global health action by the G7 countries at their meeting in Japan in May, 2016, to protect human security around the world: restructuring of the global health architecture so that it enables preparedness and responses to health emergencies; development of platforms to share best practices and harness shared learning about the resilience and sustainability of health systems; and strengthening of coordination and financing for research and development and system innovations for global health security. Rather than creating new funding or organisations, global leaders should reorganise current financing structures and institutions so that they work more effectively and efficiently. By making smart investments, countries will improve their capacity to monitor, track, review, and assess health system performance and accountability, and thereby be better prepared for future global health shocks.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for chronic pain is often limited, and there is growing concern about the adverse effects of these treatments, including opioid dependence. Nonpharmacological approaches to chronic pain may be an attractive alternative or adjunctive treatment. We describe the effectiveness of a novel, theoretically based group pain management support intervention for chronic musculoskeletal pain.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a multi-centre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (cost-utility) trial across 27 general practices and community musculoskeletal services in the UK. We recruited 703 adults with musculoskeletal pain of at least 3 mo duration between August 1, 2011, and July 31, 2012, and randomised participants 1.33:1 to intervention (403) or control (300). Intervention participants were offered a participative group intervention (COPERS) delivered over three alternate days with a follow-up session at 2 wk. The intervention introduced cognitive behavioural approaches and was designed to promote self-efficacy to manage chronic pain. Controls received usual care and a relaxation CD. The primary outcome was pain-related disability at 12 mo (Chronic Pain Grade [CPG] disability subscale); secondary outcomes included the CPG disability subscale at 6 mo and the following measured at 6 and 12 mo: anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), pain acceptance (Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire), social integration (Health Education Impact Questionnaire social integration and support subscale), pain-related self-efficacy (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire), pain intensity (CPG pain intensity subscale), the census global health question (2011 census for England and Wales), health utility (EQ-5D-3L), and health care resource use. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle, accounted for clustering by course in the intervention arm, and used multiple imputation for missing or incomplete primary outcome data. The mean age of participants was 59.9 y, with 81% white, 67% female, 23% employed, 85% with pain for at least 3 y, and 23% on strong opioids. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were common (baseline mean HADS scores 7.4 [standard deviation 4.1] and 9.2 [4.6], respectively). Overall, 282 (70%) intervention participants met the predefined intervention adherence criterion. Primary outcome data were obtained from 88% of participants. There was no significant difference between groups in pain-related disability at 6 or 12 mo (12 mo: difference -1.0, intervention versus control, 95% CI -4.9 to 3.0), pain intensity, or the census global health question. Anxiety, depression, pain-related self-efficacy, pain acceptance, and social integration were better in the intervention group at 6 mo; at 12 mo, these differences remained statistically significant only for depression (-0.7, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.2) and social integration (0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.2). Intervention participants received more analgesics than the controls across the 12 mo. The total cost of the course per person was £145 (US$214). The cost-utility analysis showed there to be a small benefit in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.0325, 95% CI -0.0074 to 0.0724), and on the cost side the intervention was a little more expensive than usual care (i.e., £188 [US$277], 95% CI -£125 [-US$184] to £501 [US$738]), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £5,786 (US$8,521) per QALY. Limitations include the fact that the intervention was relatively brief and did not include any physical activity components.--NEW SECTION--While the COPERS intervention was brief, safe, and inexpensive, with a low attrition rate, it was not effective for reducing pain-related disability over 12 mo (primary outcome). For secondary outcomes, we found sustained benefits on depression and social integration at 6 and 12 mo, but there was no effect on anxiety, pain-related self-efficacy, pain acceptance, pain intensity, or the census global health question at 12 mo. There was some evidence that the intervention may be cost-effective based on a modest difference in QALYs between groups.--NEW SECTION--ISRCTN Registry 24426731.",eng,PLoS medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Being able to identify the genetic mechanisms of AMR and predict the resistance phenotypes of bacterial pathogens prior to culturing could inform clinical decision-making and improve reaction time. At PATRIC (http://patricbrc.org/), we have been collecting bacterial genomes with AMR metadata for several years. In order to advance phenotype prediction and the identification of genomic regions relating to AMR, we have updated the PATRIC FTP server to enable access to genomes that are binned by their AMR phenotypes, as well as metadata including minimum inhibitory concentrations. Using this infrastructure, we custom built AdaBoost (adaptive boosting) machine learning classifiers for identifying carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-lactam and co-trimoxazole resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae with accuracies ranging from 88-99%. We also did this for isoniazid, kanamycin, ofloxacin, rifampicin, and streptomycin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, achieving accuracies ranging from 71-88%.

27297348,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.008731,Endemic Cardiovascular Diseases of the Poorest Billion.,"The poorest billion people are distributed throughout the world, though most are concentrated in rural sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) data can be sparse in low- and middle-income countries beyond urban centers. Despite this urban bias, CVD registries from the poorest countries have long revealed a predominance of nonatherosclerotic stroke, hypertensive heart disease, nonischemic and Chagas cardiomyopathies, rheumatic heart disease, and congenital heart anomalies, among others. Ischemic heart disease has been relatively uncommon. Here, we summarize what is known about the epidemiology of CVDs among the world's poorest people and evaluate the relevance of global targets for CVD control in this population. We assessed both primary data sources, and the 2013 Global Burden of Disease Study modeled estimates in the world's 16 poorest countries where 62% of the population are among the poorest billion. We found that ischemic heart disease accounted for only 12% of the combined CVD and congenital heart anomaly disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the poorest countries, compared with 51% of DALYs in high-income countries. We found that as little as 53% of the combined CVD and congenital heart anomaly burden (1629/3049 DALYs per 100 000) was attributed to behavioral or metabolic risk factors in the poorest countries (eg, in Niger, 82% of the population among the poorest billion) compared with 85% of the combined CVD and congenital heart anomaly burden (4439/5199 DALYs) in high-income countries. Further, of the combined CVD and congenital heart anomaly burden, 34% was accrued in people under age 30 years in the poorest countries, while only 3% is accrued under age 30 years in high-income countries. We conclude although the current global targets for noncommunicable disease and CVD control will help diminish premature CVD death in the poorest populations, they are not sufficient. Specifically, the current framework (1) excludes deaths of people <30 years of age and deaths attributable to congenital heart anomalies, and (2) emphasizes interventions to prevent and treat conditions attributed to behavioral and metabolic risks factors. We recommend a complementary strategy for the poorest populations that targets premature death at younger ages, addresses environmental and infectious risks, and introduces broader integrated health system interventions, including cardiac surgery for congenital and rheumatic heart disease.",eng,Circulation,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the percentage of children and adults with tuberculosis that are sputum smear positive.--NEW SECTION--We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health databases for studies that included both children and adults with all forms of active TB. The pooled percentages of children and adults with smear positive TB were estimated using the inverse variance heterogeneity model.

Moreover, non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae strains are emerging as a major global health concern by causing severe pharyngitis and tonsillitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Molecular epidemiological investigations suggest the existence of outbreak-associated clones with multiple genotypes circulating around the world. Evolution and pathogenesis appears to be driven by recombination as major virulence factors, including the tox gene and pilus gene clusters, are found within genomic islands that appear to be mobile between strains. The number of pilus gene clusters and variation introduced by gain or loss of gene function correlate with the variable adhesive and invasive properties of C. diphtheriae strains. Genomic variation does not support the separation of C. diphtheriae strains into biovars which correlates well with findings of studies based on multilocus sequence typing. Genomic analyses of a relatively small number of strains also revealed a recombination driven diversification of strains within a sequence type and indicate a wider diversity among C. diphtheriae strains than previously appreciated. This suggests that there is a need for increased effort from the scientific community to study C. diphtheriae to help understand the genomic diversity and pathogenicity within the population of this important human pathogen.",eng,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Direct and blinded assessments of height and weight were used to calculate body mass index z-score and to identify overweight/obesity. Parents reported on child global health, sleep problems and physical injuries. Unadjusted and adjusted (socio-demographic factors and co-morbidities) logistic and linear regression were conducted to compare health-related impairments between (1) children with and without ADHD; (2) boys and girls with ADHD; (3) children with ADHD-inattentive and ADHD-combined types; and (4) children with ADHD by internalizing and externalizing disorder status.--NEW SECTION--Children with ADHD had poorer global health than controls when adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics (OR: 2.0; 95% CI 1.1, 3.9); however, this attenuated after adjusting for co-morbidities. In adjusted analyses, children with ADHD had increased odds of moderate/large sleep problems (OR: 3.1; 95% CI 1.4, 6.8), compared with controls. There were no differences between children with and without ADHD in terms of physical injuries or overweight/obesity. Findings were similar when excluding children taking ADHD medication, and health-related impairments did not differ between boys and girls with ADHD. Children with ADHD-combined type had higher BMI z-scores than controls in adjusted analyses (P = 0.04). Children with ADHD and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing co-morbidities were particularly vulnerable to health-related impairments.--NEW SECTION--Young children with ADHD experience a number of health-related impairments, which are exacerbated by the presence of internalizing and externalizing co-morbidities.

27290886,10.19191/EP16.2.AD01.037,The Potential Impact of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) on public health.,"This article aims to examine the potential health effects of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment partnership (TTIP). Our review indicates that, although proponents of the TTIP claim that the treaty will produce benefits to health-enhancing determinants such as economic growth and employment, evidence shows that previous trade liberalization policies are associated with increasing economic inequities. By reducing Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and by promoting increased cooperation between US and EU governmental agencies in the pharmaceutical sector, the TTIP could result in improved research cooperation and reduced duplication of processes. However, the TTIP chapter on Intellectual Property (IP) and Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) that expand and extend patent monopolies, and delay the availability of generic drugs, are likely to cause underutilization of needed medications among vulnerable populations. The TTIP's Investor to State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) arbitration system, a mechanism that allows transnational companies (TNCs) to sue governments when a policy or law reduces the value of their investment, is likely to generate a negative impact on regulations aimed at increasing access to healthcare, and reducing tobacco, alcohol consumption, and diet-related diseases. The Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPS) of the TTIP is expected to weaken regulations in the food and agricultural sectors especially in the EU, with potentially negative effects on food safety and foodborne diseases. Finally, the ISDS is likely to infringe the ability of governments to tackle environmental problems such as climate change deemed to be the most important global health threat of the century. Our review concludes by discussing policy implications and the effect of the TTIP on democracy, national sovereignty and the balance of power between large TNCs and governments. It also discusses the adoption of an evidence-based precautionary principle approach in dealing with the health impact of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) as well as the harmonization of regulations, norms, and standards toward stronger health and environmental protection.",eng,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Nowhere is this more profound than in rural Appalachia, with Kentucky in the midst of the epidemic. The causes of this finding are multifactorial and likely related to social, economic, legal, and population factors. Evidence suggests that the economic middle class is shrinking. The traditionally white midlife demographic that used to comprise more than 80% of the US middle class now accounts for less than 60%. Along with this shrinking middle class come the inevitable trappings of poverty, including drug abuse. Population-based data reveal that the shrinking middle class is associated with a significant rise in drug abuse in the population that traditionally made up the middle class; that is, white, midlife Americans. In Kentucky, the drug of choice for abuse has changed during the past 2 decades, largely related to law enforcement and political efforts. Efforts to control drug abuse have, however, suppressed availability and use of 1 substance only to have another move to the forefront. For example, during this time abuse has shifted from methamphetamine at the turn of the century to narcotic pills during the early 2000s to intravenous injection of heroin beginning around 2010. Along with this shift in the drug of choice for abuse came an alarming trend in mortality associated with IVDA, both in Kentucky and nationally, including the need for surgical correction of IVDA-related endocarditis. Thoracic surgeons have tended to avoid or ignore the greater problems that caused the epidemic of IVDA-related endocarditis. Perhaps it is time for thoracic surgeons to give a stronger voice to the societal issues that loom in the background of this epidemic.",eng,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

An assessment of the power structure in this relationship and its influence over agenda-setting is thus the first step towards understanding where progress is still needed in policy-making for development.--NEW SECTION--This study employed qualitative policy analysis methodology to examine how health-related policy agendas are adopted in low-income countries, using Tanzania as a case study. Semi-structured, in-depth, key informant interviews with 11 policy-makers were conducted on perspectives of the agenda-setting process and its actors. Kingdon's stream theory was chosen as the lens through which to interpret the data analysis.--NEW SECTION--This study demonstrates that while stakeholders each have ways of influencing the process, the power to do so can be assessed based on three major factors: financial incentives, technical expertise, and influential position. Since donors often have two or all of these elements simultaneously a natural power imbalance ensues, whereby donor interests tend to prevail over recipient government limitations in prioritization of agendas. One way to mediate these imbalances seems to be the initiation of meaningful policy dialogue.--NEW SECTION--In Tanzania, the agenda-setting process operates within a complex network of factors that interact until a ""policy window"" opens and a decision is made. Power in this process often lies not with the Tanzanian government but with the donors, and the contrast between latent presence and deliberate use of this power seems to be based on the donor ideology behind giving aid (defined here by funding modality). Donors who used pooled funding (PF) modalities were less likely to exploit their inherent power, whereas those who preferred to maintain maximum control over the aid they provided (ie, non-pooled funders) more readily wielded their intrinsic power to push their own priorities.",eng,International journal of health policy and management,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2016

But most importantly political factors such as the global power shift and ""the rise of the rest"" will define the future of global health. A new mix of health inequity and security challenges has emerged and the 2015 humanitarian and health crises have shown the limits of existing systems. The global health as well as the humanitarian system will have to prove their capacity to respond and reform. The challenge ahead is deeply political, especially for the rising political actors. They are confronted with the consequences of a model of development that has neglected sustainability and equity, and was built on their exploitation. Some direction has been given by the path breaking international conferences in 2015. Especially the agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris agreement on climate change will shape action. Conceptually, we will need a different understanding of global health and its ultimate goals - the health of people can no longer be seen separate from the health of the planet and wealth measured by parameters of growth will no longer ensure health.",eng,International journal of health policy and management,Editorial,2025-04-23,2016

We aimed to compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between treatment groups in this trial.--NEW SECTION--CheckMate 025 was an open-label study done at 146 oncology centres in 24 countries. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment between Oct 22, 2012, and March 11, 2014. Patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma were randomly assigned (1:1, block size of four) to receive nivolumab every 2 weeks or everolimus once per day. The study was stopped early at the planned interim analysis in July, 2015, because the study met its primary endpoint. A protocol amendment permitted patients in the everolimus group to cross over to nivolumab treatment. All patients not on active study therapy are being followed up for survival. At the interim analysis, HRQoL was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index-Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS) and European Quality of Life (EuroQol)-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaires. Prespecified endpoints were to assess, in each treatment group, disease-related symptom progression rate based on the FKSI-DRS and changes in reported global health outcomes based on the EQ-5D. Other endpoints were post hoc. We calculated the proportion of FKSI-DRS questionnaires completed using the number of patients with non-missing data at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit. We defined FKSI-DRS completion as completion of five or more of the nine items in the questionnaire; otherwise data were treated as missing. FKSI-DRS symptom index score was prorated for missing items. We made no adjustments for missing EQ-5D data. We used descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses, including mixed-effects model repeated-measures, for between group comparisons. Analyses were powered according to the original study protocol, and we analysed FKSI-DRS and EQ-5D data for all patients who underwent randomisation and had a baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment. CheckMate 025 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01668784.--NEW SECTION--HRQoL data were collected at baseline for 362 (88%) of 410 patients in the nivolumab group and 344 (84%) of 411 patients in the everolimus group. The mean difference in FKSI-DRS scores between the nivolumab and everolimus groups was 1·6 (95% CI 1·4-1·9; p<0·0001) with descriptive statistics and 1·7 (1·2-2·1; p<0·0001) with mixed-effects model repeated-measures analysis. In terms of FKSI-DRS score, more patients had a clinically meaningful (ie, an increase of at least 2 points from baseline) HRQoL improvement with nivolumab (200 [55%] of 361 patients) versus everolimus (126 [37%] of 343 patients; p<0·0001). Median time to HRQoL improvement was shorter in patients given nivolumab (4·7 months, 95% CI 3·7-7·5) than in patients given everolimus (median not reached, NE-NE).--NEW SECTION--Nivolumab was associated with HRQoL improvement compared with everolimus in previously treated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.--NEW SECTION--Bristol-Myers Squibb.",eng,The Lancet.

This ""know-do"" gap leads to ineffective resource use and suboptimal provision of services, which is especially problematic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) which face greater resource limitations. Family planning, including intrauterine device (IUD) use, represents an important area to evaluate clinicians' knowledge and practices in order to make improvements.--NEW SECTION--A questionnaire was developed, tested and administered to 438 individuals in China (n = 115), Kazakhstan (n = 110), Laos (n = 105), and Mexico (n = 108). The participants responded to ten questions assessing knowledge and practices relating to contraception and IUDs, and a series of questions used to determine their individual characteristics and working context. Ordinal logistic regressions were conducted with knowledge and practices as dependent variables.--NEW SECTION--Overall, a 96 % response rate was achieved (n = 438/458). Only 2.8 % of respondents were able to correctly answer all five knowledge-testing questions, and only 0.9 % self-reported ""often"" undertaking all four recommended clinical practices and ""never"" performing the one practice that was contrary to recommendation. Statistically significant factors associated with knowledge scores included: 1) having a masters or doctorate degree; and 2) often reading scientific journals from high-income countries. Significant factors associated with recommended practices included: 1) training in critically appraising systematic reviews; 2) training in the care of patients with IUDs; 3) believing that research performed in their own country is above average or excellent in quality; 4) being based in a facility operated by an NGO; and 5) having the view that higher quality available research is important to improving their work.--NEW SECTION--This analysis supports previous work emphasizing the need for improved knowledge and practices among clinicians concerning the use of IUDs for family planning. It also identifies areas in which targeted interventions may prove effective. Assessing opportunities for increasing education and training programs for clinicians in research and IUD provision could prove to be particularly effective.",eng,Reproductive health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Given the long latency between exposure and disease, and because asbestos is still being used, MPM will remain a global health issue for decades to come. Notwithstanding the increasing incidence of MPM and the fact that patients with MPM face a poor prognosis, currently available treatment options are limited. To enable the development of novel targeted therapies, identification of the genetic alterations underlying MPM will be crucial. The first studies reporting on the genomic background of MPM identified recurrent somatic mutations in a number of tumor suppressor genes (i.e., cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene [CDKN2A], neurofibromin 2 (merlin) gene [NF2], and BRCA1 associated protein 1 gene [BAP1]). More recently, massively parallel sequencing strategies have been used and have provided a more genome-wide view on the genetic landscape of MPM. This review summarizes their results, describing alterations that cluster mainly in four pathways: the tumor protein p53/DNA repair, cell cycle, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphoinisitide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. As these pathways are important during tumor development, they provide interesting candidates for targeting with novel drugs.",eng,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Current treatment methods include parasiticidal drugs and vaccinations. However, resistance among malarial parasites to the existing drugs has emerged as a significant area of concern in anti-malarial drug design. Researchers are now desperately looking for new targets to develop anti-malarials drug which is more target specific. Malarial parasites harbor a plastid-like organelle known as the 'apicoplast', which is thought to provide an exciting new outlook for the development of drugs to be used against the parasite. This review elaborates on the current state of development of novel compounds targeted againstemerging malaria parasites.--NEW SECTION--The apicoplast, originates by an endosymbiotic process, contains a range of metabolic pathways and housekeeping processes that differ from the host body and thereby presents ideal strategies for anti-malarial drug therapy. Drugs are designed by targeting the unique mechanism of the apicoplasts genetic machinery. Several anabolic and catabolic processes, like fatty acid, isopenetyl diphosphate and heme synthess in this organelle, have also been targeted by drugs.--NEW SECTION--Apicoplasts offer exciting opportunities for the development of malarial treatment specific drugs have been found to act by disrupting this organelle's function, which wouldimpede the survival of the parasite.--NEW SECTION--Recent advanced drugs, their modes of action, and their advantages in the treatment of malaria by using apicoplasts as a target are discussed in this review which thought to be very useful in desigining anti-malarial drugs. Targetting the genetic machinery of apicoplast shows a great advantange regarding anti-malarial drug design.

27280014,10.1186/s13584-016-0079-2,Expanding clinical roles for nurses to realign the global health workforce with population needs: a commentary.,"Many countries, including Israel, face health workforce challenges to meet the needs of their citizens, as chronic conditions increase. Provider shortages and geographical maldistribution are common. Increasing the contribution of nurse practitioners and other advanced practice nursing roles through task-shifting and expansion of scope-of-practice can improve access to care and result in greater workforce efficiency. Israel and many other countries are introducing reforms to expand nurses' scope-of-practice. Recent international research offers three policy lessons for how countries just beginning to implement reforms could bypass policy barriers to implementation. First, there is substantial evidence on the equivalence in quality of care, patient safety and high consumer acceptance which should move policy debates from if to how to effectively implement new roles in practice. Second, regulatory and finance policies as well as accessible advanced education are essential to facilitate realignment of roles. Third, country experience suggests that advanced practice roles for nurses improve the attractiveness of nursing as a career thus contributing to solving nursing shortages rather than exacerbating them. Designing enabling policy environments and removing barriers will gain in relevance in the future as the demand for high-quality, patient-centered care is increasing.",eng,Israel journal of health policy research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In a bid to control the infection, the Nigerian government in 2004 introduced hepatitis B vaccine into the National Program on Immunization. There are no studies on the prevalence of hepatitis B in adolescent prior to 2004. The study was aimed at determining the seroprevalence and predictors of viral Hepatitis B in Nigerian children aged 11-19 years.--NEW SECTION--A cross sectional analytical study was conducted in July 2014. Multi-staged sampling technique was used to select 749 children from six secondary schools in Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria.

One hundred and fifty-three caregiver-survivor dyads separately provided information on patient disease and treatment-related factors, and perceived global health status (EORTC QLQ30), along with caregiver socio-demographic factors, health and care-related activities. Four multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess the influence of caregiver characteristics, patient characteristics and care-related activities on four dimensions of burden from the Caregiver Reaction Assessment scale. Caregiver characteristics significantly predicted health and financial burden (11%-13% of explained variance) with comorbidity and younger age increasing this risk. Patient health, in particular global health status and the presence of a stoma, predicted all burden scores, explaining 14%-22% of variance. Care-related activities was also a significant predictor of all burden scores, explaining an additional 5%-11% of variance, with time involved in caring the most consistent predictor. Results highlight that a combination of factors influence caregiver burden. These results may be used to identify those most at risk, allowing practitioners to deliver tailored effective support.

Although many aspects of NAFLD pathogenesis have been understood, there is a paucity of effective treatments to be used as the second line when lifestyle modification is insufficient. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol from turmeric, has been shown to be effective against development of hepatic steatosis and its progression to steatohepatitis, yet these beneficial effects have not been explored in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of curcumin on hepatic fat content as well as biochemical and anthropometric features of patients with NAFLD. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, patients with ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD were randomly assigned to receive an amorphous dispersion curcumin formulation (500 mg/day equivalent to 70-mg curcumin) or matched placebo for a period of 8 weeks. Liver fat content (assessed through ultrasonography), glycemic and lipid profile, transaminase levels, and anthropometric indices were evaluated at baseline and at the end of follow-up period. The clinical trial protocol was registered under the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ID: IRCT2014110511763N18. Compared with placebo, curcumin was associated with a significant reduction in liver fat content (78.9% improvement in the curcumin vs 27.5% improvement in the placebo group). There were also significant reductions in body mass index and serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin compared with the placebo group. Curcumin was safe and well tolerated during the course of trial. Findings of the present proof-of-concept trial suggested improvement of different features of NAFLD after a short-term supplementation with curcumin.

We used the polygenic 'lean' mouse model, which has been selected for low adiposity over 60 generations, to identify mitochondrial thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (Tst; also known as rhodanese) as a candidate obesity-resistance gene with selectively increased expression in adipocytes. Elevated adipose Tst expression correlated with indices of metabolic health across diverse mouse strains. Transgenic overexpression of Tst in adipocytes protected mice from diet-induced obesity and insulin-resistant diabetes. Tst-deficient mice showed markedly exacerbated diabetes, whereas pharmacological activation of TST ameliorated diabetes in mice. Mechanistically, TST selectively augmented mitochondrial function combined with degradation of reactive oxygen species and sulfide. In humans, TST mRNA expression in adipose tissue correlated positively with insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue and negatively with fat mass. Thus, the genetic identification of Tst as a beneficial regulator of adipocyte mitochondrial function may have therapeutic significance for individuals with type 2 diabetes.",eng,Nature medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Here, we provide an overview of the data and evidence on worldwide exposures to CVD risk factors and the associated health effects. Global comparative risk assessment studies have estimated that hundreds of thousands or millions of CVD deaths are attributable to established CVD risk factors (high blood pressure and serum cholesterol, smoking, and high blood glucose), high body mass index, harmful alcohol use, some dietary and environmental exposures, and physical inactivity. The established risk factors plus body mass index are collectively responsible for ≈9.7 million annual CVD deaths, with high blood pressure accounting for more CVD deaths than any other risk factor. Age-standardized CVD death rates attributable to established risk factors plus high body mass index are lowest in high-income countries, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean; they are highest in the region of central and eastern Europe and central Asia. However, estimates of the health effects of CVD risk factors are highly uncertain because there are insufficient population-based data on exposure to most CVD risk factors and because the magnitudes of their effects on CVDs in observational studies are likely to be biased. We identify directions for research and surveillance to better estimate the effects of CVD risk factors and policy options for reducing CVD burden by modifying preventable risk factors.",eng,Circulation,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Vaccines with induction of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have been shown to protect successfully against infections by multiple viruses and are currently developed for HCV. Areas covered: Here we review the progress towards the development of vaccines aiming to confer protection against chronic HCV infection by inducing broadly nAbs. The understanding or viral immune evasion in infected patients, the development of novel model systems and the recent structural characterization of viral envelope glycoprotein E2 has markedly advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of virus neutralization with the concomitant development of several vaccine candidates. Expert commentary: While HCV vaccine development remains challenged by the high viral diversity and immune evasion, marked progress in HCV research has advanced vaccine design. Several vaccine candidates have shown robust induction of nAbs in animal models and humans. Randomized clinical trials are the next step to assess their clinical efficacy for protection against chronic infection.",eng,Expert review of vaccines,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The bortezomib clinical-trial programme evaluated HR-QoL early and consistently, producing a large multi-study dataset. Baseline data, captured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ-C30), were pooled from six bortezomib randomized trials conducted in different disease-stage categories: 'New' (previously untreated; n = 753), 'Early' (1-3 prior therapies; n = 1569) and 'Late' (≥4 prior therapies; n = 239) disease. Mean EORTC global health scores were similar across the three stages. Unexpectedly, emotional, physical and role functioning were higher in the later stages, indicating better perceived health. Symptom scores, including pain, were largely similar or lower in the later versus earlier stages, signifying a lower symptom burden/better symptom control with more advanced disease. Notable variation in HR-QoL was observed by age and clinical parameters within and across stages. Multivariate modelling indicated that opioid use and performance status were key factors driving overall HR-QoL across stages. Using an age-restricted analysis, transplant eligibility had little impact on HR-QoL in New disease patients. Thus, changes in HR-QoL over the treatment course of MM are complex and impacted by baseline factors. A prospective observational international inception cohort study that captures key clinical, HR-QoL and demographic characteristics, along with safety and supportive care information, is needed.",eng,British journal of haematology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Techniques that are simple and suitable for fast screening to detect and identify pathogenic factors in the food chain are vital to ensure food safety. At present, a variety of analytical methods have been reported for the detection of pathogenic agents. Whereas the sensitivity of detection and quantification are still important challenges, we expect major advances from new assay formats and synthetic bio-recognition elements, such as aptamers. Owing to the specific folding capability of aptamers in the presence of an analyte, aptasensors have substantially and successfully been exploited for the detection of a wide range of small and large molecules (e.g., toxins, antibiotics, heavy metals, bacteria, viruses) at very low concentrations. Here, we review the use of aptasensors for the development of highly sensitive and affordable detection tools for food analysis.",eng,The Analyst,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

There are growing concerns amongst the public health community about the potential health implications of such WTO+ trade and investment agreements, but little existing knowledge on their potential health impacts.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a health impact review which allows for a summary estimation of the most significant health impacts of a set of policies, in our case the TPPA. Our analysis shows that there are a number of potentially serious health risks, with the following key pathways linking trade to health: access to medicines, reduced regulatory space, investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), and environmental protection and labor rights. We also note that economic gains that could translate into health benefits will likely be inequitably distributed.--NEW SECTION--Our analysis demonstrates the need for the public health community to be knowledgeable about trade issues and more engaged in trade negotiations. In the context of the COP21 climate change Agreement, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, this may be an opportune time for TPPA countries to reject it as drafted, and rethink what should be the purpose of such agreements in light of (still) escalating global wealth inequalities and fragile environmental resources-the two most foundational elements to global health equity.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Research suggests that better access to 'greenspace' (e.g. parks) may encourage physical activity and reduce the risk of obesity amongst children. We extend earlier work by considering childhood obesity in relation to proximity to the coast, using data from England's National Child Measurement Programme. Results suggest that although the overall prevalence of childhood obesity is slightly lower at the coast (-0.68% points comparing <1km to >20km, p<0.001), the relationship depends on area type. Specifically, although a coastal proximity gradient (lower obesity rates nearer the coast) was found for rural areas and smaller cities and towns, it was not present among large urban conurbations (interaction p-value<0.001). Coastal environments and access to them are changing in many areas, and research to explore potential impacts on child health is warranted.",eng,Health & place,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Currently, no pharmacological measures are discovered to prevent and treat cataract and a significant number of epidemiological studies have suggested the potential role of antioxidants in the prevention of cataract by scavenging free radicals and preventing lens protein derangement and lenticular cell damage. The main goal of the present study is to evaluate Cassia tora leaves; an edible leafy vegetable employed in Ayurvedic and Chinese system of medicine for eye rejuvenation in preventing selenite-induced cataract in rat pups and to identify the active components that produce the effect. ECT pre-treatment effectively restored both enzymatic and metabolic antioxidant levels, membrane integrity and reduced metal accumulation and thus down-regulate epithelial cell death. Gene expression studies also confirmed these findings. ESI-MS analysis of ECT revealed the presence of chrysophanol, emodin, kaemferol, quercetin, stigmasterol and isoquercetin. The study suggests the possible role of C. tora in alleviating cataract pathology and presence of many anthraquinones and flavonoids.

Although the CCR2-CCL2 axis plays an important role in trafficking CD11b(+) Ly-6C(hi) monocytes to regulate immunopathological diseases, little is known about their role in monocyte trafficking during viral encephalitis caused by JEV infection. Here, we explored the role of CCR2 and its ligand CCL2 in JE caused by JEV infection using CCR2- and CCL2-ablated murine models. Somewhat surprisingly, the ablation of CCR2 and CCL2 resulted in starkly contrasting susceptibility to JE. CCR2 ablation induced enhanced resistance to JE, whereas CCL2 ablation highly increased susceptibility to JE. This contrasting regulation of JE progression by CCR2 and CCL2 was coupled to central nervous system (CNS) infiltration of Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and Ly-6G(hi) granulocytes. There was also enhanced expression of CC and CXC chemokines in the CNS of CCL2-ablated mice, which appeared to induce CNS infiltration of these cell populations. However, our data revealed that contrasting regulation of JE in CCR2- and CCL2-ablated mice was unlikely to be mediated by innate natural killer and adaptive T-cell responses. Furthermore, CCL2 produced by haematopoietic stem cell-derived leucocytes played a dominant role in CNS accumulation of Ly-6C(hi) monocytes in infected bone marrow chimeric models, thereby exacerbating JE progression. Collectively, our data indicate that CCL2 plays an essential role in conferring protection against JE caused by JEV infection. In addition, blockage of CCR2, but not CCL2, will aid in the development of strategies for prophylactics and therapeutics of JE.",eng,Immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Inequitable distribution of health opportunities globally is a major factor in explaining why this is the case. Whereas the Protection, Promotion and Fulfilment of the health rights of poor country citizens are a joint responsibility of both domestic and external governments, most governments flout their obligations. So far disproportionate effort has been dedicated to reaffirming and interpreting these obligations as opposed to investigating the fundamental question regarding why these obligations have nevertheless remained largely unfulfilled. Further the normative question regarding what ought to be done about the shortcomings of current obligations has been largely ignored.--NEW SECTION--We conduct a critical content analysis of existing literature on efforts towards the realisation of the health rights of marginalised populations in our attempt to ascertain their capacity to guarantee basic health opportunities to marginalised populations. In our analysis we treat issues of 'health rights' and 'justice in global health' as having unity of purpose - guaranteeing basic health opportunities to the marginalised populations.--NEW SECTION--We identify two sets of reasons for the failure of present obligations for global distributive justice in general: a set of 'superficial reasons' and a set of 'fundamental reasons' which account for the superficial reasons.--NEW SECTION--In order to overcome these reasons we propose a strategy which consists in specifying a number of minimum and less-demanding obligations for both external and domestic governments to guarantee to all individuals a certain threshold of health goods and services. We argue that these minimum obligations can be freely accepted and fully complied with or enforced with ""a thin system of enforcement"" without significant threat to national sovereignty and autonomy.--NEW SECTION--The futility of countries' obligations for the health rights of the global poor as is the case with global distributive injustice is because of lack of political will to specify and enforce such obligations.

27255213,10.1093/heapol/czw060,Local adaptations to a global health initiative: penalties for home births in Zambia.,"Global health initiatives (GHIs) are implemented across a variety of geographies and cultures. Those targeting maternal health often prioritise increasing facility delivery rates. Pressure on local implementers to meet GHI goals may lead to unintended programme features that could negatively impact women. This study investigates penalties for home births imposed by traditional leaders on women during the implementation of Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) in Zambia. Forty focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted across four rural districts to assess community experiences of SMGL at the conclusion of its first year. Participants included women who recently delivered at home (3 FGDs/district), women who recently delivered in a health facility (3 FGDs/district), community health workers (2 FGDs/district) and local leaders (2 FGDs/district). Findings indicate that community leaders in some districts-independently of formal programme directive-used fines to penalise women who delivered at home rather than in a facility. Participants in nearly all focus groups reported hearing about the imposition of penalties following programme implementation. Some women reported experiencing penalties firsthand, including cash and livestock fines, or fees for child health cards that are typically free. Many women who delivered at home reported their intention to deliver in a facility in the future to avoid penalties. While communities largely supported the use of penalties to promote facility delivery, the penalties effectively introduced a new tax on poor rural women and may have deterred their utilization of postnatal and child health care services. The imposition of penalties is thus a punitive adaptation that can impose new financial burdens on vulnerable women and contribute to widening health, economic and gender inequities in communities. Health initiatives that aim to increase demand for health services should monitor local efforts to achieve programme targets in order to better understand their impact on communities and on overall programme goals.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27252539,10.1128/JVI.00221-16,Dengue Virus Subverts Host Innate Immunity by Targeting Adaptor Protein MAVS.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-borne virus infecting humans and is currently a serious global health challenge. To establish infection in its host cells, DENV must subvert the production and/or antiviral effects of interferon (IFN). The aim of this study was to understand the mechanisms by which DENV suppresses IFN production. We determined that DENV NS4A interacts with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which was previously found to activate NF-κB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), thus inducing type I IFN in the mitochondrion-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs). We further demonstrated that NS4A is associated with the N-terminal CARD-like (CL) domain and the C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain of MAVS. This association prevented the binding of MAVS to RIG-I, resulting in the repression of RIG-I-induced IRF3 activation and, consequently, the abrogation of IFN production. Collectively, our findings illustrate a new molecular mechanism by which DENV evades the host immune system and suggest new targets for anti-DENV strategies.--NEW SECTION--Type I interferon (IFN) constitutes the first line of host defense against invading viruses. To successfully establish infection, dengue virus (DENV) must counteract either the production or the function of IFN. The mechanism by which DENV suppresses IFN production is poorly understood and characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that the DENV NS4A protein plays an important role in suppressing interferon production through binding MAVS and disrupting the RIG-I-MAVS interaction in mitochondrion-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs). Our study reveals that MAVS is a novel host target of NS4A and provides a molecular mechanism for DENV evasion of the host innate immune response. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of DENV and may provide new insights into using NS4A as a therapeutic and/or prevention target.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Therefore, there is an urgent need for an effective and safe anti-TB vaccine. In the current study, a delivery system of Fc domain of mouse IgG2a and early secreted antigenic target protein 6 (ESAT-6) was evaluated for the selective uptake of antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Thus, it was based on the immunogenicity of a fusion protein. The study was initiated by the transfer of recombinant expression vectors of pPICZαA-ESAT-6:Fcγ2a and pPICZαA-ESAT-6: His into Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). Recombinant proteins were assessed for immunogenicity following the immunoblotting analysis. High levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 were produced to induce Th1-type cellular responses through vaccination with both recombinant proteins [ESAT-6:Fcγ2a (EF) and ESAT-6:His (EH)]. The Fc-tagged recombinant protein induced more effective Th1-type cellular responses with a low increment in IL-4 compared to PBS, BCG, and EH groups. Although in all the immunized groups, the ratio of IFN-γ/IL-4 was in favor of Th1 responses, the highest Th1/Th2 balance was observed in EF immunized group. Fc fragment of mouse IgG2a may induce a selective uptake of APCs towards the cross-presentation and formation of Th1 responses in favor of an appropriate protective anti-tuberculosis reaction. Thus, further research on Fc-fusion proteins is required to develop Fc-based TB vaccines.",eng,Molecular biology reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Anti-malarial medicines appear to have been particularly compromised and present a major public health threat in malaria-endemic countries, negatively affecting individuals and their communities. Concerted collaborative efforts are required from global, regional and national organizations, involving the public and private sectors, to address the problem. While many initiatives are underway, a number of unmet needs deserve urgent and increased multisector attention. At the global level, there is a need for an international public health legal framework or treaty on poor-quality medicines, with statutes suitable for integration into national laws. In addition, increased international efforts are required to strengthen the governance of global supply chains and enhance cooperation between national medicine regulation authorities and law enforcement bodies. Increased investment is needed in innovative technologies that will enable healthcare teams to detect poor-quality medicines at all levels of the supply chain. At the regional level, a number of initiatives would be beneficial-key areas are standardization, simplification, and reciprocal recognition of registration processes and development of quality control capacity in regional centres of excellence that are better aligned with public health needs; improved surveillance methods and creation of a framework for compulsory and transparent reporting of poor-quality medicines; additional support for national medicine regulation authorities and other national partner authorities; and an increase in support for regional laboratories to boost their capabilities in detecting poor-quality medicines. It is vital that all stakeholders involved in efforts against poor-quality anti-malarial medicines extend and strengthen their actions in these critical areas and thus effectively support global health development and malaria elimination programmes.",eng,Malaria journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The use of magnetoliposomes has been suggested as an effective therapeutic approach because of their good specificity for cancers. In this study, we developed two novel magnetoliposomes, namely, Gemcitabine-containing magnetoliposome (GML) and Oxaliplatin-containing magnetoliposome (OML). These magnetoliposomes were combined (CGOML) was used to treat breast cancer under an external magnetic field. Biosafety test results showed that GML and OML were biologically safe to blood cells and did not adversely affect the behavior of mice. Pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies indicated that both magnetoliposomes exhibited stable structures and persisted at the target area under an external magnetic field. Cell and animal experiments revealed that CGOML can markedly suppress the growth of MCF-7 cells, and only the CGOML group can minimize the tumor size among all the groups. Finally, CGOML can significantly inhibit MCF-7cell growth both in vitro and vivo by activating the apoptotic signaling pathway of MCF-7 cells.",eng,Oncotarget,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Each institution was contacted by both e-mail and telephone. Respondents were asked if an international experience was available for residents within their program and, if available, details of the experience were obtained.--NEW SECTION--A total of 253 general surgery residency programs were identified using the FREIDA database. Eighty-six (34 %) programs were noted to offer an international experience for their residents. A majority are incorporated into the PGY 3 and PGY 4 level of training with a duration of 1-4 weeks. Common locations are evenly distributed among the Americas and Africa and are usually funded through a combination of resident and department funding.--NEW SECTION--US resident interest in global health is growing along with an increasing demand for surgical care worldwide. This is one of the first studies to identify, quantify, and characterize in detail the international experiences currently available to general surgery residents within the general surgery training programs in the US.

27247328,10.1093/heapol/czw063,Analyzing demand-side efficiency in global health: an application to maternal care in Vietnam.,"This article investigates demand-side efficiency in global health-or the efficiency with which health system users convert public health resources into health outcomes. We introduce and explain the concept of demand-side efficiency as well as quantitative methods to empirically estimate it. Using a robust nonparametric form of technical efficiency analysis, we estimate demand side efficiency and its social determinants. We pilot these methods looking at how efficiently pregnant women in Northern Vietnam convert public health resources into appropriate maternal care as defined by national policy. We find that women who live in non-mountainous geographies, who are formally employed, who are pregnant with a boy and who are ethnic minorities are all more likely to be efficient at achieving appropriate care. We find no significant association between wealth or education and efficiency. Our results suggest that, in the Vietnamese context, women who are the most likely to achieve appropriate maternal care, are not necessarily the most likely to do so efficiently. Women who live in non-mountainous geographies and who are formally employed are both more likely to achieve appropriate care and to do so efficiently. Yet ethnic minority women, who do not systematically achieve better care, are more likely to be efficient or to achieve better care when compared with those with the same endowment of public health resources. On the methodological level, the pilot highlights that this approach can provide useful information for policy by identifying which groups of people are more and less likely to be efficient. By understanding which groups are more likely to be efficient-and in turn how and why-it may be possible to devise policies to promote the drivers of, or conversely address the constraints to, optimizing demand-side efficiency.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In January, the World Bank published Disease Control Priorities 3rd edition (DCP 3rd edition). This volume, Essential Surgery, highlighted the cost effective role of anaesthesia and surgery in global health. In April, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery released its report ""Global Surgery 2030: Evidence and solutions for achieving health, welfare, and economic development"". The report focuses on five key areas to promote change including: access to timely surgery, surgical workforce and procedural capability, surgical volume, data collection such as perioperative mortality rate, and financial protection. In May, the 68th World Health Assembly (WHA) voted in favour of Resolution A68/31: Strengthening emergency and essential surgical and anaesthesia care as a component of universal health coverage. The resolution was passed unanimously and it is the first time that surgery and anaesthesia have received such prominence at WHA level. These three events all have profound implications for the provision and access of safe anaesthesia and surgery in the Pacific region in the next 15 years. This article considers some of the regional factors that affect these five key areas, especially with regard to anaesthetic specialist workforce density in different parts of the region. There are many challenges to improve anaesthesia access, safety, and workforce density in the Pacific region.

Full details of 633 children were included for analysis. The average length of stay was 6.16 d, average hospital expenditure was US$185.67, average hospital expenses per day was US$44.00, average pharmacy expenditure was US$109.67 and average pharmacy expenditure per day was US$20.62 per patient. Children who were ventilated had approximately 61 % more expense per day as compared to non-ventilated ones. Boys and those with health insurance reported higher length of stay. Linear hierarchical regression with backward LR model showed that mechanical ventilation, multiple organ dysfunction, length of stay and insurance cover were the variables significantly affecting the final expenses.--NEW SECTION--There is a high direct expenditure incurred by families of children receiving intensive care when seen in perspective of high rates of extreme poverty in rural India. These high expenditures make critical care unaffordable to majority of the population lacking insurance cover in resource limited regions with limited universal health coverage, which ultimately leads to suboptimal care and high childhood mortality.

Legislators are adopting policies regarding appropriate medical applications, while the paucity of research may make policy decisions around conditions for which Cannabis is an effective medicine difficult. Methods: An anonymous online survey was developed to query medical Cannabis users about the conditions they use Cannabis to treat, their use patterns, perception of efficacy, and physical and mental health. Participants were recruited through social media and Cannabis dispensaries in Washington State. Results: A total of 1429 participants identified as medical Cannabis users. The most frequently reported conditions for which they used Cannabis were pain (61.2%), anxiety (58.1%), depression (50.3%), headache/migraine (35.5%), nausea (27.4%), and muscle spasticity (18.4%). On average, participants reported an 86% reduction in symptoms as a result of Cannabis use; 59.8% of medical users reported using Cannabis as an alternative to pharmaceutical prescriptions. Global health scores were on par with the general population for mental health and physical health. Conclusions: While patient-reported outcomes favor strong efficacy for a broad range of symptoms, many medical users are using Cannabis without physician supervision and for conditions for which there is no formal research to support the use of Cannabis (e.g., depression and anxiety).

Kidneys with compromised function have ongoing inflammation, including increased oxidative stress and apoptosis, peritubular capillary loss, tubular atrophy, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Promising studies have highlighted the significant potential of MSC-based strategies to mitigate fibrosis; however, reversal of established fibrosis has been problematic, suggesting that methods to potentiate MSC effects require further development. Laser treatments at visible wavelengths have been reported to enhance mitochondrial potential and available cellular ATP, facilitate proliferation, and inhibit apoptosis. We hypothesized that laser-delivered energy might provide wavelength-specific effects in the fibrotic kidney and enhance MSC responses.--NEW SECTION--Renal fibrosis, established in C57BL6 mice following 21 days of unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO), was treated with one of three wavelengths alone or with autologous MSC. Mitochondrial activity, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cytokines were measured 24 h later.--NEW SECTION--Wavelengths 405, 532, and 635 nm all significantly synergized with MSC to enhance mitochondrial activity and reduce apoptosis.

Up to one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the pathogen continues to kill 1.5 million people annually. Currently, the means for preventing, diagnosing, and treating TB are unsatisfactory. One of the main reasons for the poor progress in TB research has been a lack of good animal models to study the latency, dormancy, and reactivation of the disease. Although sophisticated in vitro and in silico methods suitable for TB research are constantly being developed, they cannot reproduce the complete vertebrate immune system and its interplay with pathogens and vaccines. However, the zebrafish has recently emerged as a useful alternative to more traditional models, such as mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, and non-human primates, for studying the complex pathophysiology of a mycobacterial infection. The model is based on the similarity between Mycobacterium marinum - a natural fish pathogen - and M. tuberculosis. In both zebrafish larvae and adult fish, an infection with M. marinum leads to the formation of macrophage aggregates and granulomas, which resemble the M. tuberculosis infections in humans. In this review, we will summarize the current status of the zebrafish model in TB research and highlight the advantages of using zebrafish to dissect mycobacterial virulence strategies as well as the host immune responses elicited against them. In addition, we will discuss the possibilities of using the adult zebrafish model for studying latency, dormancy, and reactivation in a mycobacterial infection.",eng,Frontiers in immunology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Current inactivated and live vaccines are the mainstay of the public health response to influenza, although vaccine efficacy is lower against antigenically distinct viral strains. The first pandemic of the twenty-first century underlined the urgent need to develop new vaccines capable of protecting against a broad range of influenza strains. Such ""universal"" influenza vaccines are based on the idea of heterosubtypic immunity, wherein immune responses to epitopes conserved across IAV strains can confer protection against subsequent infection and disease. T-cells recognizing conserved antigens are a key contributor in reducing viral load and limiting disease severity during heterosubtypic infection in animal models. Recent studies undertaken during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic provided key insights into the role of cross-reactive T-cells in mediating heterosubtypic protection in humans. This review focuses on human influenza to discuss the epidemiological observations that underpin cross-protective immunity, the role of T-cells as key players in mediating heterosubtypic immunity including recent data from natural history cohort studies and the ongoing clinical development of T-cell-inducing universal influenza vaccines.

Although the use of antibiotics and prevention via vaccination have reduced the incidence of meningococcal disease, our understanding regarding N. meningitidis pathogenesis is still limited, especially of those mechanisms responsible for IMD and fulminant or deadly septic shock. These severe clinical presentations occur in a limited number of subjects, whereas about 10% of healthy individuals are estimated to carry the bacteria as a commensal. Since TLR activation is involved in the defense against N. meningitidis, several studies have highlighted the association between host TLR SNPs and a higher susceptibility and severity of N. meningitidis infections. Moreover, TLR SNPs induced variations in immunological responses and in their persistence upon vaccination against meningococcal disease. In the absence of mass vaccination programs, the early identification of risk factors for meningococcal disease would be recommended in order to start immunization strategies and antibiotic treatment in those subjects carrying the risk variants. In addition, it could allow us to identify individuals with a higher risk for severe disease and sequelae in order to develop a personalized healthcare of high-risk subjects based on their genomic profile.

Microparticles have adequate theoretical properties for deep lung delivery (aerodynamic diameters between 1.15 and 1.67 μm). The cytotoxic evaluation in lung epithelial cells (A549 cells) and macrophages (THP-1 cells) revealed a toxic effect from rifabutin-loaded microparticles at the highest concentrations, but we may consider that these were very high comparing with in vivo conditions.

Now that the SDGs have been formally adopted, this comment builds on some of the insights of Forman and colleagues to examine the extent to which those rights have been incorporated in SDGs 3 and 5. I argue that sexual and reproductive health rights are relatively well-covered within the SDGs. In terms of the right to health, however, the picture is much less clear. Some of the elements that make up that right are present and correct, but the SDGs have delivered no coherent vision of how a 'right to health' might actually be realized.

27239880,10.15171/ijhpm.2016.03,"Power and Politics in the Global Health Landscape: Beliefs, Competition and Negotiation Among Global Advocacy Coalitions in the Policy-Making Process.","Advocacy coalitions play an increasingly prominent role within the global health landscape, linking actors and institutions to attract political attention and resources. This paper examines how coalitions negotiate among themselves and exercise hidden forms of power to produce policy on the basis of their beliefs and strategic interests.--NEW SECTION--This paper examines the beliefs and behaviours of health advocacy coalitions using Sabatier's Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) as an informal theoretical lens. Coalitions are further explored in relation to the concept of transnational advocacy networks (Keck and Sikkink) and of productive power (Shiffman). The ACF focuses on explaining how policy change takes place when there is conflict concerning goals and technical approaches among different actors. This study uses participant observation methods, self-reported survey results and semi-structured qualitative interviews to trace how a major policy project of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era, the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health, was constructed through negotiations among maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) advocacy coalitions.--NEW SECTION--The Global Strategy represented a new opportunity for high-level political attention. Despite differing policy beliefs, MNCH and SRHR actors collaborated to produce this strategy because of anticipated gains in political attention. While core beliefs did not shift fundamentally and collaboration was primarily a short-term tactical response to a time-bound opportunity, MNCH actors began to focus more on human rights perspectives and SRHR actors adopted greater use of quantifiable indicators and economic argumentation. This shift emphasises the inherent importance of SRHR to maternal and child health survival.--NEW SECTION--As opportunities arise, coalitions respond based on principles and policy beliefs, as well as to perceptions of advantage. Global health policy-making is an arena of contested interests, power and ideas, shaped by the interaction of coalitions. Although policy-making is often seen as a process that should be guided by evidence rather than interest-based politics, this study concludes that a participatory process of debate among different actor-coalitions is vital to progress and can lend greater legitimacy, accountability and transparency to the policy process.",eng,International journal of health policy and management,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The NS5B polymerase of HCV plays an important role in viral RNA replication process, making it an attractive therapeutic target for design and development of anti-HCV drugs. To search new potent compounds against the HCV NS5B polymerase, the molecular docking and the steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation techniques were performed. The potential potent inhibitors of the NS5B polymerase were screened out from the ZINC database using structural similarity search and molecular docking technique. Five top-hit compounds (the ZINC compounds 49888724, 49054741, 49777239, 49793673, and 49780355) were then studied by the SMD simulations based on the hypothesis that a high rupture force relates to a high binding efficiency. The results demonstrated that the ZINC compound 49888724 had a greater maximum rupture force, reflecting a good binding strength and inhibitory potency than known inhibitors and the rest four ZINC compounds. Therefore, our finding indicated that the ZINC compound 49888724 is a potential candidate to be a novel NS5B inhibitor for further design. Besides, the van der Waals interaction could be considered as the main contribution for stabilizing the NS5B-ligand complex.",eng,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Dependent variables were physical composite score (PCS) and mental composite score (MCS) of QoL of caregivers measured by the Short Form (SF-12) of Medical Outcomes Survey questionnaire. Independent variables included general characteristics of the caregivers, their unmet needs, caregiving and characteristics of cancer patients. Multiple linear regression analysis for each QoL composite score was carried out.--NEW SECTION--The average PCS was 48.7 and MCS was 47.1. Lower PCS was associated with older age, symptoms of chronic illness, depression and unmet personal needs, while concerns about the future were associated with higher physical QoL. Lower MCS was associated with anxiety, depression, unmet personal and emotional needs, and surgery in the last month. Caring for patients with a high global health status was associated with a higher MCS.--NEW SECTION--Information about caregivers' QoL and its associated factors is important in order to identify and address modifiable factors. Also, studies from different cultures like México are essential in order to identify possible generalities and particularities in QoL and its associated factors. Given the limitations of the cross-sectional design of our study, future longitudinal studies on the changes of Mexican caregivers' quality of life and their determinants will be an important step to further understanding these phenomena.",eng,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Nitroimidazoles are first-line drugs for the treatment of giardiasis and amebiasis, with metronidazole 1 being the most commonly used drug worldwide. However, treatment failures in giardiasis occur in up to 20% of cases and development of resistance to metronidazole is of concern. We have re-examined 'old' nitroimidazoles as a foundation for the systematic development of next-generation derivatives. Using this approach, derivatisation of the nitroimidazole carboxamide scaffold provided improved antiparasitic agents. Thirty-three novel nitroimidazole carboxamides were synthesised and evaluated for activity against G. lamblia and E. histolytica. Several of the new compounds exhibited potent activity against G. lamblia strains, including metronidazole-resistant strains of G. lamblia (EC50 = 0.1-2.5 μM cf. metronidazole EC50 = 6.1-18 μM).

This paper reports on an exploratory study of knowledge translation interventions conducted with participants of global health meetings held in Bangladesh in 2012 and in South Africa in 2013. We measured stakeholders' uptake of evidence-based knowledge in terms of their translation of this knowledge into actions around public health policy and practice. The research sought to determine whether participants shared and used knowledge from the meetings to improve health policy and practices in their settings and the factors influencing sharing and use.--NEW SECTION--An exploratory study employed quantitative and qualitative methods of online surveys and in-depth interviews to collect data from all meeting participants.--NEW SECTION--All participants in the Bangladesh and South Africa meetings were invited to complete an online survey during the meetings and over the following six weeks. Of 411 participants in the 2012 Bangladesh meeting, 148 participants from 22 countries completed the survey. Eleven of these respondents (from eight countries) were interviewed. Of the 436 participants in the 2013 South Africa meeting, 126 respondents from 33 countries completed an online survey; none of these respondents were interviewed.--NEW SECTION--The analysis revealed that most respondents used new knowledge to advocate for policy change (2012: 65.5%; 2013: 67.5%) or improve service quality (2012: 60.1%; 2013: 70.6%). The type of knowledge that respondents most commonly shared was clinical or scientific information (2012: 79.1%; 2013: 66.7%) and country-specific information (2012: 73.0%; 2013: 71.4%). Most 2012 respondents shared knowledge because they thought it would be useful to a co-worker or colleague (79.7%).--NEW SECTION--Findings on knowledge use and sharing suggest that most respondents saw themselves as knowledge brokers or intermediaries in a position to influence the translation of knowledge into action in health policy and practices in their countries. Results suggest that supporting knowledge brokers working in a local and regional context to spur change, as described in the paper, has the potential to improve health outcomes.

However, HIV drug-resistance, drug toxicities, therapy adherence, and the need for life-long treatment remain major challenges that continue to contribute to HIV-related global health concerns. Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have proven the potency of cellular gene therapies. An ever-growing toolbox of methods of gene manipulation, cell modification, and clinical cell manufacturing, will enable moving beyond continuous drug therapy for more effective and durable treatments, including the possibility of inducing permanent resistance to HIV.

In this study, we estimated the proportion of dementia cases attributable to illiteracy using the population attributable fraction (PAF), and calculated to what extent the monetary cost of dementia could be saved in the future by reducing illiteracy from the South Korean, Latin American, South Asian/Middle Eastern, and African populations. We collected necessary data from the 2011 United Nations Human Development Report and prevalence studies conducted in these regions. Additional variables not included in the above sources were estimated using a logit model under a ""trend scenario""-based assumption. Around 16% of the total number of dementia cases in South Korea in 2015 can be attributed to illiteracy, with this figure predicted to decline to around 2% by 2050. This translates to a saving in dementia care costs of approximately 52 billion USD, providing we are successful in theoretically eradicating illiteracy as of 2015, in the population aged 65 years or under. Likewise, reducing illiteracy to 50% in Latin America, South Asia/The Middle East, and Africa by 2050 could generate further cost savings of between 71 and 244 billion, 13 and 94 billion, and 17 and 78 billion USD, respectively. Even public policies aimed solely at reducing illiteracy in the childhood, adolescent, or middle-aged population could potentially have a role in the primary prevention of dementia.

However, there is limited evidence on the impact of integrating health services with ANC to guide policy. This review assesses the impact of integration of postnatal and other health services with ANC on health services uptake and utilisation, health outcomes and user experience of care in LMICs.--NEW SECTION--Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, POPLINE and Global Health were searched for studies that compared integrated models for delivery of postnatal and other health services with ANC to non-integrated models. Risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, depending on the study design. Due to high heterogeneity no meta-analysis could be conducted. Results are presented narratively.--NEW SECTION--12 studies were included in the review. Limited evidence, with moderate- to high-risk of bias, suggests that integrated service delivery results in improved uptake of essential health services for women, earlier initiation of treatment, and better health outcomes. Women also reported improved satisfaction with integrated services.--NEW SECTION--The reported evidence is largely based on non-randomised studies with poor generalizability, and therefore offers very limited policy guidance. More rigorously conducted and geographically diverse studies are needed to better ascertain and quantify the health and economic benefits of integrating health services with ANC.",eng,Journal of global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This study investigated the use of Google Street View (GSV) as a novel research method for collecting alcohol-related data in the urban environment.--NEW SECTION--The efficacy of GSV and on-street observation by observer teams was compared by surveying 400 m stretches of 12 streets in Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand. Data on alcohol sale, alcohol-related advertising, health promotion materials, regulatory information and visible alcohol consumption were collected.--NEW SECTION--A total of 403 retailers with evidence of alcohol sales and 1161 items of alcohol-related communication were identified in on-street observation. Of the latter, 1028 items (89 %) were for alcohol marketing and 133 (11 %) were for alcohol-related health promotion and alcohol regulation. GSV was found to be a less sensitive tool than on-street observation with only 50 % of the alcohol venues identified and 52 % of the venue-associated brand marketing identified. A high degree of inter-observer reliability was generally found between pairs of observers e.g., for the detection of alcohol retail venues the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.93 (95 % CI: 0.78 to 0.98) for on-street observation and 0.85 (95 % CI: 0.49 to 0.96) for using GSV.--NEW SECTION--GSV does not seem suitable for the comprehensive study of the influences on alcohol consumption in the urban streetscape. However, it may still have value for large, static objects in the environment and be more time efficient than traditional on-street observation measures, especially when used to collect data across a wide geographical area. Furthermore, GSV might become a more useful research tool in settings with better image quality (such as more 'footpath views') and with more regularly updated GSV imagery.",eng,BMC public health,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016

In an effort to develop and test a low-cost sustainable approach for water arsenic testing in Bangladesh, we conducted a randomized controlled trial which found arsenic educational interventions when combined with fee-based water arsenic testing programs led to nearly all households buying an arsenic test for their drinking water sources (93%) compared with only 53% when fee-based arsenic testing alone was offered. The aim of the present study was to build on the findings of this trial by investigating prospectively the psychological factors that were most strongly associated with switching to arsenic-safe wells in response to these interventions. Our theoretical framework was the RANAS (risk, attitude, norm, ability, and self-regulation) model of behavior change. In the multivariate logistic regression model of 285 baseline unsafe well users, switching to an arsenic-safe water source was significantly associated with increased instrumental attitude (odds ratio [OR] = 9.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.85, 45.00]), descriptive norm (OR = 34.02; 95% CI = [6.11, 189.45]), coping planning (OR = 11.59; 95% CI = [3.82, 35.19]), and commitment (OR = 10.78; 95% CI = [2.33, 49.99]). In addition, each additional minute from the nearest arsenic-safe drinking water source reduced the odds of switching to an arsenic-safe well by more than 10% (OR = 0.89; 95% CI = [0.87, 0.92]). Future arsenic mitigation programs should target these behavioral determinants of switching to arsenic-safe water sources.",eng,Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

So there is increasing interest from a public health perspective in addressing obesity in the management of OA. While evidence of the efficacy of intereventions designed to address obesity in OA populations continues to grow, little is known about their economic credentials. The aim of this study is to conduct a scoping review of: (i) the published economic evidence assessing the economic impact of obesity in OA populations; (ii) economic evaluations of interventions designed to explicitly address obesity in the prevention and management of OA in order to determine which represent value for money. Besides describing the current state of the literature, the study highlights research gaps and identifies future research priorities.--NEW SECTION--In July 2014, a search of the peer reviewed literature, published in English, was undertaken for the period January 1975 - July 2014 using Medline Complete (Ebscohost), Embase, Econlit, Global Health, Health Economics Evaluation Database (HEED), all Cochrane Library databases as well as the grey literature using Google and reference lists of relevant studies. A combination of key search terms was used to identify papers assessing the economic impact of obesity in OA or economic evaluations conducted to assess the efficiency of obesity interventions for the prevention or management of OA.--NEW SECTION--14 studes were identified; 13 were cost burden studies assessing the impact of obesity as a predictor for higher costs in Total Joint Arthroplasty (TJA) patients and one a cost-effectiveness study of an intervention designed to address obesity in the managment of mild to moderate OA patients.--NEW SECTION--The majority of the economic studies conducted are cost burden studies. While there is some evidence of the association between severe obesity and excess hospital costs for TJA patients, heterogeneity in studies precludes definitive statements about the strength of the association. With only one economic evaluation to inform policy and practice, there is a need for future research into the cost-effectiveness of obesity interventions designed both for prevention or management of OA along the disease spectrum and over the life course.",eng,BMC musculoskeletal disorders,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Take for example the aggressive early childhood eye cancer retinoblastoma, where survival reaches 97 % in resource-rich countries, but is as low 30 % in some resource-limited nations, where 92 % of the burden lies. This suggests a need for a multifaceted approach to achieve a tangible and sustainable increase in survival.--NEW SECTION--We assembled the history the Kenyan National Retinoblastoma Strategy (KNRbS), using information documented in NGO reports, grant applications, news articles, meeting agendas and summaries. We evaluated the KNRbS using the principles found in the guide for transboundary research partnerships developed by the Swiss Commission for Research Partnerships with Developing Countries.--NEW SECTION--A nationally co-ordinated approach drawing input and expertise from multiple disciplines and sectors presented opportunities to optimise cure of children with retinoblastoma. Annual meetings were key to achieving the over 40 major outputs of the group's efforts, related to Awareness, Medical Care, Family Support and Resource Mobilization. Three features were found to be critical to the KNRbS success: multidisciplinarity, consistency and flexibility.--NEW SECTION--The KNRbS has achieved a number of key outputs with limited financial investment.

The purpose of this paper is to report on the design and methodology of a population-based cohort study on elder mistreatment among the older Malaysian population. The study aims at gathering data and evidence to estimate the prevalence and incidence of elder mistreatment, identify its individual, familial and social determinants, and quantify its health consequences.--NEW SECTION--This is a community-based prospective cohort study using randomly selected households from the national census. A multistage sampling method was employed to obtain a total of 2496 older adults living in the rural Kuala Pilah district. The study is divided into two phases: cross-sectional study (baseline), and a longitudinal follow-up study at the third and fifth years. Elder mistreatment was measured using instrument derived from the previous literature and modified Conflict Tactic Scales. Outcomes of elder mistreatment include mortality, physical function, mental health, quality of life and health utilisation. Logistic regression models are used to examine the relationship between risk factors and abuse estimates. Cox proportional hazard regression will be used to estimate risk of mortality associated with abuse. Associated annual rate of hospitalisation and health visit frequency, and reporting of abuse, will be estimated using Poisson regression.--NEW SECTION--The study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University of Malaya Medical Center (MEC Ref 902.2) and the Malaysian National Medical Research Register (NMRR-12-1444-11726). Written consent was obtained from all respondents prior to baseline assessment and subsequent follow-up. Findings will be disseminated to local stakeholders via forums with community leaders, and health and social welfare departments, and published in appropriate scientific journals and presented at conferences.",eng,BMJ open,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) contribute 48 % towards the deaths due to NCDs in India. Though studies have been conducted in urban and rural areas, data related to tribal communities is limited. The present study aims to examine various CVD related risk factors including hypertension, elevated fasting blood glucose, obesity and metabolic syndrome among a tribal population.--NEW SECTION--The present study was an observational, cross- sectional study conducted on Rang Bhotias, a tribal population of India. The participants were adults of age between 20 and 60 years. Prior to blood sample collection, interview schedule was administered which included relevant information like age, lifestyle, socio-economic status, education and occupation In addition to this, various anthropometric and physiological measurements were taken. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of the various health disorders related to CVDs with age, gender and behavioural factors (smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity).--NEW SECTION--A total of 288 participants were surveyed for the study including 104 males and 184 females. High BMI (56.6 %), hypertension (43.4 %), metabolic syndrome (39.2 %) and abdominal obesity (33.7 %) were the most prevalent CVD risk factors observed in the population. The multivariate logistic regression analysis, conducted to examine the contribution of risk factors including behavioural risk factors on the studied abnormalities, revealed age to be a significant risk factor for all the abnormalities except elevated fasting blood glucose. Gender and physical inactivity contributed significantly towards development of hypertension. Physical inactivity was also found to be associated with high BMI levels.--NEW SECTION--In the present study, hypertension, high BMI levels, MS and abdominal obesity have been found to be high among the studied population. The status of the population with respect to these abnormalities implicates susceptibility of the community towards various common disorders. The prevention and treatment intervention programs should be implemented taking into consideration age and gender.",eng,BMC public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Rapid characterization of a DR-TB patient's complete drug resistance profile would facilitate individualized treatment in place of empirical treatment, improve treatment outcomes, prevent amplification of resistance, and reduce the transmission of DR-TB. The use of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to obtain drug resistance profiles directly from patient sputum samples has the potential to enable comprehensive evidence-based treatment plans to be implemented quickly, rather than in weeks to months, which is currently needed for phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) results. In this pilot study, we evaluated the performance of amplicon sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA from patient sputum samples using a tabletop NGS technology and automated data analysis to provide a rapid DST solution (the Next Gen-RDST assay). One hundred sixty-six out of 176 (94.3%) sputum samples from the Republic of Moldova yielded complete Next Gen-RDST assay profiles for 7 drugs of interest. We found a high level of concordance of our Next Gen-RDST assay results with phenotypic DST (97.0%) and pyrosequencing (97.8%) results from the same clinical samples. Our Next Gen-RDST assay was also able to estimate the proportion of resistant-to-wild-type alleles down to mixtures of ≤1%, which demonstrates the ability to detect very low levels of resistant variants not detected by pyrosequencing and possibly below the threshold for phenotypic growth methods. The assay as described here could be used as a clinical or surveillance tool.",eng,Journal of clinical microbiology,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2016

The programme provides a year-long training experience for qualified researchers from low and middle income countries at pharmaceutical companies or product development partnerships. Independent evaluators from the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and the Barcelona Institute for Global Health used a results-based methodology to review the programme. Data were gathered through document review, surveys, and interviews with a range of programme participants. The final evaluation report found the Career Development Fellowship to be relevant to organizers' and programme objectives, efficient in its operations, and effective in its training scheme, which was found to address needs and gaps for both fellows and their home institutions. Evaluators found that the programme has the potential for impact and sustainability beyond the programme period, especially with the successful reintegration of fellows into their home institutions, through which newly-developed skills can be shared at the institutional level. Recommendations included the development of a scheme to support the re-integration of fellows into their home institutions post-fellowship and to seek partnerships to facilitate the scaling-up of the programme. The impact of the Professional Membership Scheme, an online professional development tool launched through the programme, beyond the scope of the Career Development Fellowship programme itself to other applications, has been identified as a positive unintended outcome. The results of this evaluation may be of interest for other efforts in the field of research capacity strengthening in LMICs or, generally, to other professional development schemes of a similar structure.",eng,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2016
27223678,10.1089/omi.2016.0034,Omics of Brucella: Species-Specific sRNA-Mediated Gene Ontology Regulatory Networks Identified by Computational Biology.,"Brucella is an intracellular bacterium that causes the zoonotic infectious disease, brucellosis. Brucella species are currently intensively studied with a view to developing novel global health diagnostics and therapeutics. In this context, small RNAs (sRNAs) are one of the emerging topical areas; they play significant roles in regulating gene expression and cellular processes in bacteria. In the present study, we forecast sRNAs in three Brucella species that infect humans, namely Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, and Brucella suis, using a computational biology analysis. We combined two bioinformatic algorithms, SIPHT and sRNAscanner. In B. melitensis 16M, 21 sRNA candidates were identified, of which 14 were novel. Similarly, 14 sRNAs were identified in B. abortus, of which four were novel. In B. suis, 16 sRNAs were identified, and five of them were novel. TargetRNA2 software predicted the putative target genes that could be regulated by the identified sRNAs. The identified mRNA targets are involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, nucleotide, and coenzyme metabolism and transport, energy production and conversion, replication, recombination, repair, and transcription. Additionally, the Gene Ontology (GO) network analysis revealed the species-specific, sRNA-based regulatory networks in B. melitensis, B. abortus, and B. suis. Taken together, although sRNAs are veritable modulators of gene expression in prokaryotes, there are few reports on the significance of sRNAs in Brucella. This report begins to address this literature gap by offering a series of initial observations based on computational biology to pave the way for future experimental analysis of sRNAs and their targets to explain the complex pathogenesis of Brucella.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This case had a number of unusual features including delivery of a healthy live baby; spontaneous posterior uterine rupture in a primigravida (and unscarred uterus); and delayed presentation with signs of peritonitis and sepsis rather than haemorrhage. A 19-year old primigravida had a vaginal delivery of a live infant at term, reporting having taken herbs to induce labour. She deteriorated and was transferred to our unit where she was found to have reduced consciousness, a distended abdomen and signs of sepsis. At laparotomy there was blood-stained ascites, signs of peritonitis and a posterior lower segment uterine rupture. A sub-total hysterectomy was performed but the patient's condition worsened resulting in maternal death 5 days post-operatively.

One of the most worrying features of this rapid increase is the emergence of type 2 diabetes in children, adolescents, and young adults. Although the role of traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as genetic, lifestyle, and behavioral risk factors, has been given attention, recent research has focused on identifying the contributions of epigenetic mechanisms and the effect of the intrauterine environment. Epidemiological data predict an inexorable and unsustainable increase in global health expenditure attributable to diabetes, so disease prevention should be given high priority. An integrated approach is needed to prevent type 2 diabetes and must recognize its heterogeneity. Future research needs to be directed at improved understanding of the potential role of determinants, such as the maternal environment and other early life factors, as well as changing trends in global demography, to help shape disease prevention programs. Equally important is a better understanding of the role of metabolic surgery in helping to address the management both of persons with type 2 diabetes and of those persons in the community who are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, particularly in emerging nations where the diabetes epidemic is in full flight.",eng,Diabetes care,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

IL-27 is a member of the IL-6/IL-12 cytokine family with a broad range of anti-inflammatory properties. Recent studies highlighted the effect of a SNP in the IL-27 promoter region on modulating the progression of infectious diseases and individual responses to therapy.--NEW SECTION--The present study investigated the potential role of (-964 A/G) SNP in the promoter region of IL-27p28 gene (alleles rs153109) on the outcome of HCV infection among genotype 4a infected patients.--NEW SECTION--HCV genotyping confirmed that all of the HCV-infected patients had genotype 4a infection. Genomic DNA was extracted from 111 patients with chronic HCV infection, 42 spontaneous resolvers (SR) and 16 healthy controls. IL- 27p28.rs153109 genotyping was assessed using PCR-RFLP then confirmed by DNA sequencing.--NEW SECTION--The frequency of IL-27-p28.rs153109AA, AG, and GG genotypes among chronically infected subjects were 74.8 %, 25.2%, and 0% while among the SR, they were 57.1%, 35.7%, and 7.14%, respectively. Our data show the unique presence of G/G genotype in the SR group (3 patients; 7.14%). Moreover, the ""G"" allele frequencies among chronic and resolved subjects were 12.6% and 25.0%, respectively (p=0.0136). Importantly, subjects with the GG genotype were more likely to clear their HCV infection than those with the AA genotype (p=0.0118).--NEW SECTION--HCV genotype 4a subjects with the IL-27-p28.rs153109 A/G and G/G genotype were more likely to clear their HCV infection.

QOL scores were determined using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its breast cancer supplementary measure (QLQ-BR23). Both the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 assess items from functional and symptom scales. The QLQ-C30 in addition also measures the Global Health Status (GHS). Systematic random sampling was used to recruit patients.--NEW SECTION--223 breast cancer patients were recruited with a response rate of 92.1%.

Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito‑borne virus, which can be transmitted to humans via mosquito vectors. Previously, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan reported the country's first domestically acquired case of dengue fever for almost 70 years. To address this issue, it is important to develop novel technologies for the sensitive detection of DENV. The present study reported on the development of plasma-functionalized, graphite-encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles (GrMNPs) conjugated with anti-DENV antibody for DENV capture. Radiofrequency wave‑excited inductively‑coupled Ar and ammonia gas plasmas were used to introduce amino groups onto the surface of the GrMNPs. The GrMNPs were then conjugated with an antibody against DENV, and the antibody‑integrated magnetic beads were assessed for their ability to capture DENV. Beads incubated in a cell culture medium of DENV‑infected mosquito cells were separated from the supernatant by applying a magnetic field and were then washed. The adsorption of DENV serotypes 1‑4 onto the beads was confirmed using reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction, which detected the presence of DENV genomic RNA on the GrMNPs. The methodology described in the present study, which employed the plasma-functionalization of GrMNPs to enable antibody‑integration, represents a significant improvement in the detection of DENV.",eng,Molecular medicine reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

With the recent publications of simplified antibiotic regimens for treatment of pSBI where referral is not possible, it is important to know how and where to target these regimens, but data on the incidence and outcomes of pSBI are limited.--NEW SECTION--We used data prospectively collected at 7 rural community-based sites in 6 low and middle income countries participating in the NICHD Global Network's Maternal and Newborn Health Registry, between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. Participants included pregnant women and their live born neonates followed for 6 weeks after delivery and assessed for maternal and infant outcomes.--NEW SECTION--In a cohort of 248,539 infants born alive between 2010 and 2013, 32,088 (13 %) neonates met symptomatic criteria for pSBI. The incidence of pSBI during the first 6 weeks of life varied 10 fold from 3 % (Zambia) to 36 % (Pakistan), and overall case fatality rates varied 8 fold from 5 % (Kenya) to 42 % (Zambia). Significant variations in incidence of pSBI during the study period, with proportions decreasing in 3 sites (Argentina, Kenya and Nagpur, India), remaining stable in 3 sites (Zambia, Guatemala, Belgaum, India) and increasing in 1 site (Pakistan), cannot be explained solely by changing rates of facility deliveries. Case fatality rates did not vary over time.--NEW SECTION--In a prospective population based registry with trained data collectors, there were wide variations in the incidence and case fatality of pSBI in rural communities and in trends over time.

The aim of the present study was to examine the role of transmembrane protein 9 (TMEM9) in cell progression, such as cell growth, cell cycle, cell metastasis of hepatoma cells, and to discuss the TMEM9 gene‑encoding protein as a potential therapy target of hepatoma. RT-qPCR was performed to examine TMEM9 expression in tumor tissues and adjacent tissues of patients with liver cancer. siRNAs were used to interfere TMEM9 in HepG2 and 7721 cells. A CCK-8 assay was performed to evaluate cell growth at 24, 48 and 72 h. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Transwell assays were used to determine cell invasion, migration and adhesion. The results showed that TMEM9 was expressed abnormally in liver cancers. TMEM9 expression increased significantly in the 34 examined patients. TMEM9 knockdown inhibited proliferation in the HepG2 and 7721 cells. The flow cytometric analysis revealed that TMEM9 knockdown by RNA interference resulted in G1 arrest and induced apoptosis. Cell invasion, migration and adhesion ability were also decreased. Western blotting indicated that expression of the cell cycle‑related proteins CDK1, EIF3H, RPL10L, S100A10, CCNB1 and CCNB2 was significantly decreased.

Whilst studies have shown that child labour may be harmful to children's physical health, little is known about child labour's effects on mental health. It is important to understand the relationship between work and mental health problems during childhood, and identify possible risk factors for poorer mental health. A systematic literature review was conducted. Published papers in any language that compared the mental health of children (<18 years) who had been exposed to work with those who had not been exposed to work were included. Twelve published observational studies on the association between child labour and general psychopathology, internalising and externalising problems were identified. Child labour was found to be strongly associated with poor mental health outcomes in seven studies. More significant associations were found between child labour and internalising problems than externalising problems. The burden of poor mental health as a result of child labour is significant given the numbers of children in work. Risk factors for poorer mental health were involvement in domestic labour, younger age, and greater intensity of work, which could be due to the potential of child labour to cause isolation, low self-esteem, and perception of an external locus of control. The risk factors suggested by this review will have implications for policy makers.

27212845,10.4103/0974-2069.180668,Amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in children with latent rheumatic heart disease.,"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a global cause of early heart failure. Early RHD is characterized by valvar regurgitation, leading to ventricular distention and possible elaboration of amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). We investigated the ability of NT-proBNP to distinguish cases of latent RHD detected by echocardiographic screening from the controls.--NEW SECTION--Ugandan children (N = 44, 36% males, mean age: 12 ± 2 years) with latent RHD (cases) and siblings (controls) by echocardiography were enrolled. Cases and controls were matched for age and sex, and they had normal hemoglobin (mean: 12.8 mg/dL). Children with congenital heart disease, pregnancy, left ventricular dilation or ejection fraction (EF) below 55%, or other acute or known chronic health conditions were excluded. RHD cases were defined by the World Heart Federation (WHF) 2012 consensus guideline criteria as definite. Controls had no echocardiography (echo) evidence for RHD. At the time of echo, venous blood samples were drawn and stored as serum. NT-proBNP levels were measured using sandwich immunoassay. Paired t-tests were used to compare NT-proBNP concentrations including sex-specific analyses.--NEW SECTION--The mean NT-proBNP concentration in the cases was 105.74 ± 67.21 pg/mL while in the controls, it was 86.63 ± 55.77 pg/mL. The cases did not differ from the controls (P = 0.3). In sex-specific analyses, male cases differed significantly from the controls (158.78 ± 68.82 versus 76 ± 42.43, P = 0.008). Female cases did not differ from the controls (75.44 ± 45.03 versus 92.30 ± 62.35 respectively, P = 0.4).--NEW SECTION--Serum NT-proBNP did not distinguish between latent RHD cases and the controls. Sex and within-family exposures may confound this result. More investigation into biomarker-based RHD detection is warranted.",eng,Annals of pediatric cardiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

One chemical is temephos, an organophosphate used to control mosquitoes. The other is chlorine-based products, which are used to disinfect surfaces and water. While global health projects tend to treat these substances as stable objects, there are three ways in which they might be understood as leaky things, implicated in fluid social interactions. First, global health chemicals are tracked through rigid accounting, but because of numerical leakages, they become vehicles for fashioning new forms of concern. Second, chemicals leak structurally: They can be dissolved and reproduced at a molecular level, although that dissolution is never absolute, and that reproduction is not everywhere the same. Third, chemicals leak in a sensory fashion. Sensory interactions with chemicals produce an entanglement of knowledge about bodies and environments.",eng,Medical anthropology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017
27212427,10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30594-3,Assessment of economic vulnerability to infectious disease crises.,"Infectious disease crises have substantial economic impact. Yet mainstream macroeconomic forecasting rarely takes account of the risk of potential pandemics. This oversight contributes to persistent underestimation of infectious disease risk and consequent underinvestment in preparedness and response to infectious disease crises. One reason why economists fail to include economic vulnerability to infectious disease threats in their assessments is the absence of readily available and digestible input data to inform such analysis. In this Viewpoint we suggest an approach by which the global health community can help to generate such inputs, and a framework to use these inputs to assess the economic vulnerability to infectious disease crises of individual countries and regions. We argue that incorporation of these risks in influential macroeconomic analyses such as the reports from the International Monetary Fund's Article IV consultations, rating agencies and risk consultancies would simultaneously improve the quality of economic risk forecasting and reinforce individual government and donor incentives to mitigate infectious disease risks.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Several factors are currently increasing the challenge posed by norovirus infections to global health, notably the increasing number of infections in immunocompromised individuals, who are more susceptible to disease, and the globalization of the food industry, which enables large norovirus outbreaks to occur on an international scale. Furthermore, the rapid rate of the genetic and antigenic evolution of circulating noroviruses complicates the development of vaccines and therapies that are required to counter these challenges. In this Review, we describe recent advances in the study of the transmission, pathogenesis and evolution of human noroviruses, and consider the ongoing risk of norovirus outbreaks, together with the future prospects for therapeutics, in a rapidly changing world.",eng,Nature reviews.

Genital warts caused by HPV 6 and 11 have a lifetime risk of acquisition of 10%. HPV vaccines are subunit vaccines consisting of virus like particles comprised of the L1 major capsid protein. Two vaccines have been licenced since 2006/2007 and are in the National Immunisation programmes in 62 countries. Both vaccines include HPV 16 and 18 VLPs and one also includes HPV 6 and 11. The vaccines are highly immunogenic and well tolerated. Genital HPV is a sexually transmitted infection with peak incidence occurring just after the onset of sexual activity and the routine cohort for immunisation in almost all countries are adolescent girls 9-15 years of age with or without catch up for older adolescents and young women. Population effectiveness is now being demonstrated for these vaccines in countries with high vaccine coverage. HPV vaccines are highly immunogenic and effective and the original 3 dose schedules have already been reduced, for those 14 years and under, to 2 for both licenced vaccines. There is preliminary evidence that 1 dose of vaccine is as effective as 2 or 3 in preventing persistent HPV infection in the cervix in young women and further reductions in dosage may be possible if supported by appropriate virological, immunological and modelling studies.",eng,The Journal of infection,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

As the population of these regions age, and as death from infectious diseases decrease, this burden will increase further without strong intervention.

Currently, interferon-alpha, with the underlying mechanism of host immunomodulation, and nucleos(t)ide analogs, with the underlying mechanism of inhibition of viral replication, are used for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B. Despite remarkable improvement in the virological, serological, biochemical, and histological response to current therapeutics, we are still far from meeting the therapeutic goals, e.g., clearance of HBV DNA/covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the serum/liver tissue and seroconversion of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to anti-HBs in the present antiviral era. Recently, HBV replication cycle-related, viral RNA interference-based, and host immune-mediated therapeutic targets and relevant anti-HBV agents have been newly introduced and investigated in the preclinical and clinical fields.

27208372,10.2337/dc16-0205,Type 2 Diabetes: Why We Are Winning the Battle but Losing the War? 2015 Kelly West Award Lecture.,"Diabetes is among the biggest of the 21st-century global health challenges. In the U.S. and other high-income countries, thanks to investments in science, dedication to implementing these findings, and measurement of quality of care, there have been improvements in diabetes management and declines in rate of diabetes complications and mortality. This good news, however, is overshadowed by the ever-increasing absolute numbers of people with diabetes and its complications and the unprecedented growth of diabetes in low- and middle-income countries of the world. To comprehensively win the war against diabetes requires 1) concerted attention to prevention and 2) expansion of global research to better inform population-level policies to curb diabetes but also to better understand individual- and population-level variations in pathophysiology and phenotypes globally so that prevention and treatment can be tailored. For example, preliminary data show that thin people in low- and middle-income countries such as India commonly experience type 2 diabetes. Global studies comparing these thin Asian Indians with other high-risk groups such as Pima Indians, a population with a high mean BMI, suggest that type 2 diabetes may not be a single pathophysiological entity. Pima Indians may represent the well-studied phenotype of poor insulin action (type 2A), whereas Asian Indians represent the grossly understudied phenotype of poor insulin secretion (type 2B). This has major implications for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment and highlights the mismatch between where diabetes burdens occur (i.e., low- and middle-income countries) and where research happens (i.e., high-income countries). Correcting this imbalance will advance our knowledge and arsenal to win the global war against diabetes.",eng,Diabetes care,Lecture,2025-04-23,2016
27207731,10.1002/14651858.CD010351.pub2,Participation in environmental enhancement and conservation activities for health and well-being in adults: a review of quantitative and qualitative evidence.,"There is growing research and policy interest in the potential for using the natural environment to enhance human health and well-being. This resource may be underused as a health promotion tool to address the increasing burden of common health problems such as increased chronic diseases and mental health concerns. Outdoor environmental enhancement and conservation activities (EECA) (for instance unpaid litter picking, tree planting or path maintenance) offer opportunities for physical activity alongside greater connectedness with local environments, enhanced social connections within communities and improved self-esteem through activities that improve the locality which may, in turn, further improve well-being.--NEW SECTION--To assess the health and well-being impacts on adults following participation in environmental enhancement and conservation activities.--NEW SECTION--We contacted or searched the websites of more than 250 EECA organisations to identify grey literature. Resource limitations meant the majority of the websites were from UK, USA, Canada and Australia. We searched the following databases (initially in October 2012, updated October 2014, except CAB Direct, OpenGrey, SPORTDiscus, and TRIP Database), using a search strategy developed with our project advisory groups (predominantly leaders of EECA-type activities and methodological experts): ASSIA; BIOSIS; British Education Index; British Nursing Index; CAB Abstracts; Campbell Collaboration; Cochrane Public Health Specialized Register; DOPHER; EMBASE; ERIC; Global Health; GreenFILE; HMIC; MEDLINE-in-Process; MEDLINE; OpenGrey; PsychINFO; Social Policy and Practice; SPORTDiscus; TRoPHI; Social Services Abstracts; Sociological Abstracts; The Cochrane Library; TRIP database; and Web of Science. Citation and related article chasing was used. Searches were limited to studies in English published after 1990.--NEW SECTION--Two review authors independently screened studies. Included studies examined the impact of EECA on adult health and well-being. Eligible interventions needed to include each of the following: intended to improve the outdoor natural or built environment at either a local or wider level; took place in urban or rural locations in any country; involved active participation; and were NOT experienced through paid employment.We included quantitative and qualitative research. Includable quantitative study designs were: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi-RCTs, cluster quasi-RCTs, controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted-time-series, cohort studies (prospective or retrospective), case-control studies and uncontrolled before-and-after studies (uBA). We included qualitative research if it used recognised qualitative methods of data collection and analysis.--NEW SECTION--One reviewer extracted data, and another reviewer checked the data. Two review authors independently appraised study quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool (for quantitative studies) or Wallace criteria (for qualitative studies). Heterogeneity of outcome measures and poor reporting of intervention specifics prevented meta-analysis so we synthesised the results narratively. We synthesised qualitative research findings using thematic analysis.--NEW SECTION--Database searches identified 21,420 records, with 21,304 excluded at title/abstract. Grey literature searches identified 211 records. We screened 327 full-text articles from which we included 21 studies (reported in 28 publications): two case-studies (which were not included in the synthesis due to inadequate robustness), one case-control, one retrospective cohort, five uBA, three mixed-method (uBA, qualitative), and nine qualitative studies. The 19 studies included in the synthesis detailed the impacts to a total of 3,603 participants: 647 from quantitative intervention studies and 2630 from a retrospective cohort study; and 326 from qualitative studies (one not reporting sample size).Included studies shared the key elements of EECA defined above, but the range of activities varied considerably. Quantitative evaluation methods were heterogeneous. The designs or reporting of quantitative studies, or both, were rated as 'weak' quality with high risk of bias due to one or more of the following: inadequate study design, intervention detail, participant selection, outcome reporting and blinding.Participants' characteristics were poorly reported; eight studies did not report gender or age and none reported socio-economic status. Three quantitative studies reported that participants were referred through health or social services, or due to mental ill health (five quantitative studies), however participants' engagement routes were often not clear.Whilst the majority of quantitative studies (n = 8) reported no effect on one or more outcomes, positive effects were reported in six quantitative studies relating to short-term physiological, mental/emotional health, and quality-of-life outcomes. Negative effects were reported in two quantitative studies; one study reported higher levels of anxiety amongst participants, another reported increased mental health stress.The design or reporting, or both, of the qualitative studies was rated as good in three studies or poor in nine; mainly due to missing detail about participants, methods and interventions. Included qualitative evidence provided rich data about the experience of participation. Thematic analysis identified eight themes supported by at least one good quality study, regarding participants' positive experiences and related to personal/social identity, physical activity, developing knowledge, spirituality, benefits of place, personal achievement, psychological benefits and social contact. There was one report of negative experiences.--NEW SECTION--There is little quantitative evidence of positive or negative health and well-being benefits from participating in EECA. However, the qualitative research showed high levels of perceived benefit among participants. Quantitative evidence resulted from study designs with high risk of bias, qualitative evidence lacked reporting detail. The majority of included studies were programme evaluations, conducted internally or funded by the provider.The conceptual framework illustrates the range of interlinked mechanisms through which people believe they potentially achieve health and well-being benefits, such as opportunities for social contact. It also considers potential moderators and mediators of effect.One main finding of the review is the inherent difficulty associated with generating robust evidence of effectiveness for complex interventions. We developed the conceptual framework to illustrate how people believed they benefited. Investigating such mechanisms in a subsequent theory-led review might be one way of examining evidence of effect for these activities.The conceptual framework needs further refinement through linked reviews and more reliable evidence. Future research should use more robust study designs and report key intervention and participant detail.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Interventions delivered via text messaging (short message service, SMS) may increase access to educational and support services that promote smoking cessation across diverse populations.--NEW SECTION--The purpose of this meta-analysis is to (1) evaluate the efficacy of text messaging interventions on smoking outcomes, (2) determine the robustness of the evidence, and (3) identify moderators of intervention efficacy.--NEW SECTION--Electronic bibliographic databases were searched for records with relevant key terms. Studies were included if they used a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine a text messaging intervention focusing on smoking cessation. Raters coded sample and design characteristics, and intervention content. Summary effect sizes, using random-effects models, were calculated and potential moderators were examined.--NEW SECTION--The meta-analysis included 20 manuscripts with 22 interventions (N=15,593; 8128 (54%) women; mean age=29) from 10 countries. Smokers who received a text messaging intervention were more likely to abstain from smoking relative to controls across a number of measures of smoking abstinence including 7-day point prevalence (odds ratio (OR)=1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.22, 1.55, k=16) and continuous abstinence (OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.19, 2.24, k=7). Text messaging interventions were also more successful in reducing cigarette consumption relative to controls (d+=0.14, 95% CI=0.05, 0.23, k=9). The effect size estimates were biased when participants who were lost to follow-up were excluded from the analyses. Cumulative meta-analysis using the 18 studies (k=19) measuring abstinence revealed that the benefits of using text message interventions were established only after only five RCTs (k=5) involving 8383 smokers (OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.15, 1.67, P<.001). The inclusion of the subsequent 13 RCTs (k=14) with 6870 smokers did not change the established efficacy of text message interventions for smoking abstinence (OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.25, 1.51, P<.001). Smoking abstinence rates were stronger when text messaging interventions (1) were conducted in Asia, North America, or Europe, (2) sampled fewer women, and (3) recruited participants via the Internet.--NEW SECTION--The evidence for the efficacy of text messaging interventions to reduce smoking behavior is well-established. Using text messaging to support quitting behavior, and ultimately long-term smoking abstinence, should be a public health priority.",eng,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Regression analyses were conducted to identify reproductive health, socioeconomic, and other characteristics that increased the likelihood of undergoing an obstetric ultrasonographic examination.--NEW SECTION--Among 6182 women, 1630 (26.4%) had undergone obstetric ultrasonography during their most recent pregnancy, of whom 1011 (62.0%) received only one examination. Odds of receiving an ultrasonographic examination were higher among women with post-secondary education than among those with none (≥11years' education: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.55-19.04), and among women whose husbands had post-secondary education than among those with husbands with none (≥11years' education: aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.47-2.69).

Funding alone is not sufficient to address the complex issues and challenges plaguing these health systems. To see lasting improvement in maternal and infant health outcomes in the developing world, a global commitment to the sharing of knowledge and resources through international partnerships is critical. But partnerships that merely introduce western medical techniques and protocols to low resource settings, without heeding the local contexts, are misguided and unsustainable. Forming partnerships with mutual respect, shared vision, and collaborative effort is needed to ensure that all parties, irrespective of whether they belong to resource rich or resource poor settings, learn from each other so that meaningful and sustained system strengthening can take place.--NEW SECTION--In this paper, we describe the partnership building model of an international NGO, Kybele, which is committed to achieving childbirth safety through sustained partnerships in low resource settings. The Kybele model adapts generic stages of successful partnerships documented in the literature to four principles relevant to Kybele's work. A multiple-case study approach is used to demonstrate how the model is applied in different country settings.--NEW SECTION--The four principle of Kybele's partnership model are robust drivers of successful partnerships in diverse country settings.--NEW SECTION--Much has been written about the need for multi-country partnerships to achieve sustainable outcomes in global health, but few papers in the literature describe how this has been achieved in practice.

The aims of this study were to assess HRQoL, anxiety, and depression pre- and post-diagnosis in patients undergoing diagnostic evaluations for cancer due to non-specific symptoms; to examine changes over time in relation to final diagnosis (cancer yes/no); and to assess the predictive value of pre-diagnostic psychological, socio-demographic and clinical factors.--NEW SECTION--A prospective, multicenter survey study of patients suspected to have cancer based on non-specific symptoms was performed. Participants completed the EORTC-QLQ-C30 quality of life scale, HADS, SOC-13 and self-rated health before and after completing diagnostic evaluations. Intra- and inter-group differences between patients diagnosed with cancer versus patients with non-cancer diagnoses were calculated. The impact of baseline psychological, socio-demographic, and medical factors on HRQoL, anxiety and depression at follow-up was explored by bootstrapped multivariate linear regression analyses and logistic regression analyses.--NEW SECTION--A total of 838 patients participated in this study; 679 (81 %) completed the follow-up. Twenty-two percent of the patients received a cancer diagnosis at the end of the follow-up. Patients presented initially with a high burden of symptoms and affected role and emotional functioning and global health/QL, irrespective of diagnosis.

HRQoL and anxiety improved after diagnosis, and a larger improvement was seen in patients who received a non-cancer diagnosis. There were no intra- or inter-group differences in the depression scores. The strongest predictors of global QL, anxiety, and depression after a known diagnosis were baseline scores, co-morbidity and poor self-rated health.--NEW SECTION--Patients undergoing diagnostic evaluations for cancer based on non-specific symptoms experience a high prevalence of anxiety and affected quality of life prior to knowledge of the diagnosis.

However, identifying the most effective and efficient strategies to deliver these resources to where they are most needed has been a challenge. Targeted and integrated interventions have been the main delivery strategies. However, the health system discourse increasingly favours integrated strategies in the context of functionally merging targeted interventions with multifunctional health care delivery systems with a focus on strengthening country health systems to deliver needed interventions. Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) have been identified to promote and perpetuate poverty hence there has been global effort to combat these diseases. The Neglected Tropical Diseases Programme (NTDP) in Ghana has a national programme team and office, however, it depends on the multifunctional health delivery system at the regional and district level to implement interventions. The NTDP seeks further health system integration to accelerate achievement of coverage targets. The study estimated the extent of integration of the NTDP at the national, regional and district levels to provide evidence to guide further integration.--NEW SECTION--The research design was a descriptive case study that interviewed key persons involved in the programme at the three levels of the health system as well as extensive document review. Integration was assessed on two planes-across health system functions-stewardship and governance, financing, planning, service delivery, monitoring and evaluation and demand generation; and across three administrative levels of the health system-national, regional and district. A composite measure of integration designated Cumulative Integration Index (CII) with a range of 0.00-1.00 was used to estimate extent of integration at the three levels of the health system. Service delivery was most integrated while financing and planning were least integrated. Extent of integration was partial at all levels of the health system with a CII of 0.48-0.68; however it was higher at the district compared to the national and regional levels.--NEW SECTION--To ensure further integration of the NTDP, planning and finance management activities must be decentralized to involve regional and district levels of the health system.

Yet, studies on hypertension rarely focus on women in Ghana. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the prevalence and sociodemographic determinants of hypertension history among Ghanaian women in reproductive age. Methods. This study used data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were carried out to ascertain the prevalence and determinants of hypertension history among the respondents. Results. The study found that the overall prevalence of hypertension history among the respondents was 7.5%; however, there were vast variations within most of the sociodemographic categories. Age, level of education, marital status, work status, and wealth status had a significant relationship with hypertension history among the respondents. Women in advanced age groups, highly educated, married, and widowed/divorced/separated, nonworking women, and women from wealthy households were at higher risk of having hypertension history.

27199819,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00584,Profiles of Recovery from Mood and Anxiety Disorders: A Person-Centered Exploration of People's Engagement in Self-Management.,"A shift toward person-centered care has been occurring in services provided to people with mood and anxiety disorders. Recovery is recognized as encompassing personal aspects in addition to clinical ones. Guidelines now recommend supporting people's engagement in self-management as a complementary recovery avenue. Yet the literature lacks evidence on how individualized combinations of self-management strategies used by people relate to their clinical and personal recovery indicators.--NEW SECTION--The aims of this study were to identify profiles underlying mental health recovery, describe the characteristics of participants corresponding to each profile, and examine the associations of profiles with criterion variables.--NEW SECTION--149 people recovering from anxiety, depressive, or bipolar disorders completed questionnaires on self-management, clinical recovery (symptom severity), personal recovery (positive mental health), and criterion variables (personal goal appraisal, social participation, self-care abilities, coping).--NEW SECTION--Latent profile analysis (LPA) revealed three profiles. The Floundering profile included participants who rarely used self-management strategies and had moderately severe symptoms and the lowest positive mental health. The Flourishing profile was characterized by frequent use of self-empowerment strategies, the least severe symptoms, and the highest positive mental health. Participants in the Struggling profile engaged actively in several self-management strategies focused on symptom reduction and healthy lifestyle. They concomitantly reported high symptom severity and moderately high positive mental health. The study revealed that Floundering was associated with higher probabilities of being a man, being single, and having a low income. People in the Flourishing profile had the most favorable scores on criterion variables, supporting the profiles' construct validity.--NEW SECTION--The mixed portrait of Struggling participants on recovery indicators suggests the relationship between health engagement and recovery is more intricate than anticipated. Practitioners should strive for a holistic understanding of their clients' self-management strategies and recovery indicators to provide support personalized to their profile. While people presenting risk factors would benefit from person-centered support, societal efforts are needed in the long term to reduce global health inequalities. The integration of constructs from diverse fields (patient-centered care, chronic illness, positive psychology) and the use of person-oriented analysis yielded new insights into people's engagement in their health and well-being.",eng,Frontiers in psychology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27197516,10.2196/mental.5611,A Thematic Analysis of Stigma and Disclosure for Perinatal Depression on an Online Forum.,"Perinatal mental illness is a global health concern; however, many women do not get the treatment they need to recover. Some women choose not to seek professional help and get no treatment because they feel stigmatized. Online forums for various health conditions, including perinatal mental health, can be beneficial for members. Little is known about the role that online forums for perinatal mental illness play in reducing stigma and subsequent disclosure of symptoms to health care providers and treatment uptake.--NEW SECTION--This study aimed to examine stigma and disclosure in forums and describe any potential disadvantages of forum use.--NEW SECTION--An online forum for mothers was examined and 1546 messages extracted from 102 threads from the antenatal and postnatal depression section. These messages were subjected to deductive systematic thematic analysis to identify common themes regarding stigma and disclosure of symptoms and potential disadvantages of forum use.--NEW SECTION--Two major themes were identified: stigma and negative experiences of disclosure. Stigma had 3 subthemes: internal stigma, external stigma, and treatment stigma. Many women were concerned about feeling like a ""bad"" or ""failed"" mother and worried that if they disclosed their symptoms to a health care provider they would be stigmatized. Posts in response to this frequently encouraged women to disclose their symptoms to health care providers and accept professional treatment. Forum discourse reconstructed the ideology of motherhood as compatible with perinatal mental illness, especially if the woman sought help and adhered to treatment. Many women overcame stigma and replied that they had taken advice and disclosed to a health care provider and/or taken treatment.--NEW SECTION--Forum use may increase women's disclosure to health care providers by challenging their internal and external stigma and this may strengthen professional treatment uptake and adherence. However, a few posts described negative experiences when disclosing to health care providers.",eng,JMIR mental health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27196933,10.3390/diagnostics6020019,Improving the Sensitivity and Functionality of Mobile Webcam-Based Fluorescence Detectors for Point-of-Care Diagnostics in Global Health.,"Resource-poor countries and regions require effective, low-cost diagnostic devices for accurate identification and diagnosis of health conditions. Optical detection technologies used for many types of biological and clinical analysis can play a significant role in addressing this need, but must be sufficiently affordable and portable for use in global health settings. Most current clinical optical imaging technologies are accurate and sensitive, but also expensive and difficult to adapt for use in these settings. These challenges can be mitigated by taking advantage of affordable consumer electronics mobile devices such as webcams, mobile phones, charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras, lasers, and LEDs. Low-cost, portable multi-wavelength fluorescence plate readers have been developed for many applications including detection of microbial toxins such as C. Botulinum A neurotoxin, Shiga toxin, and S. aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), and flow cytometry has been used to detect very low cell concentrations. However, the relatively low sensitivities of these devices limit their clinical utility. We have developed several approaches to improve their sensitivity presented here for webcam based fluorescence detectors, including (1) image stacking to improve signal-to-noise ratios; (2) lasers to enable fluorescence excitation for flow cytometry; and (3) streak imaging to capture the trajectory of a single cell, enabling imaging sensors with high noise levels to detect rare cell events. These approaches can also help to overcome some of the limitations of other low-cost optical detection technologies such as CCD or phone-based detectors (like high noise levels or low sensitivities), and provide for their use in low-cost medical diagnostics in resource-poor settings.",eng,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27195968,10.1089/omi.2016.0028,A Network Biology Approach to Decipher Stress Response in Bacteria Using Escherichia coli As a Model.,"The development of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria poses challenges to global health for their treatment and control. In this context, stress response enables bacterial populations to survive extreme perturbations in the environment but remains poorly understood. Specific modules are activated for unique stressors with few recognized global regulators. The phenomenon of cross-stress protection strongly suggests the presence of central proteins that control the diverse stress responses. In this work, Escherichia coli was used to model the bacterial stress response. A Protein-Protein Interaction Network was generated by integrating differentially expressed genes in eight stress conditions of pH, temperature, and antibiotics with relevant gene ontology terms. Topological analysis identified 24 central proteins. The well-documented role of 16 central proteins in stress indicates central control of the response, while the remaining eight proteins may have a novel role in stress response. Cluster analysis of the generated network implicated RNA binding, flagellar assembly, ABC transporters, and DNA repair as important processes during response to stress. Pathway analysis showed crosstalk of Two Component Systems with metabolic processes, oxidative phosphorylation, and ABC transporters. The results were further validated by analysis of an independent cross-stress protection dataset. This study also reports on the ways in which bacterial stress response can progress to biofilm formation. In conclusion, we suggest that drug targets or pathways disrupting bacterial stress responses can potentially be exploited to combat antibiotic tolerance and multidrug resistance in the future.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

There are widespread misconceptions, by both parturients and health care providers, that labor epidural analgesia is harmful to mother and baby. Meanwhile, China has one of the highest cesarean delivery rates in the world, exceeding 50%. The goal of the nongovernmental No Pain Labor & Delivery (NPLD) is to facilitate sustainable increases in vaginal delivery rates by increasing access to safe neuraxial labor analgesia, thereby decreasing the cesarean delivery rate. NPLD was launched in 2008 with the stated goal of improving labor outcome in China by increasing the absolute labor epidural analgesia rate by 10%. NPLD established 10 training centers over a 10-year period. We hypothesized that increased availability of labor analgesia would result in reduced requests for cesarean delivery and better labor outcomes for mother and baby. Multidisciplinary teams of Western clinicians and support staff traveled to China for 8 to 10 days once a year. The approach involved establishing 24/7 obstetric anesthesia coverage in Chinese hospitals through education and modeling multidisciplinary approaches, including problem-based learning discussions, bedside teaching, daily debriefings, simulation training drills, and weekend conferences. As of November 2015, NPLD has engaged with 31 hospitals. At 24 of these sites, 24/7 obstetric anesthesia coverage has been established and labor epidural analgesia rates have exceeded 50%. Lower rates of cesarean delivery, episiotomy, postpartum blood transfusion, and better neonatal outcomes were documented in 3 impact studies comprising approximately 55,000 deliveries. Changes in practice guidelines, medical policy, and billing codes have been implemented in conjunction with the modernization of perinatal practice that has occurred concurrently in China since the first NPLD trip in 2008.",eng,Anesthesia and analgesia,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2016

Patients continued treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, until commercial availability of everolimus, or May 2012, whichever came first. Adverse events (AEs) were analyzed according to Common Terminology Criteria version 4.0. HRQOL was assessed at baseline, for three 28-day cycles, and then at every three cycles until end of treatment (EOT) with EQ-5D, EORTC QLQ-C30, and EORTC QLQ-GINET21 instruments.--NEW SECTION--The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs included hyperglycemia, infections, stomatitis, fatigue, and abdominal pain. In patients with pNET, mean (± SD) EQ VAS score remained stable at EOT (baseline, 68.8 ± 19.9 vs. EOT, 66.5 ± 20.6) without clinically significant change in QLQ-C30 global health status (change from baseline, - 3.9; n = 86). For patients with non-pNET, a reduction in EQ VAS score (63.9 ± 19.0 vs. 55.3 ± 23.0) with clinically significant changes in QLQ-C30 global health status (-13.0; n = 69) was seen by EOT. EQ-5D utility scores remained stable in patients with pNET and a moderate decrease was reported by patients with non-pNET.--NEW SECTION--The safety profile of everolimus was consistent with the previous studies without adversely affecting HRQOL in pNET. Lower baseline HRQOL scores and more frequent comorbidities might have contributed to the worse outcomes in non-pNET.--NEW SECTION--EudraCT no. 2010-023032-17.",eng,Targeted oncology,"Clinical Trial, Phase III",2025-04-23,2016

This paper identifies key factors for this achievement, and raises questions about prospective challenges for sustaining attention in the transition to the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, far broader in scope than the Millennium Development Goals.--NEW SECTION--This paper relies on participant observation methods and document analysis to develop a case study of the behaviours of global maternal and child health advocacy networks during 2005-2015.--NEW SECTION--The development of coordinated networks of heterogeneous actors facilitated the rise in attention to maternal and child health during the past 10 years. The strategic use of epidemiological and economic evidence by these networks enabled policy attention and promoted network cohesion. The time-bound opportunity of reaching the 2015 Millennium Development Goals created a window of opportunity for joint action. As the new post-2015 goals emerge, networks seek to sustain attention by repositioning their framing of issues, network structures, and external alliances, including with networks that lay both inside and outside of the health domain.--NEW SECTION--Issues rise on global policy agendas because of how ideas are constructed, portrayed and positioned by actors within given contexts. Policy networks play a critical role by uniting stakeholders to promote persuasive ideas about policy problems and solutions. The behaviours of networks in issue-framing, member-alignment, and strategic outreach can force open windows of opportunity for political attention -- or prevent them from closing.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27193200,10.1093/emph/eow013,The low prevalence of female smoking in the developing world: gender inequality or maternal adaptations for fetal protection?,"Female smoking prevalence is dramatically lower in developing countries (3.1%) than developed countries (17.2%), whereas male smoking is similar (32% vs 30.1%). Low female smoking has been linked to high gender inequality. Alternatively, to protect their offspring from teratogenic substances, pregnant and lactating women appear to have evolved aversions to toxic plant substances like nicotine, which are reinforced by cultural proscriptions. Higher total fertility rates (TFRs) in developing countries could therefore explain their lower prevalence of female smoking.--NEW SECTION--To compare the associations of TFR and gender inequality with national prevalence rates of female and male smoking.--NEW SECTION--Data from a previous study of smoking prevalence vs gender inequality in 74 countries were reanalysed with a regression model that also included TFR. We replicated this analysis with three additional measures of gender equality and 2012 smoking data from 173 countries.--NEW SECTION--A 1 SD increase in TFR predicted a decrease in female smoking prevalence by factors of 0.58-0.77, adjusting for covariates. TFR had a smaller and unexpected negative association with male smoking prevalence. Increased gender equality was associated with increased female smoking prevalence, and, unexpectedly, with decreased male smoking prevalence. TFR was also associated with an increase in smoking prevalence among postmenopausal women.--NEW SECTION--High TFR and gender inequality both predict reduced prevalence of female smoking across nations. In countries with high TFR, adaptations and cultural norms that protect fetuses from plant toxins might suppress smoking among frequently pregnant and lactating women.",eng,"Evolution, medicine, and public health",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Using World Health Organization data and program evaluation indicators collected by CDC in 2013, we retrospectively evaluated progress made 4-9 years after the start of influenza surveillance capacity strengthening in the countries. Our results showed substantial increases in laboratory and sentinel surveillance capacities, which are essential for knowing which influenza strains circulate globally, detecting emergence of novel influenza, identifying viruses for vaccine selection, and determining the epidemiology of respiratory illness. Twenty-eight of 35 countries responding to a 2013 questionnaire indicated that they have leveraged routine influenza surveillance platforms to detect other pathogens.

Of these, the early diagnostic can contribute to the decrease on renal, cardiovascular, and nervous systems complications. However, the diagnostic criteria, which are commonly used, do not suggest the diabetes progress in the patient. In this study, the streptozotocin model in mice (cDM) was used as early diagnostic criterion to reduce the side effects related to the illness. The results showed some clinical signs similarly to five-year diabetes progress without renal injury, neuropathies, and cardiac neuropathy autonomic in the cDM-model. On the other hand, the electrocardiogram was used to determine alterations in heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), using the Poincaré plot to quantify the HRV decrease in the cDM-model. Additionally, the SD1/SD2 ratio and ventricular arrhythmias showed increase without side effects of diabetes.

This paper presents key learnings from a combination of evaluation data from six population health short courses using a transformative learning framework from a 2010 independent international commission for health professionals that was designed to support the goals of transformative and interdependent health professionals. Participatory realist evaluation approaches and qualitative methods were used.--NEW SECTION--Evaluation findings reveal that there were mixed outcomes in facilitating participants' implementation of population health approaches, and their transformation into population health agents upon their return to their workplaces. Core enablers, barriers and requirements, at individual, organisational and system levels influence the capability of participants to implement population health approaches. The iterative and systemic evolution of the population health short courses, from a one off event to a program of inter-dependent modules, demonstrates sustained commitment by the short course developers and organisers to the promotion of transformative population health learning outcomes.--NEW SECTION--To leverage this commitment, recognising that professional development is not an event but part of an ongoing transformative process, suggestions to further align recognition of population health professional development programs are presented. Significance for public healthWith decreasing health and wellbeing of whole populations, increasing inequities among specific population groups, health professional educators are increasingly turning their attention to population health.

27187918,10.1111/mcn.12254,Rethinking policy perspectives on childhood stunting: time to formulate a structural and multifactorial strategy.,"Stunting and chronic undernutrition among children in South Asia remain a major unresolved global health issue. There are compelling intrinsic and moral reasons to ensure that children attain their optimal growth potential facilitated via promotion of healthy living conditions. Investments in efforts to ensure that children's growth is not faltered also have substantial instrumental benefits in terms of cognitive and economic development. Using the case of India, we critique three prevailing approaches to reducing undernutrition among children: an over-reliance on macroeconomic growth as a potent policy instrument, a disproportionate focus on interpreting undernutrition as a demand-side problem and an over-reliance on unintegrated single-factorial (one at a time) approaches to policy and research. Using existing evidence, we develop a case for support-led policy approach with a focus on integrated and structural factors to addressing the problem of undernutrition among children in India. Key messages Eliminating child undernutrition is important from an intrinsic perspective and offers considerable instrumental benefits to individual and society. Evidence suggests that an exclusive reliance on a growth-mediated strategy to eliminate stunting needs to be reconsidered, suggesting the need for a substantial support-led strategy. Interpreting and addressing undernutrition as a demand-side problem with proximal single-factorial interventions is futile. There is an urgent need to develop interventions that address the broader structural and upstream causes of child undernutrition.",eng,Maternal & child nutrition,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Stunting is the most prevalent form of child malnutrition with an estimated 161 million children worldwide in 2013 falling below -2 SD from the length-for-age/height-for-age World Health Organization Child Growth Standards median. Many more millions suffer from some degree of growth faltering as the entire length-for-age/height-for-age z-score distribution is shifted to the left indicating that all children, and not only those falling below a specific cutoff, are affected. Despite global consensus on how to define and measure it, stunting often goes unrecognized in communities where short stature is the norm as linear growth is not routinely assessed in primary health care settings and it is difficult to visually recognize it. Growth faltering often begins in utero and continues for at least the first 2 years of post-natal life. Linear growth failure serves as a marker of multiple pathological disorders associated with increased morbidity and mortality, loss of physical growth potential, reduced neurodevelopmental and cognitive function and an elevated risk of chronic disease in adulthood. The severe irreversible physical and neurocognitive damage that accompanies stunted growth poses a major threat to human development. Increased awareness of stunting's magnitude and devastating consequences has resulted in its being identified as a major global health priority and the focus of international attention at the highest levels with global targets set for 2025 and beyond.

To date, there is no licensed vaccine for HCV. The high viral replication rate and the existence of several HCV genotypes and quasispecies hamper the development of an effective universal vaccine. In this regard, the current HCV vaccine candidates show genotype-specific protection or narrow cross reactivity against other genotypes. Importantly, HCV spontaneous clearance occurs in 15-50 % of infected subjects, indicating that natural resistance to chronic infection exists. This phenomenon was demonstrated among humans and chimpanzees and continues to motivate researchers attempting to develop an effective HCV vaccine. However, what constitutes a protective immune response or correlate of protection against HCV infection is still vague. Additionally, the mechanisms behind successful HCV clearance suggest the coordination of several arms of the immune system, with cell-mediated immunity (CMI) playing a crucial role in this process. By contrast, although neutralizing antibodies have been identified, they are isolate-specific and poorly correlate with viral clearance. Antigen-specific CD4 T cells, instead, correlate with transient decline in HCV viremia and long-lasting control of the infection. Unfortunately, HCV has been very successful in evading host immune mechanisms, leading to complications such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Interestingly, CMI to HCV antigens were shown among exposed individuals without viremia or seroconversion, suggesting the clearance of prior HCV infection(s). These individuals include family members living with HCV-infected subjects, healthcare workers, IV drug users, and sexual contacts. The correlates of protection could be closely monitored among these individuals. This review provides a summary of HCV-specific immune responses in general and of CMI in particular in these cohorts. The importance of these CMI responses are discussed.",eng,Infectious agents and cancer,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Prevalence of clinically relevant depression across research sites varied widely, being consistently higher in women than in men. It was lowest in men from Brazil (6.3%) and highest in women from Albania (46.6%). Low education and insufficient income, living alone, multiple chronic conditions, and poor physical performance were all significantly associated with depression prevalence. Poor physical performance was more strongly associated with depression in men than in women. Similar factors are associated with clinically relevant depression among men and women and across research sites.

Current therapies are associated with significant side effects and even with combination therapy, progression, and recurrence is common. Our goal is to review the available published data available on light-emitting diode-generated (LED) red light phototherapy for treatment of skin fibrosis. A search of the published literature from 1 January 2000 to present on the effects of visible red light on skin fibrosis, and related pathways was performed in January 2016. A search of PubMed and EMBASE was completed using specific keywords and MeSH terms. ""Fibrosis"" OR ""skin fibrosis"" OR ""collagen"" was combined with (""light emitting diode,"" ""LED,"" ""laser,"" or ""red light""). The articles that were original research studies investigating the use of visible red light to treat skin fibrosis or related pathways were selected for inclusion. Our systematic search returned a total of 1376 articles. Duplicate articles were removed resulting in 1189 unique articles, and 133 non-English articles were excluded. From these articles, we identified six articles related to LED effects on skin fibrosis and dermal fibroblasts. We augmented our discussion with additional in vitro data on related pathways. LED phototherapy is an emerging therapeutic modality for treatment of skin fibrosis. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that visible LED light, especially in the red spectrum, is capable of modulating key cellular characteristic associated with skin fibrosis. We anticipate that as the understanding of LED-RL's biochemical mechanisms and clinical effects continue to advance, additional therapeutic targets in related pathways may emerge. We believe that the use of LED-RL, in combination with existing and new therapies, has the potential to alter the current treatment paradigm of skin fibrosis. There is a current lack of clinical trials investigating the efficacy of LED-RL to treat skin fibrosis. Randomized clinical trials are needed to demonstrate visible red light's clinical efficacy on different types of skin fibrosis.",eng,Current dermatology reports,Review,2025-04-23,2016

The present study evaluated the efficacy of the manual as a quality improvement strategy in diabetes care by PCPs.--NEW SECTION--A total of 42 PCPs in eight domestic districts of the Japan Medical Association were allocated to either the intervention group or the control group in a cluster-randomized design. The PCPs in both groups were provided with a copy of the Diabetes Treatment Guide published by the Japan Diabetes Society, and the PCPs in the intervention group additionally received a copy of the manual and a 30-min relevant seminar at the inception of the intervention. The primary end-point was the adherence to the following performances as quality indicators: evaluation of retinopathy, and urinary albumin excretion measurements and serum creatinine measurements, as recommended by the Japan Medical Association.--NEW SECTION--A total of 416 patients were enrolled by 36 PCPs. During the 1-year follow-up period, the proportion of PCPs who adhered to recommendation-concordant measurements of urinary albumin excretion was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (adherence: 17.9% vs 5.3%, P = 0.016). The other parameters were not statistically different between the two groups.--NEW SECTION--Implementation of 'The Standard Diabetes Manual' potentially leads to an improved quality of diabetes management by PCPs.",eng,Journal of diabetes investigation,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Antibiotic overuse has resulted in the natural evolution and selection of multi-drug resistant bacteria. One major public health threat, Clostridium difficile, is now the single leading cause of hospital-acquired bacterial infections and is by far the most deadly enteric pathogen for the U.S.--NEW SECTION--Due to the high morbidity and mortality and increasing incidence that coincides with antibiotic use, non-traditional therapeutics are ideal alternatives to current treatment methods and also provide an avenue towards prevention. Despite the need for alternative therapies to antibiotics and the safety of most probiotics on the market, researchers are inundated with regulatory issues that hinder the translational science required to push these therapies forward.

27178811,10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.05.012,Thermostabilization of inactivated polio vaccine in PLGA-based microspheres for pulsatile release.,"Vaccines are a critical clinical tool in preventing illness and death due to infectious diseases and are regularly administered to children and adults across the globe. In order to obtain full protection from many vaccines, an individual needs to receive multiple doses over the course of months. However, vaccine administration in developing countries is limited by the difficulty in consistently delivering a second or third dose, and some vaccines, including the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), must be injected more than once for efficacy. In addition, IPV does not remain stable over time at elevated temperatures, such as those it would encounter over time in the body if it were to be injected as a single-administration vaccine. In this manuscript, we describe microspheres composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) that can encapsulate IPV along with stabilizing excipients and release immunogenic IPV over the course of several weeks. Additionally, pH-sensitive, cationic dopants such as Eudragit E polymer caused clinically relevant amounts of stable IPV release upon degradation of the PLGA matrix. Specifically, IPV was released in two separate bursts, mimicking the delivery of two boluses approximately one month apart. In one of our top formulations, 1.4, 1.1, and 1.2 doses of the IPV serotype 1, 2, and 3, respectively, were released within the first few days from 50mg of particles. During the delayed, second burst, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.6 doses of each serotype, respectively, were released; thus, 50mg of these particles released approximately two clinical doses spaced a month apart. Immunization of rats with the leading microsphere formulation showed more robust and long-lasting humoral immune response compared to a single bolus injection and was statistically non-inferior from two bolus injections spaced 1 month apart. By minimizing the number of administrations of a vaccine, such as IPV, this technology can serve as a tool to aid in the eradication of polio and other infectious diseases for the improvement of global health.",eng,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

It will require training clinicians to see and act on structural barriers to health, to adapt imaginative structural approaches from fields outside of medicine, and to collaborate with disciplines and institutions outside of medicine. Case studies of effective work on all of these levels are presented in this volume. The contributors exemplify structural competency from many angles, from the implications of epigenetics for environmental intervention in personalized medicine to the ways clinicians can act on fundamental causes of disease, address abuses of power in clinical training, racially desegregate cities to reduce health disparities, address the systemic causes of torture by police, and implement harm-reduction programs for addiction in the face of punitive drug laws. Together, these contributors demonstrate the unique roles that clinicians can play in breaking systemic barriers to health and the benefit to the U.S. healthcare system of adopting innovations from outside of the United States and outside of clinical medicine.",eng,Journal of bioethical inquiry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Mobile health (mHealth)-based tools such as smartphone apps have been suggested as tools to support TB control efforts (eg, identification, contact tracing, case management including patient support).--NEW SECTION--The purpose of this review was to identify and assess the functionalities of mobile apps focused on prevention and treatment of TB.--NEW SECTION--We searched 3 online mobile app stores. Apps were included if they were focused on TB and were in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. For each included app, 11 functionalities were assessed (eg, inform, instruct, record), and searches were conducted to identify peer-review publications of rigorous testing of the available apps.--NEW SECTION--A total of 1332 potentially relevant apps were identified, with 24 meeting our inclusion criteria. All of the apps were free to download, but 7 required login and password and were developed for specific clinics, regional sites, or research studies. Targeted users were mainly clinicians (n=17); few (n=4) apps were patient focused. Most apps (n=17) had 4 or fewer functions out of 11 (range 1-6). The most common functionalities were inform and record (n=15). Although a number of apps were identified with various functionalities to support TB efforts, some had issues such as incorrect spelling and grammar, inconsistent responses to data entry, problems with crashing, or links to features that had no data. Of more concern, some apps provided potentially harmful information to patients, such as links to natural remedies for TB and natural healers. One-third of the apps (8/24) had not been updated for more than a year and may no longer be supported. Peer-reviewed publications were identified for only two of the included apps. In the gray literature (not found in the app stores), three TB-related apps were identified as in progress, being launched, or tested.--NEW SECTION--Apps identified for TB prevention and treatment had minimal functionality, primarily targeted frontline health care workers, and focused on TB information (eg, general information, guidelines, and news) or data collection (eg, replace paper-based notification or tracking). Few apps were developed for use by patients and none were developed to support TB patient involvement and management in their care (eg, follow-up alerts/reminders, side effects monitoring) or improve interaction with their health care providers, limiting the potential of these apps to facilitate patient-centered care. Our evaluation shows that more refined work is needed to be done in the area of apps to support patients with active TB. Involving TB patients in treatment in the design of these apps is recommended.",eng,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This study reports on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a self-management-based nutrition and exercise intervention for Australian cancer survivors. Adult survivors (n  =  25) during curative chemotherapy (stratum 1[S1]; n  =  11) or post-treatment (stratum 2 [S2]; n  =  14) were recruited prospectively from a single center. The Flinders Living Well Self-Management Program™ (FLW Program) was utilized to establish patient-led nutrition and exercise goals and develop a tailored 12-wk intervention plan. Fortnightly reviews occurred with assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 wk. A recruitment and retention rate of 38% and 84% were observed. Both strata maintained total skeletal muscle mass. Small reductions in body mass index, hip circumference, and percentage body fat, and small increases in hand grip strength and exercise capacity among subjects in both strata were observed. No significant differences were observed between strata; however, significant increases in exercise capacity and global health status for S2 were observed from baseline to 12 wk. FLW Program is a feasible mode of delivering nutrition and exercise intervention to cancer survivors and it appears that there are no barriers to implementing this program early during chemotherapy. Hence, the additive effect of gains achieved over a longer duration is promising and this should be explored in randomized controlled trials adequately powered to observe clinically and statistically significant improvements in relevant outcomes.",eng,Nutrition and cancer,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

With cardiovascular disease being the largest contributor to global mortality, accounting for nearly half of the 36 million annual noncommunicable disease deaths, achieving the 2025 goal requires that cardiovascular disease and its risk factors be aggressively addressed. The Global Cardiovascular Disease Taskforce, comprising the World Heart Federation, American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology Foundation, European Heart Network, and European Society of Cardiology, with expanded representation from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, along with global cardiovascular disease experts, disseminates information and approaches to reach the United Nations 2025 targets. The writing committee, which reflects Global Cardiovascular Disease Taskforce membership, engaged the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, to develop region-specific estimates of premature cardiovascular mortality in 2025 based on various scenarios. Results show that >5 million premature CVD deaths among men and 2.8 million among women are projected worldwide by 2025, which can be reduced to 3.5 million and 2.2 million, respectively, if risk factor targets for blood pressure, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, and obesity are achieved. However, global risk factor targets have various effects, depending on region. For most regions, United Nations targets for reducing systolic blood pressure and tobacco use have more substantial effects on future scenarios compared with maintaining current levels of body mass index and fasting plasma glucose. However, preventing increases in body mass index has the largest effect in some high-income countries. An approach achieving reductions in multiple risk factors has the largest impact for almost all regions. Achieving these goals can be accomplished only if countries set priorities, implement cost-effective population wide strategies, and collaborate in public-private partnerships across multiple sectors.",eng,Global heart,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Attention is particularly focused on helminth worm parasites, which are associated with protection from allergy and inflammation in both epidemiologic and laboratory settings. One mechanistic explanation of this is that helminths drive the regulatory arm of the immune system, abrogating the ability of the host to expel the parasites, while also dampening reactivity to many bystander specificities. Interest has therefore heightened into whether helminth parasites, or their products, hold therapeutic potential for immunologic disorders of the developed world. In this narrative review, progress across a range of trials is discussed, together with prospects for isolating individual molecular mediators from helminths that may offer defined new therapies for inflammatory conditions.",eng,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

All countries experience a gap between their population's health needs and what is economically feasible for governments to provide. Can priority setting ever be fair and ethically acceptable? Fairness requires that unmet health needs be addressed, but in a fair order. Three criteria for priority setting are widely accepted among ethicists: cost-effectiveness, priority to the worse-off, and financial risk protection. Thus, a fair health system will expand coverage for cost-effective services and give extra priority to those benefiting the worse-off, whilst at the same time providing high financial risk protection. It is considered unacceptable to treat people differently according to their gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, social status, or place of residence. Inequalities in health outcomes associated with such personal characteristics are therefore unfair and should be minimized. This commentary also discusses a third group of contested criteria, including rare diseases, small health benefits, age, and personal responsibility for health, subsequently rejecting them. In conclusion, countries need to agree on criteria and establish transparent and fair priority setting processes.",eng,BMC medicine,Editorial,2025-04-23,2016

The effects of CIM on quality of life (QOL) during chemotherapy need to be examined in varied socio-cultural settings. We purpose to explore the impact of CIM on QOL-related outcomes among Russian-speaking (RS) patients with cancer.--NEW SECTION--RS patients undergoing chemotherapy receiving standard supportive care were eligible. Patients in the treatment arm were seen by an integrative physician (IP) and treated within a patient-tailored CIM program. Symptoms and QOL were assessed at baseline, at 6, and at 12 weeks with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), the Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCAW) questionnaire, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).--NEW SECTION--Of 70 patients referred to the treatment arm, 50 (71.4 %) underwent IP assessment and CIM treatments. Of 51 referred to the control arm, 38 (76 %) agreed to participate. At 6 weeks, CIM-treated patients reported improved ESAS scores for fatigue (P = 0.01), depression (P = 0.048), appetite (P = 0.008), sleep (P < 0.0001), and general wellbeing (P = 0.004). No improvement was observed among controls. Between-group analysis found CIM-treated patients had improved sleep scores on ESAS (P = 0.019) and EORTC (P = 0.007) at 6 weeks.

Our aim was to develop a weighted network model to represent user activity on social health networks. This enabled us to accurately represent user interactions by relying on the data's semantic content. Our three-step method uses the weighted network model to represent user's activity, and network clustering and module analysis to characterize user interactions and extract further knowledge from user's posts. The network's topological properties reflect user activity such as posts' general topic as well as timing, while weighted edges reflect the posts semantic content and similarities among posts.

27163343,10.1002/14651858.CD011420.pub2,Lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay for detecting active tuberculosis in HIV-positive adults.,"Rapid detection of tuberculosis (TB) among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a global health priority. HIV-associated TB may have different clinical presentations and is challenging to diagnose. Conventional sputum tests have reduced sensitivity in HIV-positive individuals, who have higher rates of extrapulmonary TB compared with HIV-negative individuals. The lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay (LF-LAM) is a new, commercially available point-of-care test that detects lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a lipopolysaccharide present in mycobacterial cell walls, in people with active TB disease.--NEW SECTION--To assess the accuracy of LF-LAM for the diagnosis of active TB disease in HIV-positive adults who have signs and symptoms suggestive of TB (TB diagnosis).To assess the accuracy of LF-LAM as a screening test for active TB disease in HIV-positive adults irrespective of signs and symptoms suggestive of TB (TB screening).--NEW SECTION--We searched the following databases without language restriction on 5 February 2015: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE (PubMed,1966); EMBASE (OVID, from 1980); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED, from 1900), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S, from 1900), and BIOSIS Previews (from 1926) (all three using the Web of Science platform; MEDION; LILACS (BIREME, from 1982); SCOPUS (from 1995); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); the search portal of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP); and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&l (from 1861).--NEW SECTION--Eligible study types included randomized controlled trials, cross-sectional studies, and cohort studies that determined LF-LAM accuracy for TB against a microbiological reference standard (culture or nucleic acid amplification test from any body site). A higher quality reference standard was one in which two or more specimen types were evaluated for TB, and a lower quality reference standard was one in which only one specimen type was evaluated for TB. Participants were HIV-positive people aged 15 years and older.--NEW SECTION--Two review authors independently extracted data from each included study using a standardized form. We appraised the quality of studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. We evaluated the test at two different cut-offs: (grade 1 or 2, based on the reference card scale of five intensity bands). Most analyses used grade 2, the manufacturer's currently recommended cut-off for positivity. We carried out meta-analyses to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity using a bivariate random-effects model and estimated the models using a Bayesian approach. We determined accuracy of LF-LAM combined with sputum microscopy or Xpert® MTB/RIF. In addition, we explored the influence of CD4 count on the accuracy estimates. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.--NEW SECTION--We included 12 studies: six studies evaluated LF-LAM for TB diagnosis and six studies evaluated the test for TB screening. All studies were cross-sectional or cohort studies. Studies for TB diagnosis were largely conducted among inpatients (median CD4 range 71 to 210 cells per µL) and studies for TB screening were largely conducted among outpatients (median CD4 range 127 to 437 cells per µL). All studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries. Only two studies for TB diagnosis (33%) and one study for TB screening (17%) used a higher quality reference standard.LF-LAM for TB diagnosis (grade 2 cut-off): meta-analyses showed median pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% credible interval (CrI)) of 45% (29% to 63%) and 92% (80% to 97%), (five studies, 2313 participants, 35% with TB, low quality evidence). The pooled sensitivity of a combination of LF-LAM and sputum microscopy (either test positive) was 59% (47% to 70%), which represented a 19% (4% to 36%) increase over sputum microscopy alone, while the pooled specificity was 92% (73% to 97%), which represented a 6% (1% to 24%) decrease from sputum microscopy alone (four studies, 1876 participants, 38% with TB). The pooled sensitivity of a combination of LF-LAM and sputum Xpert® MTB/RIF (either test positive) was 75% (61% to 87%) and represented a 13% (1% to 37%) increase over Xpert® MTB/RIF alone. The pooled specificity was 93% (81% to 97%) and represented a 4% (1% to 16%) decrease from Xpert® MTB/RIF alone (three studies, 909 participants, 36% with TB). Pooled sensitivity and specificity of LF-LAM were 56% (41% to 70%) and 90% (81% to 95%) in participants with a CD4 count of less than or equal to 100 cells per µL (five studies, 859 participants, 47% with TB) versus 26% (16% to 46%) and 92% (78% to 97%) in participants with a CD4 count greater than 100 cells per µL (five studies, 1410 participants, 30% with TB).LF-LAM for TB screening (grade 2 cut-off): for individual studies, sensitivity estimates (95% CrI) were 44% (30% to 58%), 28% (16% to 42%), and 0% (0% to 71%) and corresponding specificity estimates were 95% (92% to 97%), 94% (90% to 97%), and 95% (92% to 97%) (three studies, 1055 participants, 11% with TB, very low quality evidence). There were limited data for additional analyses.The main limitations of the review were the use of a lower quality reference standard in most included studies, and the small number of studies and participants included in the analyses. The results should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.--NEW SECTION--We found that LF-LAM has low sensitivity to detect TB in adults living with HIV whether the test is used for diagnosis or screening. For TB diagnosis, the combination of LF-LAM with sputum microscopy suggests an increase in sensitivity for TB compared to either test alone, but with a decrease in specificity. In HIV-positive individuals with low CD4 counts who are seriously ill, LF-LAM may help with the diagnosis of TB.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Our results show that the mental state after an incomplete suicide attempt can present either a real desire for suicide or a desire for attention from relatives and rejection of life problems.--NEW SECTION--This study demonstrates that the mental states associated with specific diseases should not be ignored in evaluating health states. Although there are benefits to relying on expert panels and the general population in evaluating various health states, attention to the particular health states of the patients (taking into account their associated mental well-being) should also be utilized.",eng,International journal of high risk behaviors & addiction,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

With cardiovascular disease being the largest contributor to global mortality, accounting for nearly half of the 36 million annual noncommunicable disease deaths, achieving the 2025 goal requires that cardiovascular disease and its risk factors be aggressively addressed. The Global Cardiovascular Disease Taskforce, comprising the World Heart Federation, American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology Foundation, European Heart Network, and European Society of Cardiology, with expanded representation from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, along with global cardiovascular disease experts, disseminates information and approaches to reach the United Nations 2025 targets. The writing committee, which reflects Global Cardiovascular Disease Taskforce membership, engaged the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, to develop region-specific estimates of premature cardiovascular mortality in 2025 based on various scenarios. Results show that >5 million premature CVD deaths among men and 2.8 million among women are projected worldwide by 2025, which can be reduced to 3.5 million and 2.2 million, respectively, if risk factor targets for blood pressure, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, and obesity are achieved. However, global risk factor targets have various effects, depending on region. For most regions, United Nations targets for reducing systolic blood pressure and tobacco use have more substantial effects on future scenarios compared with maintaining current levels of body mass index and fasting plasma glucose. However, preventing increases in body mass index has the largest effect in some high-income countries. An approach achieving reductions in multiple risk factors has the largest impact for almost all regions. Achieving these goals can be accomplished only if countries set priorities, implement cost-effective population wide strategies, and collaborate in public-private partnerships across multiple sectors.",eng,Circulation,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Thus, the weight-reducing function of tea has attracted considerable attention. This study investigated the anti-obesity effect and the mechanism of black tea (BT) polyphenols and polysaccharides in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The BT polyphenols and polysaccharides reduced the body weight, Lee's index, visceral fat weight, and fat cell size but improved the biochemical profile and increased the fecal fatty acid content, thereby preventing high-fat diet-induced obesity. A gene expression profile array was used to screen eight upregulated and five downregulated differentially expressed genes that affect fat metabolic pathways, such as glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty acid degradation, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, bile and pancreatic secretion, the insulin signaling pathway, and steroid hormone secretion.

Members of the International Society for Burn Injuries (ISBI) Rehabilitation Committee conducted a needs assessment survey in order to characterize how burn rehabilitation is implemented worldwide and how the international burn rehabilitation community can help improve burn rehabilitation in identified geographic locations which need assistance in rehabilitating burn survivors successfully. The results of this survey indicated that poor and in some cases resource limited environments (RLEs) around the world seem to lack the financial, educational and material resources to conduct burn rehabilitation successfully. It appears that there are vast discrepancies in the areas of education, training and capacity to conduct research to improve the care of burn survivors as evidenced by the variation in responses between the RLEs and developed countries around the globe. In some cases, the problem is not knowledge, skill and ability to practice burn rehabilitation, but rather having the resources to do so due to financial difficulties.",eng,Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This type of serious injury - one that is particularly devastating in LMICs - is preventable. To further explore the effectiveness of burn prevention strategies in LMICs, we performed a systematic review of the literature indexed in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Global Health, and the Cochrane Library databases as of October 2015. Our search resulted in 12,568 potential abstracts. Through multiple rounds of screening using criteria determined a priori, 11 manuscripts were identified for inclusion. The majority of these studies demonstrate reductions in hazardous behaviors, incidence of burns, morbidity, and mortality using educational programs, but also highlight other initiatives, such as media campaigns, as effective strategies. Given that only 11 manuscripts are highlighted in this review, it is evident that original research is lacking. Further studies of preventative efforts tailored to populations in LMICs are needed. It is also essential that these studies be founded in population-based epidemiology and use meaningful end points, such as reductions in incidence, morbidity, and mortality.",eng,Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Huge research efforts focused on gene expression, cellular signalling and metabolism in obesity have improved our understanding of these disorders; nevertheless, to bridge the gap between the regulation of gene expression and changes in signalling/metabolism, protein levels must be assessed. We have extensively analysed visceral adipose tissue from age-, T2DM- and gender-matched obese patients using high-throughput proteomics and systems biology methods to identify new biomarkers for the onset of T2DM in obesity, as well as to gain insight into the influence of aging and gender in these disorders. About 250 proteins showed significant abundance differences in the age, T2DM and gender comparisons. In diabetic patients, remarkable gender-specific hallmarks were discovered regarding redox status, immune response and adipose tissue accumulation. Both aging and T2DM processes were associated with mitochondrial remodelling, albeit through well-differentiated proteome changes. Systems biology analysis highlighted mitochondrial proteins that could play a key role in the age-dependent pathophysiology of T2DM.

Our objective was to systematically evaluate the current literature on surgical volunteering trips to measure their adherence to WHO CHOosing Interventions that are cost-effective (WHO-CHOICE). We hypothesized that the majority of studies use some type of cost-effectiveness analysis that do not adhere to these standards.--NEW SECTION--A systematic review of Pubmed, Medline, and Embase databases was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, with inclusion criteria set a priori. Of the 908 publications screened, 72 were selected for full text review; 17 met inclusion criteria.--NEW SECTION--Only 17 out of 72 studies reported some type of economic analysis. We categorized the studies into service, educational, and combination (service and educational) surgical trips. Although seven of the service studies calculated the cost per disability-adjusted life year averted, the results were not based on WHO-CHOICE standards to facilitate comparisons among alternative options. Furthermore, none of the three educational trips calculated the value of the education provided, but only published cost estimates of the resources used during the trip.--NEW SECTION--Although a few studies performed some type of economic analysis, owing to their non-adherence to WHO-CHOICE standards, the results were not comparable to other studies. International surgical trips are expensive. To improve the efficacy and optimal use of limited resources, studies on surgical trips should follow the guidelines set by the WHO-CHOICE.",eng,World journal of surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

I argue that a short-term surge in funding provided by GHIs between 2008 and 2010 exacerbated preexisting conflicts between NGOs by promoting a neoliberal process in which the state outsourced public health services to civil society organizations, deliberately encouraging a climate of competition among NGOs. I also show how GHIs encouraged the bureaucratization and medicalization of one grassroots gay NGO, channeling its activities away from broader political and social objectives and compelling the group to develop a narrower and more entrepreneurial emphasis on HIV testing and treatment. This article contributes to a deeper ethnographic understanding of the complex and perhaps unintended consequences of GHIs.",eng,Medical anthropology quarterly,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Cases in infected travellers have been reported in a number of other African countries, as well as in China, representing the first ever documented cases of yellow fever in Asia. There is a large Chinese workforce in Angola, many of whom may be unvaccinated, increasing the risk of ongoing importation of yellow fever into Asia via busy commercial airline routes. Large parts of the region are hyperendemic for the related Flavivirus dengue and are widely infested by Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of urban yellow fever transmission. The combination of sustained introduction of viraemic travellers, an ecology conducive to local transmission, and an unimmunized population raises the possibility of a yellow fever epidemic in Asia. This represents a major global health threat, particularly in the context of a depleted emergency vaccine stockpile and untested surveillance systems in the region. In this review, the potential for a yellow fever outbreak in Asia is discussed with reference to the ecological and historical forces that have shaped global yellow fever epidemiology.

Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 101 professionals based in each country, Washington DC and Geneva between October 2012 and June 2013, the paper makes four key arguments. First, partnership has a legitimating function in global health policy processes for international development institutions, government agencies and civil society organisations alike. Second, the practice of partnership generates idiosyncratic and complicated relationships that health professionals have to manage and navigate, often informally. Third, partnership is shaped by historical legacies, critical events, and independent consultants. Fourth, despite being an accepted part of global health policy, there is little shared understanding of what good partnership is meant to include or resemble in practice. Knowing more about the specific socio-cultural and political dynamics of partnership in different health system contexts is critical to equip health professionals with the skills to build the informal relations that are essential to effective partnership engagement.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Hemodialysis (HD) is the most commonly used strategy for treating uremic patients; however, the patients still have a high risk of suffering various complications. It is well recognized that lipid disorder usually occurs in maintenance HD patients. To systemically study the effects of HD on lipid metabolism associated with uremia, we employed an ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS)-based lipidomics method. A total of 87 human plasma samples from patients with prehemodialysis (pre-HD)/posthemodialysis (post-HD) treatment and the healthy controls were enrolled in the study. As compared with pre-HD patients, many plasma lipids showed significant changes (p < 0.05) in patients receiving HD therapy. Specifically, sum of free fatty acids (FFA) as well as saturated FFA and eicosanoids and sums of lyso-phosphatidylinositols and lyso-phosphatidylethanolamines, FFA 16:1/FFA 16:0, and FFA 18:1/FFA 18:0 were obviously higher in the pre-HD group than in the controls while they were significantly lower in patients after HD.

Inadequate nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent conditions that adversely affect global health. Although improvements in diet quality are essential to address these issues, dietary supplements and/or food fortification could help meet requirements for individuals at risk of deficiencies. For example, supplementation with vitamin A and iron in developing countries, where women of reproductive age, infants and children often have deficiencies; with folic acid among women of reproductive age and during pregnancy; with vitamin D among infants and children; and with calcium and vitamin D to ensure bone health among adults aged ≥65 years. Intense debate surrounds the benefits of individual high-dose micronutrient supplementation among well-nourished individuals because the alleged beneficial effects on chronic diseases are not consistently supported. Daily low-dose multivitamin supplementation has been linked to reductions in the incidence of cancer and cataracts, especially among men. Baseline nutrition is an important consideration in supplementation that is likely to modify its effects.

27150250,10.1186/s12936-016-1317-3,Cysteamine broadly improves the anti-plasmodial activity of artemisinins against murine blood stage and cerebral malaria.,"The potential emergence and spread of resistance to artemisinins in the Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite constitutes a major global health threat. Hence, improving the efficacy of artemisinins and of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) represents a major short-term goal in the global fight against malaria. Mice defective in the enzyme pantetheinase (Vnn3) show increased susceptibility to blood-stage malaria (increased parasitaemia, reduced survival), and supplementation of Vnn3 mutants with the reaction product of pantetheinase, cysteamine, corrects in part the malaria-susceptibility phenotype of the mutants. Cysteamine (Cys) is a small, naturally occurring amino-thiol that has very low toxicity in vivo and is approved for clinical use in the life-long treatment of the kidney disorder nephropathic cystinosis.--NEW SECTION--The ability of Cys to improve the anti-plasmodial activity of different clinically used artemisinins was tested. The effect of different CYS/ART combinations on malarial phenotypes (parasite blood-stage replication, overall and survival from lethal infection) was assessed in a series of in vivo experiments using Plasmodium strains that induce either blood-stage (Plasmodium chabaudi AS) or cerebral disease (Plasmodium berghei ANKA). This was also evaluated in an ex vivo experimental protocol that directly assesses the effect of such drug combinations on the viability of Plasmodium parasites, as measured by the ability of tested parasites to induce a productive infection in vivo in otherwise naïve animals.--NEW SECTION--Cys is found to potentiate the anti-plasmodial activity of artesunate, artemether, and arteether, towards the blood-stage malaria parasite P. chabaudi AS. Ex vivo experiments, indicate that potentiation of the anti-plasmodial activity of artemisinins by Cys is direct and does not require the presence of host factors. In addition, potentiation occurs at sub-optimal concentrations of artemisinins and Cys that on their own have little or no effect on parasite growth. Cys also dramatically enhances the efficacy and protective effect of artemisinins against cerebral malaria induced by infection with the P. berghei ANKA parasite.--NEW SECTION--These findings indicate that inclusion of Cys in current formulations of ACT, or its use as adjunct therapy could improve the anti-plasmodial activity of artemisinin, decrease mortality in cerebral malaria patients, and prevent or delay the development and spread of artemisinin resistance.",eng,Malaria journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Less attention has been devoted to developing expertise about social, economic, and political contexts that produce ill health around the world. The purpose of this article is to offer a transnational feminist critique of the World Development Report: Gender Equality and Development and to illuminate implications such reports may have in the lives of the world's most marginalized women and girls. We examine the political economy idealized in the report, raising questions about the capitalist framework underpinning its agenda. Second, we examine the assumptive language used in the report, suggesting that it discursively constructs a problematic representation of women in low-income countries. We contend that the report perpetuates a hegemonic discourse of patriarchy and inequality for women in the Global South through the use of an uncontested economic framework and universalist reasoning. We conclude the article with discussion about a transformative policy making that could be more inclusive of the wisdoms, values, and everyday experiences of women living in the Global South and about the vital role nurses can play in advancing gender equity through their active collaboration in policy critique and policy formulation.",eng,ANS.

27148490,10.3389/fcimb.2016.00041,Local and Long-Distance Calling: Conversations between the Gut Microbiota and Intra- and Extra-Gastrointestinal Tract Infections.,"Preservation of health from infectious diseases depends upon both mucosal and systemic immunity via the collaborative effort of innate and adaptive immune responses. The proficiency of host immunity stems from robust defense mechanisms--physical barriers and specialized immune cells--and a failure of these mechanisms leads to pathology. Intriguingly, immunocompetence to pathogens can be shaped by the gut microbiome as recent publications highlight a dynamic interplay between the gut microbiome and host susceptibility to infection. Modulation of host immunity to enteric pathogens has long been studied where gut bacteria shape multiple facts of both innate and adaptive immunity. Conversely, the impact of gut commensals on host immunity to extra-gastrointestinal (GI) tract infections has only recently been recognized. In this context, the gut microbiome can augment host immunity to extra-GI tract bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. This review explores the research that affords insight into the role of the gut microbiome in various infectious diseases, with a particular emphasis on extra-GI tract infections. A better understanding of the link between the gut microbiome and infectious disease will be critical for improving global health in the years ahead.",eng,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27147683,10.2106/JBJS.15.00623,Clinical Outcomes and Development of Symptomatic Osteoarthritis 2 to 24 Years After Surgical Treatment of Tarsometatarsal Joint Complex Injuries.,"Injuries to the tarsometatarsal (TMT) joint complex, or Lisfranc injuries, have been reported to result in osteoarthritis (OA) following surgical treatment. Good outcomes with respect to short and medium-term results have been reported. However, long-term results, specifically regarding clinical outcomes and the development of symptomatic OA, are limited. The objectives of this study were to assess clinical outcomes, the occurrence of symptomatic OA, and risk factors for OA at 2 to 24 years after a Lisfranc injury treated surgically with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) or with primary arthrodesis.--NEW SECTION--This was a retrospective study involving 61 patients treated surgically at our institution between 1988 and 2009 for an injury to the TMT joint complex. Patients underwent either ORIF with transarticular screws or primary arthrodesis when joint comminution at the TMT level was such that ORIF was not possible. Functional outcomes were assessed according to the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, the Foot Function Index (FFI), and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Global health was evaluated with the Short Form (SF)-12 Health Survey physical component summary (PCS).--NEW SECTION--Sixty-one of the 128 patients were available for clinical evaluation, including the use of questionnaires, and radiographic assessment at a mean of 10.9 years postoperatively (range, 2.4 to 23.9 years). Mean scores were as follows: AOFAS score, 79.0; FFI, 16.9, and VAS for pain, 2.5. Radiographic evidence of OA was noted in 44 (72.1%) of the patients, and symptomatic OA, in 54.1%, the latter having worse outcomes. Risk factors for OA were nonanatomic reduction, fracture classification of Myerson type C, and a history of smoking.--NEW SECTION--Two to 24 years following surgical treatment to restore and maintain joint anatomy for Lisfranc injuries, we found satisfactory clinical outcome scores and a large number of patients who had returned to their previous level of functioning and employment, with little need for secondary procedures. However, there was a substantial occurrence of posttraumatic OA, as evident on radiographs, albeit the occurrence of symptomatic OA was lower.--NEW SECTION--Therapeutic Level IV.

Exclusion criteria were known distant metastases, pre surgical therapy, and/or previous breast cancer. Data on age, type of surgery, global health, and work environment were included as covariates in multivariable logistic regression analysis.--NEW SECTION--Five percent of the women had not received any advice concerning work or sick leave. Women reporting receiving useful advice or support related to paid work had lower risk of reporting reduced physical or psychological/social work capacity due to the cancer or treatment (OR 0.46 (95 % CI 0.26-0.81) respective OR 0.45 (95 % CI 0.26-0.77)). There were no associations between having received useful advice or support concerning work and being on sick leave. Women encouraged to take sick leave had an OR of 2.17 (95 % CI 1.39-3.37) of being sickness absent. They also to a higher extent had reduced physical and psychological/social work capacity. Women who reported to have been encouraged to work were sickness absent to a lower extent (OR 0.64; 95 % CI 0.41-0.98) and reported higher physical work capacity.--NEW SECTION--Work and sick leave is being discussed during consultations with women with breast cancer and the advice given seems to be in line with the women's subjective work capacity.",eng,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Both approaches have historical roots in French colonialism and have led to successes and failures that continue until the present day. In this paper, the second in The Lancet's Series on France, we look at how this tension has evolved. During the French colonial period (1890s to 1950s), the Indigenous Medical Assistance structure was supposed to bring metropolitan France's model of universal and free public health care to the colonies, and French State imperial humanitarianism crystallised in vertical programmes inspired by Louis Pasteur, while vying with early private humanitarian activism in health represented by Albert Schweitzer. From decolonisation to the end of the Cold War (1960-99), French assistance to newly independent states was affected by sans frontièrisme, Health for All, and the AIDS pandemic. Since 2000, France has had an active role in development of global health initiatives and favoured multilateral action for health assistance. Today, with adoption of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the challenges of non-communicable diseases, economic inequality, and climate change, French international health assistance needs new direction. In the context of current debate over global health as a universal goal, understanding and acknowledging France's history could help strengthen advocacy in favour of universal health coverage and contribute to advancing global equity through income redistribution, from healthy populations to people who are sick and from wealthy individuals to those who are poor.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27144643,10.1002/hpm.2356,Where there is no policy: governing the posting and transfer of primary health care workers in Nigeria.,"The posting and transfer of health workers and managers receives little policy and research attention in global health. In Nigeria, there is no national policy on posting and transfer in the health sector. We sought to examine how the posting and transfer of frontline primary health care (PHC) workers is conducted in four states (Lagos, Benue, Nasarawa and Kaduna) across Nigeria, where public sector PHC facilities are usually the only form of formal health care service providers available in many communities. We conducted in-depth interviews with PHC workers and managers, and group discussions with community health committee members. The results revealed three mechanisms by which PHC managers conduct posting and transfer: (1) periodically moving PHC workers around as a routine exercise aimed at enhancing their professional experience and preventing them from being corrupted; (2) as a tool for improving health service delivery by assigning high-performing PHC workers to PHC facilities perceived to be in need, or posting PHC workers nearer their place of residence; and (3) as a response to requests for punishment or favour from PHC workers, political office holders, global health agencies and community health committees. Given that posting and transfer is conducted by discretion, with multiple influences and sometimes competing interests, we identified practices that may lead to unfair treatment and inequities in the distribution of PHC workers. The posting and transfer of PHC workers therefore requires policy measures to codify what is right about existing informal practices and to avert their negative potential. © 2016 The Authors The International Journal of Health Planning and Management Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",eng,The International journal of health planning and management,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

These disorders have the potential to affect all members of society, regardless of age, gender, race, creed, color or socioeconomic status. Improving our understanding of functional bowel disorders (FBD) is critical as they impose a negative economic impact to the global health care system in addition to reducing quality of life. Research in the basic and clinical sciences during the past decade has produced new information on the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of FBDs. These important findings created a need to revise the Rome III criteria for FBDs, last published in 2006. This manuscript classifies the FBDs into five distinct categories: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); functional constipation (FC); functional diarrhea (FDr); functional abdominal bloating/distention (FAB/D); and unspecified FBD (U-FBD). Also included in this article is a new sixth category, opioid induced constipation (OIC) which is distinct from the functional bowel disorders (FBDs). Each disorder will first be defined, followed by sections on epidemiology, rationale for changes from prior criteria, clinical evaluation, physiologic features, psychosocial features and treatment.

A new vision for nurses involves active participation and collaboration with international colleagues across research practice and policy domains. Nursing can embrace new concepts and a new approach-""One World, One Health""-to animate nursing engagement in global health, as it is uniquely positioned to participate in novel ways to improve healthcare for the well-being of the global community. This opinion paper takes a historical and reflective approach to inform and inspire nurses to engage in global health practice, research, and policy to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It can be argued that a colonial perspective currently informs scholarship pertaining to nursing global health engagement. The notion of unidirectional relationships where those with resources support training of those less fortunate has dominated the framing of nursing involvement in low- and middle-income countries. This paper suggests moving beyond this conceptualization to a more collaborative and equitable approach that positions nurses as cocreators and brokers of knowledge.

Disparities between high-income countries (HICs) and low/middle-income countries (LMICs) in the magnitude of HIV-related OIs in pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) populations was reviewed, and HAART-induced decline in OIs was further compared between the two settings. Studies published in English from onset of HIV epidemic up to December 2013 were searched in PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, and African Journal online. An article was included if (a) the study was conducted in HIC or LMIC, (b) the age of the participants was ≥12 years, (c) the HAART status of the participants was stated, and (d) various types of OIs were investigated. In predominantly pre-HAART populations, the incidence and prevalence of overall HIV-related OIs in HIC ranged from 5.5 to 50.0 per 100 person-years (PY) and 27.4-56.7%, respectively. In LMIC, the respective overall incidence and prevalence of OIs were 12.2-93.9 per 100 PY and 32.0-77.7%. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, candidiasis, Cytomegalovirus disease, Mycobacterium avium complex disease, and Kaposi's sarcoma were the most frequent OIs in HICs while tuberculosis, candidiasis, chronic diarrhea, and cryptococcosis were predominant in LMICs. The introduction of HAART led to substantial reduction in the incidence of OIs with more impressive percentage decline in HICs (43-97%) compared to 30-79% in LMICs. Disparities in the magnitude of HIV-related OIs between HICs and LMICs are evident both in the pre-HAART and post-HAART era.

For example, PMH explains that to be happy or resilient can drive us to live a full life, giving us a perception of well-being and robustness against everyday problems. Moreover, PMH can help people to avoid risky behaviours like tobacco consumption (TC). Our hypothesis was that PMH is negatively associated with TC, and this association differs across rural, urban and migrant populations.--NEW SECTION--A cross-sectional study was conducted using the PERU MIGRANT Study's dataset, including rural population from the Peruvian highlands (n = 201), urban population from the capital city Lima (n = 199) and migrants who were born in highlands but had to migrated because of terrorism (n = 589). We used an adapted version of the 12-item Global Health Questionnaire to measure PMH. The outcome was TC, measured as lifetime and recent TC. Log-Poisson robust regression, performed with a Maximum Likelihood method, was used to estimate crude prevalence ratios (PR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95%CI), adjusted by sex, age, family income and education which were the confounders. The modelling procedure included the use of LR Test, Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criteria (BIC).--NEW SECTION--Cumulative occurrence of tobacco use (lifetime TC) was 61.7 % in the rural group, 78 % in the urban group and 76.2 % in rural-to-urban migrants. Recent TC was 35.3 % in the rural group, 30.7 % in the urban group and 20.5 % in rural-to-urban migrants. After adjusting for confounders, there was evidence of a negative association between PMH and lifetime TC in the rural group (PR = 0.93; 95%CI: 0.87-0.99), and a positive association between PMH and recent TC in migrants (PR = 1.1; 95%CI: 1.0-1.3).--NEW SECTION--PMH was negatively associated with TC in rural participants only. Urbans exhibited just a similar trend, while migrants exhibited the opposite one. This evidence represents the first step in the route of knowing the potential of PMH for fighting against TC. For rural populations, this study supplies new information that could support decisions about prevention programmes and psychotherapy for smoking cessation.

A significant part of health budget in all countries has been allocated to treat the cancer, which is incurable in many cases. It has led the global health attitude to cancer prevention. Many cancer-related risk factors have been identified for which preventive recommendations have been offered by international organizations such as World Health Organization. Some of the most important of these risk factors are smoking and alcohol consumption, hypercaloric and low-fiber diet, obesity, inactivity, environmental and industrial pollution, some viral infections, and hereditary factors. Exact reviewing of Iranian-Islamic traditional medicine (IITM) resources determines that preventive rules, which named as six essential rules (Sitteh-e-Zarurieah) are abundantly found, including all identified cancer-related risk factors. These preventive rules are: Air (Hava), body movement and repose, sleep and wakefulness, food and drink, evacuation and retention, and mental movement and repose (A'raz-e-Nafsani). The associated risk factors in classic medicine are: Smoking and air pollution, sedentary life, sleep disturbance, improper nutrition and alcohol, chronic constipation, and psychoneurotic stresses. Moreover, these rules are comprehensive enough to include many of the other harmful health-related factors whose roles have been confirmed in the occurrence of different diseases, except cancer.

We examined whether PEPFAR funding for abstinence and faithfulness programs, which aimed to reduce the risk of HIV transmission, was associated with a relative change in five outcomes indicative of high-risk sexual behavior: number of sexual partners in the past twelve months for men and for women, age at first sexual intercourse for men and for women, and teenage pregnancies. Using nationally representative surveys from twenty-two sub-Saharan African countries, we compared trends between people living in countries that received PEPFAR abstinence and faithfulness funding and those living in countries that did not in the period 1998-2013. We found no evidence to suggest that PEPFAR funding was associated with population-level reductions in any of the five outcomes.

The main outcome variable in our analysis, the first of its kind using these data, was the share of PEPFAR's total annual budget for a country that was designated for governance and systems. The share of planned PEPFAR funding for governance and systems increased from 14.9 percent, on average, in 2004 to 27.5 percent in 2013, but it declined in 2014 to 20.8 percent. This study shows that the size of a country's PEPFAR budget was negatively associated with the share allocated for governance and systems (compared with other budget program areas); it also shows that there was no significant relationship between budgets for governance and systems and HIV prevalence.

We examined the distributional aspects of health financing and delivery and assessed financial protection in Malaysia's hybrid system. We found that this system has been effective for many decades in equalizing health care use and providing protection from financial risk, despite modest government spending. Our results also indicate that a high out-of-pocket share of total financing is not a consistent proxy for financial protection; greater attention is needed to the absolute level of out-of-pocket spending.

Most malaria control programs use insecticides for controlling mosquito populations. Large scale usage of these insecticides exerts massive selection pressure on mosquitoes resulting in insecticide resistant mosquito breeds. Thus, developing alternative strategies are crucial for sustainable malaria control. Here, we explore the usefulness of an alternative strategy, paratransgenesis: the introduction of genetically engineered plasmodium killing bacteria inside the mosquito gut. The genetically modified bacterial culture is housed in cotton balls dipped in a sugar solution (sugar bait) and they enter a mosquito's midgut when it drinks from a sugar bait. We study scenarios where vectors and hosts mix homogeneously as well as heterogeneously and calculate the amount of baits required to prevent a malaria outbreak. Given the baits are attractive, we show that the basic reproductive number drops rapidly with the increase in bait density. Furthermore, we propose a targeted bait distribution strategy for minimizing the reproductive number for the heterogeneous case. Our results can prove to be useful for designing future experiments and field trials of alternative malaria control mechanisms and they also have implications on the development of malaria control programs.",eng,Mathematical biosciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This study evaluated the immunogenicity of a recombinant fusion protein consisting of early secreted antigenic target protein 6 kDa (ESAT-6), culture filtrate protein 10 kDa (CFP-10) and the Fc-domain of mouse IgG2a as a novel subunit vaccine. The recombinant expression vectors (pPICZαA-ESAT-6:CFP-10:Fcγ2a and pPICZαA-ESAT-6:CFP-10:His) were transferred into Pichia pastoris. After SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, the immunogenicity of the recombinant proteins was evaluated in mice. When both recombinant proteins (ESAT-6:CFP-10:Fcγ2a and ESAT-6:CFP-10:His) were used for vaccination, Th1-type cellular responses were induced producing high levels of IFN-γ and IL-12. However, the Fc-tagged recombinant protein induced more effective Th1-type cellular responses with a small increase in IL-4 as compared to the BCG and ESAT-6:CFP-10:His groups. Moreover, mice primed with BCG and then supplemented with ESAT-6:CFP-10:Fcγ2a produced the highest levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 in immunized groups. The findings indicate that when Fcγ2a is fused to the ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex, as a delivery vehicle, there could be an increase in the immunogenicity of this type of subunit vaccine. Therefore, additional investigations are necessary for the development of appropriate Fc-based tuberculosis vaccines.",eng,Molecular bioSystems,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27137528,10.1007/s13346-016-0293-z,Nano-ART and NeuroAIDS.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a neurotropic virus that enters the central nervous system (CNS) early in the course of infection. Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in remarkable decline in the morbidity and mortality in AIDS patients, controlling HIV infections still remains a global health priority. HIV access to the CNS serves as the natural viral preserve because most antiretroviral (ARV) drugs possess inadequate or zero delivery across the brain barriers. The structure of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the presence of efflux pumps, and the expression of metabolic enzymes pose hurdles for ARV drug-brain entry. Thus, development of target-specific, effective, safe, and controllable drug delivery approach is an important health priority for global elimination of AIDS progression. Nanoformulations can circumvent the BBB to improve CNS-directed drug delivery by affecting such pumps and enzymes. Alternatively, they can be optimized to affect their size, shape, and protein and lipid coatings to facilitate drug uptake, release, and ingress across the barrier. Improved drug delivery to the CNS would affect pharmacokinetic and drug biodistribution properties. This review focuses on how nanotechnology can serve to improve the delivery of antiretroviral medicines, termed NanoART, across the BBB and affect the biodistribution and clinical benefit for NeuroAIDS.",eng,Drug delivery and translational research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

While the origins of such outbreaks remain poorly understood, it is very important to identify the precipitating factors in their emergence so that future pandemics can be detected as quickly as possible. Methords: Descriptive epidemiology was used to analyse the association between influenza pandemics and possible pandemics and relative number of sunspots. Non-conditional logistic regression was performed to analyse the statistical association between sunspot extremes and influenza pandemics to within plus or minus 1 year.--NEW SECTION--Almost all recorded influenza/possible pandemics have occurred in time frames corresponding to sunspot extremes, or +/- 1 year within such extremes. These periods were identified as important risk factors in both possible and confirmed influenza pandemics (odds ratio: 3.87; 95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 13.85).--NEW SECTION--Extremes of sunspot activity to within plus or minus 1 year may precipitate influenza pandemics. Mechanisms of epidemic initiation and early spread are discussed including primary causation by externally derived viral variants (from space via cometary dust). Efforts to construct a comprehensive early warning system for potential influenza and other viral pandemics that include analysis of sunspot activity and stratospheric sampling for viral variants should be supported.

To increase access to Hib vaccine, GAVI - the Vaccine Alliance - has provided financial support for 73 lower income countries worldwide. At the same time, GAVI has been implementing its co-financing policy, requiring recipient countries to pay a portion of vaccine costs and to increase this amount over time. Starting in 2016, 5 countries will stop receiving GAVI funding and procure the vaccine themselves. Although the graduating countries have access to the UNICEF/GAVI tendered vaccine price for 5 more years, the uncertainty in market vaccine price may hamper the post-GAVI program sustainability. A possible increase in vaccine price would cause a significant burden on governmental budgets, discouraging countries to continue the program. As a special tool, economic evaluation (EE) can assist decision makers by identifying the maximum affordable vaccine price for countries to pay. Given that only 6 GAVI-eligible countries have such analyses published, more EEs are necessary to strengthen countries' commitment during this transition period. The information will also be useful for manufacturers to determine their pricing policy.",eng,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Regression models were estimated using telephone and self-administered questionnaire data from 1080 married men and women who participated in the National Survey of Midlife in the U.S. (MIDUS) 2005. Although providing filial care was not found to be a global health risk for all married caregivers, marital strain was a critical factor in determining risk. Contrary to hypothesis, robust gender differences were not in evidence. But among both women and men, caregiving for a parent in the presence of high levels of marital strain was associated with significantly poorer health across all four evaluated outcomes.",eng,Journal of family issues,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Current official approaches reflect ambivalence about how health policy should approach the social determinants of health identified by the WHO Commission on the topic that released its report in 2008, and in particular the role of macro-scale economic and social processes. Authoritative framing of options for NCD prevention in advance of the September, 2011 UN high-level meeting on NCDs arguably relied on a selective reading of the scientific (including social scientific) evidence, and foregrounded a limited number of risk factors defined in terms of individual behavior: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, alcohol (ab)use and physical inactivity. The effect was to reproduce at a transnational level the individualization of responsibility for health that characterizes most health promotion initiatives in high-income countries, ignoring both the limited control that many people have over their exposure to these risk factors and the contribution of macro-scale processes like trade liberalization and the marketing activities of transnational corporations to the global burden of NCDs.

Although accumulating evidence supports a role for angiogenesis responses to arsenic in the pathogenesis of the cardiovascular disease, the detailed molecular mechanism is not well understood. We aimed to determine the role and mechanism of microRNA (miRNA) in arsenic-induced angiogenesis. In our present study, sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) inhibited angiogenesis by decreasing cells proliferation, migration and tube formation in HUVECs. After NaAsO2 treatment, we found the expression of microRNA-425-5p (miR-425-5p) was reduced in vitro and in vivo and over-expression of miR-425-5p reversed the NaAsO2-induced anti-angiogenesis through its direct target cerebral cavernous malformation 3 (CCM3). Furthermore, we showed that NaAsO2 up-regulated CCM3 expression in vitro and in vivo.

In the United States, these problems affect 60% of the population. Critical to these statistics is the association with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome among other noncommunicable diseases. Many factors, including sugars, have been charged as potential causes. However, obesity and overweight and their attendant health problems continue to increase despite the fact that there is a decline in the consumption of sugars. Sugars vary in their types and structure. From a food science perspective, sugars present an array of attributes that extend beyond taste, flavor, color, and texture to aspects such as structure and shelf-life of foods. From a public health perspective, there is considerable controversy about the effect of sugar relative to satiety, digestion, and noncommunicable diseases. This comprehensive overview from experts in food science, nutrition and health, sensory science, and biochemistry describes the technical and functional roles of sugar in food production, provides a balanced evidence-based assessment of the literature and addresses many prevalent health issues commonly ascribed to sugar by the media, consumer groups, international scientific organizations, and policy makers. The preponderance of the evidence indicates that sugar as such does not contribute to adverse health outcomes when consumed under isocaloric conditions. The evidence generally indicates, as noted by the 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, that sugar, like any other caloric macronutrient, such as protein and fat, when consumed in excess leads to conditions such as obesity and related comorbidities. More recently, the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended limiting dietary sugar to 10% of total energy in an effort to reduced the risk of these noncommunicable diseases.",eng,Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This Article argues that focusing on lifestyle can backfire, by increasing health inequities and inviting human rights violations. If States fail to take meaningful steps to alter the social and economic structures that create health risks and encourage unhealthy behavior, health at the population level is unlikely to improve significantly.

Since its establishment in 2007 the Division of Tropical and Humanitarian Medicine at the Geneva University Hospitals has developed a variety of partnerships. Frameworks to assess these partnerships are needed and recent attention in the field of public management on collaborative governance may provide a useful approach for analyzing international collaborations.--NEW SECTION--Projects of the Division of Tropical and Humanitarian Medicine were analyzed by collaborators within the Division using the model proposed by Emerson and colleagues for collaborative governance, which comprises different components that assess the collaborative process.--NEW SECTION--International projects within the Division of Tropical and Humanitarian Medicine can be divided into four categories: Human resource development; Humanitarian response; Neglected Tropical Diseases and Noncommunicable diseases. For each of these projects there was a clear leader from the Division of Tropical and Humanitarian Medicine as well as a local counterpart. These individuals were seen as leaders both due to their role in establishing the collaboration as well as their technical expertise. Across these projects the actual partners vary greatly. This diversity means a wide range of contributions to the collaboration, but also complexity in managing different interests. A common definition of the collaborative aims in each of the projects is both a formal and informal process. Legal, financial and administrative aspects of the collaboration are the formal elements. These can be a challenge based on different administrative requirements. Friendship is part of the informal aspects and helps contribute to a relationship that is not exclusively professional.--NEW SECTION--Using collaborative governance allows the complexity of managing partnerships to be presented. The framework used highlights the process of establishing collaborations, which is an element often negated by other more traditional models used in international partnerships.

27128351,10.1016/j.virol.2016.04.020,Viral genome imaging of hepatitis C virus to probe heterogeneous viral infection and responses to antiviral therapies.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus of enormous global health importance, with direct-acting antiviral therapies replacing an immunostimulatory interferon-based regimen. The dynamics of HCV positive and negative-strand viral RNAs (vRNAs) under antiviral perturbations have not been studied at the single-cell level, leaving a gap in our understanding of antiviral kinetics and host-virus interactions. Here, we demonstrate quantitative imaging of HCV genomes in multiple infection models, and multiplexing of positive and negative strand vRNAs and host antiviral RNAs. We capture the varying kinetics with which antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of action clear HCV infection, finding the NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir to induce a rapid decline in negative-strand viral RNAs. We also find that the induction of host antiviral genes upon interferon treatment is positively correlated with viral load in single cells. This study adds smFISH to the toolbox available for analyzing the treatment of RNA virus infections.",eng,Virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Knowledge gaps included a need to rethink spatial access to maternal care in low- and middle-income settings, and a need for more explicit use of GIS to account for the geographical variation in the effect of risk factors on adverse maternal outcomes. Limited evidence existed to suggest that use of GIS had influenced maternal health policy. Instead, application of GIS to maternal health was largely influenced by policy priorities in global maternal health.--NEW SECTION--Investigation of the role of GIS in contributing to future policy directions is warranted, particularly for elucidating determinants of global maternal health.",eng,International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Direct head-to-head comparisons are lacking.--NEW SECTION--Systemic review of Medline, EMBASE, PILOTS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Global Health Library was conducted without language restrictions. Randomized clinical trials ≥8 weeks in duration using structured clinical interview-based outcome measures, active-control conditions (e.g. supportive psychotherapy), and intent-to-treat analysis were selected for analyses. Independent review, data abstraction, and bias assessment were performed using standardized processes. Study outcomes were grouped around conventional follow-up time periods (3, 6, and 9 months). Combined effect sizes were computed using meta-analyses for medication versus control, medication pre-/posttreatment, psychotherapy versus control, and psychotherapy pre-/posttreatment.--NEW SECTION--Effect sizes for trauma-focused psychotherapies (TFPs) versus active control conditions were greater than medications versus placebo and other psychotherapies versus active controls. TFPs resulted in greater sustained benefit over time than medications. Sertraline, venlafaxine, and nefazodone outperformed other medications, although potential for methodological biases were high. Improvement following paroxetine and fluoxetine treatment was small. Venlafaxine and stress inoculation training (SIT) demonstrated large initial effects that decreased over time. Bupropion, citalopram, divalproex, mirtazapine, tiagabine, and topiramate failed to differentiate from placebo. Aripiprazole, divalproex, guanfacine, and olanzapine failed to differentiate from placebo when combined with an antidepressant.--NEW SECTION--Study findings support use of TFPs over nontrauma-focused psychotherapy or medication as first-line interventions. Second-line interventions include SIT, and potentially sertraline or venlafaxine, rather than entire classes of medication, such as SSRIs. Future revisions of CPGs should prioritize studies that utilize active controls over waitlist or treatment-as-usual conditions.

Given recent major advances in medical microbiology, curricular changes will likely be needed. Before transforming curricula, we must first obtain a comprehensive understanding of contemporary medical student microbiology education.--NEW SECTION--We disseminated a 38-question survey to microbiology course directors and curriculum deans at 142 US medical schools accredited by the Liason Committee on Medical Education. Survey questions focused on course leadership, curricular structure, course content, and educator perceptions about microbiology education locally and nationally.--NEW SECTION--One hundred and four (73%) of 142 schools completed the survey. Ninety-four (90%) schools identified a course director. Of these, 48% were led by microbiologists alone, 23% co-led by a microbiologist and a clinician, 20% by a clinician alone, and 8% by a laboratory medicine physician with or without a co-director. At 55 (53%) schools, the curricula were organized in a single block or course and at 47 (45%) it was integrated into other curricula. Areas of emerging importance, such as antimicrobial stewardship, global health, infection control, and the microbiome, were addressed at 66%, 65%, 64%, and 47% of institutions, respectively. Respondents reported the following concerns: challenges integrating microbiology into other courses, reduced total teaching hours, and difficulty balancing basic and clinical science topics.--NEW SECTION--Preclinical microbiology course directors report significant challenges in meeting the needs of changing curriculum structure and content.

Recent advances in prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) strategies, incorporating life-long universal maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART, ""Option B+"") with extended breastfeeding, may improve HEU child health substantially. We critically reviewed reports of mortality/morbidity among HEU and HIV-unexposed (HU) children in sub-Saharan Africa.--NEW SECTION--We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Academic Search Premier, Global Health & Psychosocial Instruments databases, conference abstracts, and reference lists for longitudinal studies from sub-Saharan Africa reporting mortality and clinical morbidity among HIV-uninfected children aged ≤10 years, by maternal HIV status. Studies were appraised by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and ACROBAT-NRSI. Due to substantial heterogeneity of study designs, populations and results (I(2) = 75%), data were not synthesised.--NEW SECTION--We included 37 reports (28 studies, 11 164 HEU children); methodological and reporting quality were variable. Most reports came from settings without universal access to maternal ART (n = 35). Results were conflicting, with some studies indicating increased risk of mortality, hospitalisation and/or under-nutrition among HEU children, while others found no evidence of increased risk. In subanalyses, improved maternal health, ART use and breastfeeding were strongly protective for all outcomes. Only 39% (11/28) of studies adjusted for major confounders. Reports from settings using universal maternal ART with breastfeeding (n = 2) found no differences in growth or development but did not report mortality or infectious morbidity.--NEW SECTION--The existing literature provides little insight into HEU child health under recently adopted PMTCT strategies. There is a need for robust comparative data on HEU and HIV-unexposed child health outcomes under Option B+; optimising breastfeeding practices and increasing maternal use of ART should be urgent public health priorities.",eng,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We compared children managed with severe sepsis in European and U.S. PICUs to identify geographic variation, which may improve the design of future international studies.--NEW SECTION--We conducted a secondary analysis of the Sepsis PRevalence, OUtcomes, and Therapies study. Data about PICU characteristics, patient demographics, therapies, and outcomes were compared. Multivariable regression models were used to determine adjusted differences in morbidity and mortality.--NEW SECTION--European and U.S. PICUs.--NEW SECTION--Children with severe sepsis managed in European and U.S. PICUs enrolled in the Sepsis PRevalence, OUtcomes, and Therapies study.--NEW SECTION--None.--NEW SECTION--European PICUs had fewer beds (median, 11 vs 24; p < 0.001). European patients were younger (median, 1 vs 6 yr; p < 0.001), had higher severity of illness (median Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, 5.0 vs 3.8; p = 0.02), and were more often admitted from the ward (37% vs 24%).

Raw morbidity and mortality outcomes were worse for European compared with U.S. patients, but after adjusting for patient characteristics, there were no significant differences in mortality, multiple organ dysfunction, disability at discharge, length of stay, or ventilator/vasoactive-free days.--NEW SECTION--Children with severe sepsis admitted to European PICUs have higher severity of illness, are more likely to be admitted from hospital wards, and receive more intensive care therapies than in the United States. The lack of significant differences in morbidity and mortality after adjusting for patient characteristics suggests that the approach to care between regions, perhaps related to PICU bed availability, needs to be considered in the design of future international clinical trials in pediatric severe sepsis.",eng,Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016
27123955,10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4,Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for late radiation tissue injury.,"Cancer is a significant global health problem. Radiotherapy is a treatment for many cancers and about 50% of people having radiotherapy will be long-term survivors. Some will experience late radiation tissue injury (LRTI) developing months or years later. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been suggested as a treatment for LRTI based upon the ability to improve the blood supply to these tissues. It is postulated that HBOT may result in both healing of tissues and the prevention of problems following surgery.--NEW SECTION--To assess the benefits and harms of HBOT for treating or preventing LRTI.--NEW SECTION--We updated the searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 11), MEDLINE, EMBASE, DORCTIHM and reference lists of articles in December 2015. We also searched for ongoing trials at clinicaltrials.gov.--NEW SECTION--Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of HBOT versus no HBOT on LRTI prevention or healing.--NEW SECTION--Three review authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant trials using the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and extracted the data from the included trials.--NEW SECTION--Fourteen trials contributed to this review (753 participants). There was some moderate quality evidence that HBOT was more likely to achieve mucosal coverage with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (risk ratio (RR) 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 1.6, P value = 0.003, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5; 246 participants, 3 studies). There was also moderate quality evidence of a significantly improved chance of wound breakdown without HBOT following operative treatment for ORN (RR 4.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 16.8, P value = 0.04, NNTB 4; 264 participants, 2 studies). From single studies there was a significantly increased chance of improvement or cure following HBOT for radiation proctitis (RR 1.72; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.9, P value = 0.04, NNTB 5), and following both surgical flaps (RR 8.7; 95% CI 2.7 to 27.5, P value = 0.0002, NNTB 4) and hemimandibulectomy (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8, P value = 0.001, NNTB 5). There was also a significantly improved probability of healing irradiated tooth sockets following dental extraction (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, P value = 0.009, NNTB 4).There was no evidence of benefit in clinical outcomes with established radiation injury to neural tissue, and no randomised data reported on the use of HBOT to treat other manifestations of LRTI. These trials did not report adverse events.--NEW SECTION--These small trials suggest that for people with LRTI affecting tissues of the head, neck, anus and rectum, HBOT is associated with improved outcome. HBOT also appears to reduce the chance of ORN following tooth extraction in an irradiated field. There was no such evidence of any important clinical effect on neurological tissues. The application of HBOT to selected participants and tissues may be justified. Further research is required to establish the optimum participant selection and timing of any therapy. An economic evaluation should be undertaken.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The objective of this contribution was to estimate the burden of CVD mortality caused by alcohol consumption.--NEW SECTION--Risk assessment modelling with alcohol-attributable CVD mortality as primary outcome. The mortality burden of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and ischaemic stroke (IS) attributable to alcohol consumption was estimated using attributable-fraction methodology. Relative Risk (RR) data for IHD and IS were obtained from the most comprehensive meta-analyses (except for Russia and surrounding countries where alcohol RR data were obtained from a large cohort study). Age-group specific RRs were calculated, based on large studies. Data on mortality were obtained from the World Health Organization's Global Health Estimates and alcohol consumption data were obtained from the Global Information System on Alcohol and Health. Risk of former drinkers was modelled taking into account global differences in the prevalence of sick quitters among former drinkers. Alcohol-attributable mortality estimates for all other CVD causes except IHD and IS were obtained from the 2014 Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health.--NEW SECTION--An estimated 780,381 CVD deaths (441,893 and 338,490 CVD deaths among men and women respectively) were attributable to alcohol consumption globally in 2012, accounting for 1.4 % of all deaths and 26.6 % of all alcohol-attributable deaths. This is in contrast to the previously estimated 1,128,273 CVD deaths attributable to alcohol consumption globally, and represents a decrease of 30.8 % in alcohol-attributable CVD mortality and of 10.6 % in the global burden of all alcohol-attributable deaths.--NEW SECTION--When the most comprehensive and recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses are taken as bases, the net impact of alcohol consumption on CVD is lower than previously estimated.",eng,BMC public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and cancers, yet, research on HM practices and preventative care of MM survivors has limited report. The study comprised a descriptive, correlational, and cross-sectional online survey design. Survey of patients with MM was carried out through the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) and the Association of Cancer Online Resources (ACOR) e-mail list services. The members of the IMF and ACOR e-mail list services were surveyed, of which 237 patients responded. The modified Medical Expenditure Preventive Survey-Preventive Care questionnaire was used; it included items that ask patients regarding their healthcare practices that relate to dental care, cancer prevention, addiction, lifestyles, sensory screening, immunizations, cardiovascular, endocrine, psychosocial, and bone health. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's chi-square, and Spearman's rho correlation coefficient were obtained. In this study, men had statistically significant inferior global health maintenance scores than women (P = 0.002). Being employed (P = 0.054) and married or partnered (P = 0.017) were significantly correlated with better health maintenance patterns among male respondents. In contrast, no statistically significant correlations between sociodemographic factors and health maintenance patterns were found in women. Patients with MM, particularly men, require continued education and close monitoring of health maintenance practices. These findings are consistent with publications looking at gender disparities in healthcare utilization in the United States. Studies show that men, in general, are less likely to seek preventative healthcare screenings.

However, there are few data on the interest in global health by students pursuing a career in anesthesiology. The objective of this survey was to evaluate the importance of global health opportunities in regard to applicants' choice of anesthesiology residency programs.--NEW SECTION--Anesthesiology residency program directors in the United States were invited to distribute an online survey to recently matched residents. To reduce study bias, the survey included a wide selection of reasons for program choices in addition to global health. Participants were asked to rate independently, on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = least important, 10 = most important), the importance that each factor had on their selection of an anesthesiology residency program.--NEW SECTION--Of the 117 U.S. anesthesiology programs contacted, 87 (74%) distributed the survey. Completed surveys were obtained from 582 of 1,092 (53%) polled participants. All factors assessed were rated between 5 and 9 and the global health median [interquartile range] rating was 6 [3-7].

More than three-quarters reported being interested in participating in, or reading about, global health activities during their residency. Responders with previous global health experience, or who were interested in an ""in-country"" experience, were more likely to choose programs that had global health opportunities available during residency.--NEW SECTION--Anesthesia residency program applicants are interested in global health.

However, whilst there have been several studies exploring the retention of health personnel towards this end, available literature does not provide a detailed narrative on strategies used in peri-urban communities. The aim of this study was to explore retention strategies implemented in a Zimbabwean peri-urban community between 2009 and 2014 and implications for peri-urban communities towards the health system reform agenda.--NEW SECTION--The study was carried out in Epworth, a peri-urban community in Harare, Zimbabwe. The research design was a cross-sectional survey, in which qualitative methods were used in sampling, data collection, reporting and analysis. Qualitative tools were used to collect data through in-depth interviews with purposively selected health personnel managers at 10 local clinics and sample interviews with purposively selected healthcare workers who included registered general nurses, state-certified nurses, midwives, environmental health technicians, nurse aids and community health volunteers at each clinic.

Causal effects working from nutrition to disability and from disability back to nutrition present an empirical challenge to measuring either of these effects. However, disability affects nutrition whatever the cause of disability, whereas nutrition is likelier to affect disease-related disability than war- or work-related disability.--NEW SECTION--This paper investigates the association of food insufficiency with the risk of physical disability. Data on disability by cause allow us to address the difficulty of reverse causality.--NEW SECTION--Multinomial logit regressions of disability by cause on food insufficiency are run using survey data from 2010 on 2575 Palestinian refugee households in Lebanon. Controls include household sociodemographic, health and economic characteristics. Regressions of food insufficiency on disability by cause are also run.--NEW SECTION--Disability has a significant coefficient in regressions of food insufficiency, whatever the cause of disability; but in regressions of disability on food insufficiency, food insufficiency is significant only for disease-related disability (log odds of disease-related disability .78 higher, p = .008). The difference in the results by cause of disability is evidence of a significant association between food insufficiency and disease-related disability, net of any reverse effect from disability to food access.--NEW SECTION--The association between disease-related disability and food insufficiency is statistically significant suggesting that even taking into account feedback from disability to nutrition, nutrition is an effective level of intervention to avert the poverty-disability trap resulting from the impoverishing effect of disability.",eng,Disability and health journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27115736,10.1371/journal.pone.0151219,Global Economic Burden of Norovirus Gastroenteritis.,"Despite accounting for approximately one fifth of all acute gastroenteritis illnesses, norovirus has received comparatively less attention than other infectious pathogens. With several candidate vaccines under development, characterizing the global economic burden of norovirus could help funders, policy makers, public health officials, and product developers determine how much attention and resources to allocate to advancing these technologies to prevent and control norovirus.--NEW SECTION--We developed a computational simulation model to estimate the economic burden of norovirus in every country/area (233 total) stratified by WHO region and globally, from the health system and societal perspectives. We considered direct costs of illness (e.g., clinic visits and hospitalization) and productivity losses.--NEW SECTION--Globally, norovirus resulted in a total of $4.2 billion (95% UI: $3.2-5.7 billion) in direct health system costs and $60.3 billion (95% UI: $44.4-83.4 billion) in societal costs per year. Disease amongst children <5 years cost society $39.8 billion, compared to $20.4 billion for all other age groups combined. Costs per norovirus illness varied by both region and age and was highest among adults ≥55 years. Productivity losses represented 84-99% of total costs varying by region. While low and middle income countries and high income countries had similar disease incidence (10,148 vs. 9,935 illness per 100,000 persons), high income countries generated 62% of global health system costs. In sensitivity analysis, the probability of hospitalization had the largest impact on health system cost estimates ($2.8 billion globally, assuming no hospitalization costs), while the probability of missing productive days had the largest impact on societal cost estimates ($35.9 billion globally, with a 25% probability of missing productive days).--NEW SECTION--The total economic burden is greatest in young children but the highest cost per illness is among older age groups in some regions. These large costs overwhelmingly are from productivity losses resulting from acute illness. Low, middle, and high income countries all have a considerable economic burden, suggesting that norovirus gastroenteritis is a truly global economic problem. Our findings can help identify which age group(s) and/or geographic regions may benefit the most from interventions.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27115709,10.1371/journal.pmed.1001999,The Vast and Varied Global Burden of Norovirus: Prospects for Prevention and Control.,"Globally, norovirus is associated with approximately one-fifth of all diarrhea cases, with similar prevalence in both children and adults, and is estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths annually in developing countries. Norovirus is an important pathogen in a number of high-priority domains: it is the most common cause of diarrheal episodes globally, the principal cause of foodborne disease outbreaks in the United States, a key health care-acquired infection, a common cause of travel-associated diarrhea, and a bane for deployed military troops. Partly as a result of this ubiquity and burden across a range of different populations, identifying target groups and strategies for intervention has been challenging. And, on top of the breadth of this public health problem, there remain important gaps in scientific knowledge regarding norovirus, especially with respect to disease in low-income settings. Many pathogens can cause acute gastroenteritis. Historically, rotavirus was the most common cause of severe disease in young children globally. Now, vaccines are available for rotavirus and are universally recommended by the World Health Organization. In countries with effective rotavirus vaccination programs, disease due to that pathogen has decreased markedly, but norovirus persists and is now the most common cause of pediatric gastroenteritis requiring medical attention. However, the data supporting the precise role of norovirus in low- and middle-income settings are sparse. With vaccines in the pipeline, addressing these and other important knowledge gaps is increasingly pressing. We assembled an expert group to assess the evidence for the global burden of norovirus and to consider the prospects for norovirus vaccine development. The group assessed the evidence in the areas of burden of disease, epidemiology, diagnostics, disease attribution, acquired immunity, and innate susceptibility, and the group considered how to bring norovirus vaccines from their current state of development to a viable product that will benefit global health.",eng,PLoS medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

There is considerable diversity in both H1 and H3 influenza viruses circulating in swine due to the frequent introductions of viruses from humans and birds coupled with geographic segregation of global swine populations. Much of this diversity is characterized genetically but the antigenic diversity of these viruses is poorly understood. Critically, the antigenic diversity shapes the risk profile of swine influenza viruses in terms of their epizootic and pandemic potential. Here, using the most comprehensive set of swine influenza virus antigenic data compiled to date, we quantify the antigenic diversity of swine influenza viruses on a multi-continental scale. The substantial antigenic diversity of recently circulating viruses in different parts of the world adds complexity to the risk profiles for the movement of swine and the potential for swine-derived infections in humans.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27112506,10.1177/0886260516646101,Intimate Partner Violence Among Older Portuguese Immigrant Women in Canada.,"One third of the immigrant population around the world is made up of women. Of these women, many belong to the Portuguese community. Immigrants account for more than one in five Canadians. The Portuguese older immigrant women living in Canada are vulnerable to be victims of intimate partner violence (IPV), which is a prevalent and important global health issue that affects differently diverse groups. There are few available researches regarding IPV on this population. The objective of this study is to understand how Portuguese older immigrant women living in Canada experience IPV. This is a qualitative study with a social phenomenological focus. Alfred Schutz's motivation theory was used to analyze the impulses that led older women to face IPV. The data were collected from July to October 2013 in the Greater Toronto Area. Ten women 60 years or older were included in the study. The participants perceived themselves as being victimized by their current or ex partners. They are unhappy and suffer from a variety of health problems, which they related to their experience of IPV. These factors, along with participants' personal beliefs, and their legal situations as immigrants in Canada, made them act, either in a way that would try to maintain their relationships, or tried to escape the violent situation. IPV is a complex phenomenon, with different perceptions surrounding it. The experiences of the older immigrant women showed that ending the marriage is not always a possibility to them because of cultural issues and their immigrant status in Canada. Some women wish help and support to improve their relationships.",eng,Journal of interpersonal violence,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2019

Type D personality was measured with the 14-item Type D Personality Scale (DS14). Mental health status was measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The QoL outcomes were assessed longitudinally using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 and Quality of Life Questionnaire-STO22 at baseline and six months after diagnosis.--NEW SECTION--The proportion of patients with symptom duration of more than one month and who were diagnosed after emergency admissions in the Type D group was significantly higher than that in the non-Type D personality group. At both of the time points, Type D patients reported statistically significant lower scores on role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning (all Ps < 0.001) functional scales, global health status/QoL scales (P < 0.001), and worse symptom scores compared to patients without a Type D personality. During the six-month time frame, a higher percentage of patients in the Type D group demonstrated a considerable QoL deterioration. Clinically elevated levels of anxiety and depression were more prevalent in Type D than in non-Type D survivors (both Ps < 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in three-year overall survival between the patients in the Type D group and the non-Type D personality group.--NEW SECTION--Type D personality is associated with poor QoL, three-year overall survival and mental health status among survivors of gastric cancer, even after adjustment of confounding background variables.

Efforts to expand these programs have been increasing across medical disciplines. Whether orthopedic residents will participate remains unknown. This study quantified and characterized orthopedic resident interest and barriers to IHEs in US residency programs. A web-based survey was administered to residents from 154 US orthopedic residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education 2014 to 2015. Questions assessed demographics and program background, previous medical experience abroad, barriers to participation, and level of interest in participating in an international health elective during their training and beyond. Twenty-seven (17.5%) residency programs responded. Chi-square analysis showed that residents who expressed interest in participating were significantly more likely to have experience abroad compared with those who expressed no interest (P<.004). Analysis using Mann-Whitney U test suggested that those who expressed interest were more likely to believe IHEs are important to resident training (P<.0011; mean Likert scale score of 3.7 vs 2.6), provide valuable experience (P<.001; mean Likert scale score of 4.2 vs 3.2), and should be required for orthopedic residencies (P<.001; mean Likert scale score of 2.8 vs 1.9). Residents are strongly interested in participating in IHEs during their training, and many may integrate global health into future practices. Residents perceive lack of funding and scheduling flexibility as barriers preventing them from participating. Prior experience abroad influences level of interest, and international clinical experience may enhance future perception of its value.

Early in the research, the drawings contributed to a major reorientation in the direction of the research project. The insights generated through analysis of the life history drawings exemplify how this participatory research technique can direct attention to social processes that feel salient to community members.

This study draws on baseline data from an on-going cluster randomized study of an intervention to improve EID services at six government hospitals across Kenya. Two logistic regressions examined potential predictors of ""on time"" (infant ≤6 weeks of age) vs. ""late"" (≥7 weeks) and ""on time"" versus ""very late"" (≥12 weeks) EID engagement among 756 mother-infant pairs. A quarter of the infants failed to get ""on time"" testing. Predictors of ""on time"" testing included being informed about EID by providers when pregnant, perceiving less HIV stigma, and mother's level of education. Predictors of ""very late"" testing (≥12 weeks of age) included not being informed about EID by providers when pregnant and living farther from services. Findings highlight the importance of ensuring that health care providers actively and repeatedly inform HIV+ mothers of the availability of EID services, reduce stigma by frequently communicating judgment free support, and assisting mothers in early planning for accessing EID services. Extra care should be focused on engaging mothers with less formal education who are at increased risk for seeking ""late"" EID testing. This study offers clear targets for improving services so that all HIV-exposed infants can be properly engaged in EID services, thus increasing the potential for the best possible outcomes for this vulnerable population.",eng,AIDS and behavior,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Among different Vibrio cholerae strains, only O1 and O139 cause acute diarrheal diseases that are related to epidemic and pandemic outbreaks. The currently available cholera vaccines are mainly lived and attenuated vaccines consisting of V. cholerae virulence factors such as toxin-coregulated pili (TCP), outer membrane proteins (Omps), and nontoxic cholera toxin B subunit (CTB). Nowadays, there is a great interest in designing an efficient epitope vaccine against cholera. Epitope vaccines consisting of immunodominant epitopes and adjuvant molecules enhance the possibility of inciting potent protective immunity. In this study, V. cholerae protective antigens (OmpW, OmpU, TcpA and TcpF) and the CTB, which is broadly used as an immunostimulatory adjuvant, were analyzed using different bioinformatics and immunoinformatics tools. The common regions between promiscuous epitopes, binding to various HLA-II supertype alleles, and B-cell epitopes were defined based upon the aforementioned protective antigens. The ultimately selected epitopes and CTB adjuvant were fused together using proper GPGPG linkers to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. A three-dimensional model of the thus constructed vaccine was generated using I-TASSER. The model was structurally validated using the ProSA-web error-detection software and the Ramachandran plot. The validation results indicated that the initial 3D model needed refinement. Subsequently, a high-quality model obtained after various refinement cycles was used for defining conformational B-cell epitopes. Several linear and conformational B-cell epitopes were determined within the epitope vaccine, suggesting likely antibody triggering features of our designed vaccine. Next, molecular docking was performed between the 3D vaccine model and the tertiary structure of the toll like receptor 2 (TLR2). To gain further insight into the interaction between vaccine and TLR2, molecular dynamics simulation was performed, corroborating stable vaccine-TLR2 binding. In sum, the results suggest that our designed epitope vaccine could incite robust long-term protective immunity against V. cholera.",eng,Computational biology and chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27106911,10.1093/heapol/czw023,"""Lives in the balance"": The politics of integration in the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health.","A decade ago, the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH) was established to combat the growing fragmentation of global health action into uncoordinated, issue-specific efforts. Inspired by dominant global public-private partnerships for health, the PMNCH brought together previously competing advocacy coalitions for safe motherhood and child survival and attracted support from major donors, foundations and professional bodies. Today, its founders highlight its achievements in generating priority for 'MNCH', encouraging integrated health systems thinking and demonstrating the value of collaboration in global health endeavours. Against this dominant discourse on the success of the PMNCH, this article shows that rhetoric in support of partnership and integration often masks continued structural drivers and political dynamics that bias the global health field towards vertical goals. Drawing on ethnographic research, this article examines the Safe Motherhood Initiative's evolution into the PMNCH as a response to the competitive forces shaping the current global health field. Despite many successes, the PMNCH has struggled to resolve historically entrenched programmatic and ideological divisions between the maternal and child health advocacy coalitions. For the Safe Motherhood Initiative, the cost of operating within an extremely competitive policy arena has involved a partial renouncement of ambitions to broader social transformations in favour of narrower, but feasible and 'sellable' interventions. A widespread perception that maternal health remains subordinated to child health even within the Partnership has elicited self-protective responses from the safe motherhood contingent. Ironically, however, such responses may accentuate the kind of fragmentation to global health governance, financing and policy solutions that the Partnership was intended to challenge. The article contributes to the emerging critical ethnographic literature on global health initiatives by highlighting how integration may only be possible with a more radical conceptualization of global health governance.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27104885,10.1002/jor.23268,"Cell-based therapies for intervertebral disc and cartilage regeneration- Current concepts, parallels, and perspectives.","Lower back pain from degenerative disc disease represents a global health burden, and presents a prominent opportunity for regenerative therapeutics. While current regenerative therapies such as autologous disc chondrocyte transplantation (ADCT), allogeneic juvenile chondrocyte implantation (NuQu®), and immunoselected allogeneic adipose derived precursor cells (Mesoblast) show exciting clinical potential, limitations remain. The heterogeneity of preclinical approaches and the paucity of clinical guidance have limited translational outcomes in disc repair, lagging almost a decade behind cartilage repair. Advances in cartilage repair have evolved to single step approaches with improved orthopedic repair and regeneration. Elements from cartilage regeneration endeavors could be adopted and applied to harness translatable approaches and deliver a clinically and economically feasible regenerative surgery for back pain. In this article, we trace the developments behind the translational success of cartilage repair, examine elements to consider in achieving disc regeneration, and the need for surgical redesign. We further discuss clinical parameters, objectives, and coordination required to deliver improved regenerative surgery. Cell source, processing, and delivery modalities are key issues to be addressed in considering surgical redesign. Advances in biomanufacturing, tissue cryobanking, and point of care cell processing technology may enable intraoperative solutions for single step procedures. To maximize translational success a triad partnership between clinicians, industry, and researchers will be critical in providing instructive clinical guidelines for design as well as practical and economic considerations. This will allow a consensus in research ventures and add regenerative surgery into the algorithm in managing and treating a debilitating condition such as back pain. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Although much attention has been paid to disease control measures, there is relatively little consideration of the importance of training the next generation of health-related researchers to play their important role in this global epidemic. The lack of support for early stage investigators in low- and middle-income countries interested in the global NCD field has resulted in inadequate funding opportunities for research, insufficient training in advanced research methodology and data analysis, lack of mentorship in manuscript and grant writing, and meager institutional support for developing, submitting, and administering research applications and awards. To address this unmet need, The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-UnitedHealth Collaborating Centers of Excellence initiative created a Training Subcommittee that coordinated and developed an intensive, mentored health-related research experience for a number of early stage investigators from the 11 Centers of Excellence around the world. We describe the challenges faced by early stage investigators in low- and middle-income countries, the organization and scope of the Training Subcommittee, training activities, early outcomes of the early stage investigators (foreign and domestic) and training materials that have been developed by this program that are available to the public.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop an action plan to restrain the problem of antibiotic resistance. One approach in UTI control could be the use of lactobacilli because these indigenous inhabitants in human intestine have been found to play an important role in protecting the host from various infections.--NEW SECTION--We sought to check the efficacy of locally isolated Lactobacillus species to eradicate antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria causing UTI.--NEW SECTION--Lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled fruits and vegetables and grown in MRS medium were screened against multi-drug-resistant Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus fecalis.--NEW SECTION--Fifty-four lactic acid bacteria were isolated from spoiled fruits and vegetables, of which 11 Gram-positive and catalase-negative Lactobacillus isolates were identified by carbohydrate assimilation profiles as Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. paracasei, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. helveticus, L. brevis, L. salivarius, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, L. animalis, and L. plantarum. The latter organism had the highest abundance of all the samples, so its isolates were also verified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolated Lactobacilli were screened against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens, viz. C. albicans, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. fecalis, and E. coli. The growth inhibition zone (GIZ) was over 10 mm against all the uropathogenic test organisms, where L. fermentum and L. plantarum strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activities against E. coli and E. faecalis, with a GIZ up to 28 mm. The susceptibility test to 16 antibiotics showed multidrug resistance (3 to 5 antibiotics) among all the tested uropathogens.--NEW SECTION--The obtained results revealed that all the Lactobacillus isolates displayed antimicrobial activity against 6 out of 7 antibiotic-resistant uropathogens, indicating that these bacteria could represent a good ecological plan for the control and prevention of UTI.",eng,Jundishapur journal of microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A series of indicators of tobacco control sustainability were identified in grantee/country advisor reports to The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease under the Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Control (2007-2015). Focus groups and key informant interviews in seven low and middle-income countries (52 government and civil society participants) provided consensus ratings of the indicators' relative importance. Data were reviewed and the indicators were accorded relative weightings to produce the 'Index of Tobacco Control Sustainability' (ITCS).--NEW SECTION--All 31 indicators were considered 'Critical' or 'Important' by the great majority of participants. There was consensus that a tool to measure progress towards tobacco control sustainability was important. The most critical indicators related to financial policies and allocations, a national law, a dedicated national tobacco control unit and civil society tobacco control network, a national policy against tobacco industry 'Corporate Social Responsibility' (CSR), national mortality and morbidity data, and national policy evaluation mechanisms.--NEW SECTION--The 31 indicators were agreed to be 'critical' or 'important' factors for tobacco control sustainability.

Building capacity in terms of well-equipped local researchers and service providers is a key to bridging the inequity in global health. Launched by Penn State University in 2014, the Pan University Network for Global Health responds to this need by bridging researchers at more than 10 universities across the globe. In this paper we outline our framework for international and interdisciplinary collaboration, as well the rationale for our research areas, including a review of these two themes. After its initial meeting, the network has established two central thematic priorities: 1) urbanization and health and 2) the intersection of infectious diseases and NCDs. The urban population in the global south will nearly double in 25 years (approx. 2 billion today to over 3.5 billion by 2040). Urban population growth will have a direct impact on global health, and this growth will be burdened with uneven development and the persistence of urban spatial inequality, including health disparities. The NCD burden, which includes conditions such as hypertension, stroke, and diabetes, is outstripping infectious disease in countries in the global south that are considered to be disproportionately burdened by infectious diseases. Addressing these two priorities demands an interdisciplinary and multi-institutional model to stimulate innovation and synergy that will influence the overall framing of research questions as well as the integration and coordination of research.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This meta-analysis aims to provide an overview of reported evidence on the efficacy of music interventions in the treatment of hypertension.--NEW SECTION--A systematic literature search was conducted for publications on the effect of music interventions on blood pressure in adult hypertensive subjects published between January 1990-June 2014. Randomized controlled trials with a follow-up duration ≥28 days were included. Blood pressure measures were pooled using inverse variance weighting.--NEW SECTION--Of the 1689 abstracts reviewed, 10 randomized controlled trials were included. Random-effects pooling of the music intervention groups showed a trend toward a decrease in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 144 mmHg(95 % CI:137-152) to 134 mmHg(95 % CI:124-144), and in mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from 84 mmHg(95 % CI:78-89) to 78 mmHg(95 % CI:73-84). Fixed-effect analysis of a subgroup of 3 trials with valid control groups showed a significant decrease in pooled mean SBP and DBP in both intervention and control groups. A comparison between music intervention groups and control groups was not possible due to unavailable measures of dispersion.--NEW SECTION--This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed a trend towards a decrease in blood pressure in hypertensive patients who received music interventions, but failed to establish a cause-effect relationship between music interventions and blood pressure reduction. Considering the potential value of this safe, low-cost intervention, well-designed, high quality and sufficiently powered randomized studies assessing the efficacy of music interventions in the treatment of hypertension are warranted.",eng,BMC cardiovascular disorders,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Although it can have significant morbidity, perioperative mortality is low. Little is known about whether major complications after CRS/HIPEC have a lasting impact on patients' quality of life (QOL).--NEW SECTION--We retrospectively reviewed data from a prospectively collected database on patients treated with CRS/HIPEC for PSM (2011-2014). Patients with CRS/HIPEC and 6-month QOL evaluation were included. Major perioperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade 3/4) were the primary independent variable. QOL was evaluated using the validated EORTC QLQ-C30 score. The primary outcome was 6-month global health score. Secondary outcomes were individual functional and symptom domains.--NEW SECTION--Forty-two patients were analyzed. Median age was 57.5; 64 % were female. Origin of PSM was appendix (55 %), colorectal (38 %), mesothelioma (5 %), and small bowel (2 %). Fourteen patients (33 %) had major (grade 3/4) complications.

The impact of antimicrobial resistance is greatest on low-income countries, which face the double burden of fewer antibiotic choices and higher rates of infectious diseases. Currently, Guyana has no national policy on rational prescribing. This study aims to characterize antibiotic prescribing patterns in children discharged from the emergency department at Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation (GPHC), as per the World Health Organization (WHO) prescribing indicators.--NEW SECTION--A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients (aged 1 month-13 years) seen in the GPHC emergency department between January and December 2012 was conducted. Outpatient prescriptions for eligible patients were reviewed. Patient demographics, diagnosis, and drugs prescribed were recorded. The following WHO Prescribing Indicators were calculated: i) average number of drugs prescribed per patient encounter, ii) percentage of encounters with an antibiotic prescribed, iii) percentage of antibiotics prescribed by generic name, and iv) percentage of antibiotics prescribed from essential drugs list or formulary.--NEW SECTION--Eight hundred eleven patient encounters were included in the study. The mean patient age was 5.55 years (s = 3.98 years). 59.6 % (n = 483) patients were male. An average of 2.5 drugs were prescribed per encounter (WHO standard is 2.0). One or more antibiotic was prescribed during 36.9 % (n = 299) of all encounters (WHO standard is 30 %). 90.83 % of antibiotics were prescribed from the essential drugs formulary list and 30 % of the prescriptions included the drug's generic name. The average duration of antibiotic therapy was 5.73 days (s = 3.53 days). Of the 360 antibiotics prescribed, 74.7 % (n = 269) were broad-spectrum. B-lactam penicillins were prescribed most frequently (51.4 %), with amoxicillin being the most popular choice (33.9 %).

The situation is exacerbated by azole resistance developed by fungal pathogens. Candida tropicalis is an opportunistic pathogen that causes candidiasis, for example, in immune-compromised individuals, cancer patients, and those who undergo organ transplantation. It is a member of the non-albicans group of Candida that are known to be azole-resistant, and is frequently seen in individuals being treated for cancers, HIV-infection, and those who underwent bone marrow transplantation. Although the genome of C. tropicalis was sequenced in 2009, the genome annotation has not been supported by experimental validation. In the present study, we have carried out proteomics profiling of C. tropicalis using high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry. We identified 2743 proteins, thus mapping nearly 44% of the computationally predicted protein-coding genes with peptide level evidence. In addition to identifying 2591 proteins in the cell lysate of this yeast, we also analyzed the proteome of the conditioned media of C. tropicalis culture and identified several unique secreted proteins among a total of 780 proteins. By subjecting the mass spectrometry data derived from cell lysate and conditioned media to proteogenomic analysis, we identified 86 novel genes, 12 novel exons, and corrected 49 computationally-predicted gene models. To our knowledge, this is the first high-throughput proteomics study of C. tropicalis validating predicted protein coding genes and refining the current genome annotation.

27093107,10.1089/omi.2016.0040,Hypothesis: Do miRNAs Targeting the Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 Gene (LRRK2) Influence Parkinson's Disease Susceptibility?,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a frequently occurring neurodegenerative motor disorder adversely impacting global health. There is a paucity of biomarkers and diagnostics that can forecast susceptibility to PD. A new research frontier for PD pathophysiology is the study of variations in microRNA (miRNA) expression whereby miRNAs serve as ""upstream regulators"" of gene expression in relation to functioning of the dopamine neuronal pathways. Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a frequently studied gene in PD. Little is known about the ways in which expression of miRNAs targeting LRKK2 impact PD susceptibility. In a sample of 204 unrelated subjects (102 persons with PD and 102 healthy controls), we report here candidate miRNA expression in whole blood samples as measured by real-time PCR (hsa-miR-4671-3p, hsa-miR-335-3p, hsa-miR-561-3p, hsa-miR-579-3p, and hsa-miR-3143) that target LRRK2. Using step-wise logistic regression, and controlling for covariates such as age, gender, PD disease severity, concomitant medications, and co-morbidity, we found that the combination of has-miR-335-3p, has-miR-561-3p, and has-miR-579-3p account for 50% of the variation in regards to PD susceptibility (p<0.0001). Notably, the hsa-miR-561-3p expression was the most robust predictor of PD in both univariate and multivariate analyses (p<0.001). Moreover, the biological direction (polarity) of the association was plausible in that the candidate miRNAs displayed a diminished expression in patients. This is consistent with the hypothesis that decreased levels of miRNAs targeting LRRK2 might result in a gain of function for LRRK2, and by extension, loss of neuronal viability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical association study of the above candidate miRNAs' expression in PD using peripheral samples. These observations may guide future clinical diagnostics research on PD.",eng,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Sacubitril is an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) which degrades vasoactive peptides such as atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide. Valsartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker which is usually used in hypertension. Although HF has been a global health burden, for decades there has been lack of novel therapeutic options as many trials failed due to potential side effects. With the published results of the landmark trial Prospective comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine the Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in HF (PARADIGM-HF), a new direction in the treatment of HF is anticipated. This trial showed that LCZ696 was able to reduce the primary composite end point of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, and similar reduction was observed for cardiovascular death. This review article also highlights the results of 4 published trials of LCZ696 in both HTN and HF. After the results of PARADIGM-HF trial, the major challenge will be outcome in regular clinical practice, as subjects in the trial were mostly stable New York Heart Association class II patients with no comorbidities. In addition, many trials are simultaneously in progress regarding the use of LCZ696 in patients with diabetes, renal failure, and hepatic impairment. To conclude, sacubitril/valsartan significantly improved morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic HF, but it will need meticulous attention when used in real outpatient practice.",eng,Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Serodiagnosis of HTL is a great challenge due to many biological factors, including hampered specificity and/or sensitivity. This investigation addresses the unmet need for new diagnostic markers of HTL, and describes a simple platform to improve the serodiagnosis. A constrained conformational phage display random peptide library combined with a magnetic microsphere-based subtraction strategy was used to identify ligands with potential diagnostic applications. Six clones were selected against IgG antibodies from HTL patients, characterized by sequencing and confirmed by a phage-ELISA using sera from patients developing visceral leishmaniasis (n=20), Chagas disease (n=10), mucosal (n=30) and cutaneous (n=20) leishmaniasis; as well as from healthy subjects living in endemic (n=20) and non-endemic (n=30) areas of leishmaniasis. A wild-type M13-phage clone and a soluble Leishmania antigenic extract were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Three clones reached 100% sensitivity and specificity, without any cross-reactivity with sera from patients with leishmaniasis-related diseases. Briefly, we describe for the first time a set of serological markers based on three immunodominant mimotopes that showed 100% accuracy, and that could be used in a phage-ELISA assay for the HTL serodiagnosis.",eng,Journal of immunological methods,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In 2007, an outbreak in the Federated States of Micronesia sparked public health concern. In 2013, the virus began to spread across other parts of Oceania and in 2015, a large outbreak in Latin America began in Brazil. Possible associations with microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome observed in this outbreak have raised concerns about continued global spread of Zika virus, prompting its declaration as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. We conducted species distribution modelling to map environmental suitability for Zika. We show a large portion of tropical and sub-tropical regions globally have suitable environmental conditions with over 2.17 billion people inhabiting these areas.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This paper assesses VHI expenditure trends in LMIC and explores possible explanations. This illuminates challenges deriving from changes in VHI expenditure as countries aim to progress equitably towards universal health coverage (UHC).--NEW SECTION--Health expenditure data was retrieved from the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database to calculate VHI, OOP and general government health (GGHE) expenditure as a share of total health expenditure (THE) for the period of 1995-2012. A literature analysis offered potential reasons for trends in countries and regions.--NEW SECTION--In 2012, VHI as a percentage of THE (abbreviated as VHI%) was below 1 % in 49 out of 138 LMIC. Twenty-seven countries had no or more than five years of data missing. VHI% ranged from 1 to 5 % in 39 LMIC and was above 5 % in 23 LMIC. There is an upwards average trend in VHI% across all regions. However, increases in VHI% cannot be consistently linked with OOP falling or being redirected into private prepayment. There are various countries which exhibit rising VHI alongside a rise in OOP and fall in GGHE, which is a less desirable path in order to equitably progress towards UHC.--NEW SECTION--Reasons for the VHI expenditure trends across LMIC include: external influences; government policies on the role of VHI and its regulation; and willingness and ability of the population to enrol in VHI schemes. Many countries have paid insufficient attention to the potentially risky role of VHI for equitable progress towards UHC. Expanding VHI markets bear the risk of increasing fragmentation and inequities. To avoid this, health financing strategies need to be clear regarding the role given to VHI on the path towards UHC.",eng,International journal for equity in health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The effects of anti-TB drugs on male reproductive system have not been properly evaluated. We investigated the effects of anti-TB drugs on testicular antioxidant indices, sperm characteristics and hormonal levels in rats, and the protective role of kolaviron (KV), a biflavonoid from Garcinia kola seed.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-eight male Wistar rats were assigned into four groups and orally treated with corn oil (control), anti-TB drugs [4-Tabs=isoniazid (5 mg/kg), rifampicin (10 mg/kg), pyrazinamide (15 mg/kg) and ethambutol (15 mg/kg) in combination], anti-TB drugs +KV and KV alone (200 mg/kg). Anti-TB drugs and KV were given three times per week for 8 weeks. In vitro, reducing power, inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO), diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radical scavenging effects of KV were examined.--NEW SECTION--KV at 10, 20, 50 and 100 μg/mL showed strong reducing potential and effectively scavenged DPPH and OH radicals in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, KV significantly inhibited LPO in rats' liver homogenate. In vivo, administration of 4-Tabs caused a significant (p<0.05) decrease in body weight gain and weight of testis of rats. Body weight gain and weight of testis decreased by 45% and 36%, respectively, in the 4-Tabs-treated rats. Also, 4-Tabs increased testicular lipid peroxidation by 82%, with a concomitant decrease in antioxidant indices. Testicular reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase decreased by 2.2-, 1.9- and 1.6-folds, respectively. Likewise, 4-Tabs markedly decreased sperm count, motility, luteinizing hormone and testosterone. Co-administration of KV with 4-Tabs normalized body weight, enhanced antioxidant system and improved sperm characteristics.--NEW SECTION--Kolaviron protects male reproductive system from oxidative damage by anti-tuberculosis drugs via the antioxidative mechanism.",eng,Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27088519,10.1016/j.yebeh.2016.03.019,A pediatric epilepsy diagnostic tool for use in resource-limited settings: A pilot study.,"It is estimated that nearly 80% of the 50 million people affected with epilepsy globally live in regions where specialist care and diagnostic tests are scarce and care is often delivered through a primary health provider with limited training. To improve diagnostic accuracy of the history and physical examination, we developed and piloted a questionnaire to discriminate between focal versus generalized epilepsy, with the future goal to guide medication choices.--NEW SECTION--Through literature review and retrospective chart review of 75 children with epilepsy at Boston Children's Hospital, a 15-item questionnaire was developed. Simple motor seizures were excluded for the purposes of this questionnaire. The questionnaire was then translated in local dialects and prospectively validated at Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, and University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Children 6months-18years of age with suspected or active epilepsy were identified, and a nonphysician administered the questionnaire to the patient's caregiver. Next, each patient was evaluated by a pediatric neurologist blinded to the questionnaire results, and together with locally obtained but remotely interpreted EEG, an electroclinical diagnosis was made. The questionnaire data were compared with this clinical gold standard.--NEW SECTION--A total of 59 children participated: 28 from Tanzania and 31 from Zambia. Sixteen patients were excluded: 5 were excluded because of incomplete data, and 11 did not meet criteria for epilepsy based on initial screening questions. Of the remaining 43 patients, 28 had focal or multifocal epilepsy (65%), and 15 (35%) had generalized epilepsy. The questionnaire had a sensitivity of 78% and positive predictive value of 81.5%. Data were analyzed using a Rasch model, testing the questionnaire's internal consistency, reliability, and its discriminative validity in classifying focal versus generalized epilepsy against an electroclinical diagnosis. The mean epilepsy score for focal epilepsy was 0.084 logits compared with -1.147 logits for generalized epilepsy, demonstrating a large effect size [F (1, 41)=13.490, p<0.001].--NEW SECTION--Our questionnaire provides a straightforward method to improve diagnostic accuracy, and could assist in bridging the diagnostic gap in pediatric epilepsy in resource-limited settings. This tool was specifically designed to be easily implemented by any healthcare provider. This pilot study prompts broader prospective validation in additional settings for further refinement, and for performance assessment of impact on provider's practice, ability to guide medication choices, and ultimately improve treatment outcomes in resource-limited regions.",eng,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

OECD reported that more than half (52%) of the adult population in the European Union is overweight or obese. Obesity and obesity-related co-morbidities have deep negative effects on morbidity, mortality, professional and personal quality of life. Healthcare costs represent a negative impact of this disease, with an associated economic cost of 100 billion US$ per year in the United States. The most prescribed drugs for obesity treatment worldwide are orlistat, and phentermine/topiramate extended release, while the major prescribed drug for the same disease in the US are exenatide and dapagliflozin.

Efficient production, successful deployment, and ongoing retention based on carefully constructed policies regarding the career opportunities of nurses, midwives, and other providers in health care systems are key to ensuring universal health coverage. Yet nurses are constrained by practice regulations, workplaces, and career ladder barriers from contributing to primary health care delivery. Evidence shows that quality HIV care, comparable to that of physicians, is provided by trained nurses and associate clinicians, but many African countries' health systems remain dependent on limited numbers of physicians and fail to meet the demand for treatment.

However, the speed and magnitude of these changes vary substantially across countries, even at similar levels of development. In this study, we use past trends and relationships to estimate future health spending, disaggregated by the source of those funds, to identify the financing trajectories that are likely to occur if current policies and trajectories evolve as expected.--NEW SECTION--We extracted data from WHO's Health Spending Observatory and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Financing Global Health 2015 report. We converted these data to a common purchasing power-adjusted and inflation-adjusted currency. We used a series of ensemble models and observed empirical norms to estimate future government out-of-pocket private prepaid health spending and development assistance for health. We aggregated each country's estimates to generate total health spending from 2013 to 2040 for 184 countries. We compared these estimates with each other and internationally recognised benchmarks.--NEW SECTION--Global spending on health is expected to increase from US$7·83 trillion in 2013 to $18·28 (uncertainty interval 14·42-22·24) trillion in 2040 (in 2010 purchasing power parity-adjusted dollars). We expect per-capita health spending to increase annually by 2·7% (1·9-3·4) in high-income countries, 3·4% (2·4-4·2) in upper-middle-income countries, 3·0% (2·3-3·6) in lower-middle-income countries, and 2·4% (1·6-3·1) in low-income countries. Given the gaps in current health spending, these rates provide no evidence of increasing parity in health spending. In 1995 and 2015, low-income countries spent $0·03 for every dollar spent in high-income countries, even after adjusting for purchasing power, and the same is projected for 2040. Most importantly, health spending in many low-income countries is expected to remain low. Estimates suggest that, by 2040, only one (3%) of 34 low-income countries and 36 (37%) of 98 middle-income countries will reach the Chatham House goal of 5% of gross domestic product consisting of government health spending.--NEW SECTION--Despite remarkable health gains, past health financing trends and relationships suggest that many low-income and lower-middle-income countries will not meet internationally set health spending targets and that spending gaps between low-income and high-income countries are unlikely to narrow unless substantive policy interventions occur. Although gains in health system efficiency can be used to make progress, current trends suggest that meaningful increases in health system resources will require concerted action.--NEW SECTION--Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27086170,10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30168-4,"Development assistance for health: past trends, associations, and the future of international financial flows for health.","Disbursements of development assistance for health (DAH) have risen substantially during the past several decades. More recently, the international community's attention has turned to other international challenges, introducing uncertainty about the future of disbursements for DAH.--NEW SECTION--We collected audited budget statements, annual reports, and project-level records from the main international agencies that disbursed DAH from 1990 to the end of 2015. We standardised and combined records to provide a comprehensive set of annual disbursements. We tracked each dollar of DAH back to the source and forward to the recipient. We removed transfers between agencies to avoid double-counting and adjusted for inflation. We classified assistance into nine primary health focus areas: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, maternal health, newborn and child health, other infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, Ebola, and sector-wide approaches and health system strengthening. For our statistical analysis, we grouped these health focus areas into two categories: MDG-related focus areas (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, child and newborn health, and maternal health) and non-MDG-related focus areas (other infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, sector-wide approaches, and other). We used linear regression to test for structural shifts in disbursement patterns at the onset of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs; ie, from 2000) and the global financial crisis (impact estimated to occur in 2010). We built on past trends and associations with an ensemble model to estimate DAH through the end of 2040.--NEW SECTION--In 2015, US$36·4 billion of DAH was disbursed, marking the fifth consecutive year of little change in the amount of resources provided by global health development partners. Between 2000 and 2009, DAH increased at 11·3% per year, whereas between 2010 and 2015, annual growth was just 1·2%. In 2015, 29·7% of DAH was for HIV/AIDS, 17·9% was for child and newborn health, and 9·8% was for maternal health. Linear regression identifies three distinct periods of growth in DAH. Between 2000 and 2009, MDG-related DAH increased by $290·4 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 174·3 million to 406·5 million) per year. These increases were significantly greater than were increases in non-MDG DAH during the same period (p=0·009), and were also significantly greater than increases in the previous period (p<0·0001). Between 2000 and 2009, growth in DAH was highest for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Since 2010, DAH for maternal health and newborn and child health has continued to climb, although DAH for HIV/AIDS and most other health focus areas has remained flat or decreased. Our estimates of future DAH based on past trends and associations present a wide range of potential futures, although our mean estimate of $64·1 billion (95% UI $30·4 billion to $161·8 billion) shows an increase between now and 2040, although with a large uncertainty interval.--NEW SECTION--Our results provide evidence of two substantial shifts in DAH growth during the past 26 years. DAH disbursements increased faster in the first decade of the 2000s than in the 1990s, but DAH associated with the MDGs increased the most out of all focus areas. Since 2010, limited growth has characterised DAH and we expect this pattern to persist. Despite the fact that DAH is still growing, albeit minimally, DAH is shifting among the major health focus areas, with relatively little growth for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. These changes in the growth and focus of DAH will have critical effects on health services in some low-income countries. Coordination and collaboration between donors and domestic governments is more important than ever because they have a great opportunity and responsibility to ensure robust health systems and service provision for those most in need.--NEW SECTION--Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27086142,10.1007/s40121-016-0107-0,Meningococcal Vaccinations.,"Neisseria meningitidis, a gram-negative diplococcal bacterium, is a common asymptomatic nasopharyngeal colonizer that may infrequently lead to invasive disease in the form of meningitis or bacteremia. Six serogroups (A, B, C, W, X and Y) are responsible for the majority of invasive infections. Increased risk of disease occurs in specific population groups including infants, adolescents, those with asplenia or complement deficiencies, and those residing in crowded living conditions such as in college dormitories. The incidence of invasive meningococcal disease varies geographically with some countries (e.g., in the African meningitis belt) having both high endemic disease rates and ongoing epidemics, with annual rates reaching 1000 cases per 100,000 persons. Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with meningococcal disease, it remains a major global health threat best prevented by vaccination. Several countries have implemented vaccination programs with the selection of specific vaccine(s) based on locally prevalent serogroup(s) of N. meningitidis and targeting population groups at highest risk. Polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines became available over 40 years ago, but are limited by their inability to produce immunologic memory responses, poor immunogenicity in infants/children, hyporesponsiveness after repeated doses, and lack of efficacy against nasopharyngeal carriage. In 1999, the first meningococcal conjugate vaccines were introduced and have been successful in overcoming many of the shortcomings of polysaccharide vaccines. The implementation of meningococcal conjugate vaccination programs in many areas of the world (including the massive campaign in sub-Saharan Africa using a serogroup A conjugate vaccine) has led to dramatic reductions in the incidence of meningococcal disease by both individual and population protection. Progressive advances in vaccinology have led to the recent licensure of two effective vaccines against serogroup B [MenB-4C (Bexsero) and MenB-FHbp (Trumenba)]. Overall, the evolution of novel meningococcal vaccines and the effective implementation of targeted vaccination programs has led to a substantial decrease in the burden of disease worldwide representing a major public health accomplishment.",eng,Infectious diseases and therapy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27084099,10.4049/jimmunol.1600155,Discriminating Protective from Nonprotective Plasmodium-Specific CD8+ T Cell Responses.,"Despite decades of research, malaria remains a global health crisis. Current subunit vaccine approaches do not provide efficient long-term, sterilizing immunity against Plasmodium infections in humans. Conversely, whole parasite vaccinations with their larger array of target Ags have conferred long-lasting sterilizing protection to humans. Similar studies in rodent models of malaria reveal that CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in liver-stage immunity after whole parasite vaccination. However, it is unknown whether all CD8(+) T cell specificities elicited by whole parasite vaccination contribute to protection, an issue of great relevance for enhanced subunit vaccination. In this article, we show that robust CD8(+) T cell responses of similar phenotype are mounted after prime-boost immunization against Plasmodium berghei glideosome-associated protein 5041-48-, sporozoite-specific protein 20318-325-, thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) 130-138-, or circumsporozoite protein (CSP) 252-260-derived epitopes in mice, but only CSP252-260- and TRAP130-138-specific CD8(+) T cells provide sterilizing immunity and reduce liver parasite burden after sporozoite challenge. Further, CD8(+) T cells specific to sporozoite surface-expressed CSP and TRAP proteins, but not intracellular glideosome-associated protein 50 and sporozoite-specific protein 20, efficiently recognize sporozoite-infected hepatocytes in vitro. These results suggest that: 1) protection-relevant antigenic targets, regardless of their immunogenic potential, must be efficiently presented by infected hepatocytes for CD8(+) T cells to eliminate liver-stage Plasmodium infection; and 2) proteins expressed on the surface of sporozoites may be good target Ags for protective CD8(+) T cells.",eng,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27084016,10.1128/AEM.00337-16,Use of Colistin and Other Critical Antimicrobials on Pig and Chicken Farms in Southern Vietnam and Its Association with Resistance in Commensal Escherichia coli Bacteria.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health problem, and emerging semi-intensive farming systems in Southeast Asia are major contributors to the AMR burden. We accessed 12 pig and chicken farms at key stages of production in Tien Giang Province, Vietnam, to measure antimicrobial usage and to investigate the prevalence of AMR to five critical antimicrobials (β-lactams, third-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and polymyxins) and their corresponding molecular mechanisms among 180 Escherichia coli isolates. Overall, 94.7 mg (interquartile range [IQR], 65.3 to 151.1) and 563.6 mg (IQR, 398.9 to 943.6) of antimicrobials was used to produce 1 kg (live weight) of chicken and pig, respectively. A median of 3 (out of 8) critical antimicrobials were used on pig farms. E. coli isolates exhibited a high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin (97.8% and 94.4% for chickens and pigs, respectively), ciprofloxacin (73.3% and 21.1%), gentamicin (42.2% and 35.6%), and colistin (22.2% and 24.4%). The prevalence of a recently discovered colistin resistance gene, mcr-1, was 19 to 22% and had strong agreement with phenotypic colistin resistance. We conducted plasmid conjugation experiments with 37 mcr-1 gene-positive E. coli isolates and successfully observed transfer of the gene in 54.0% of isolates through a plasmid of approximately 63 kb, consistent with one recently identified in China. We found no significant correlation between total use of antimicrobials at the farm level and AMR. These data provide additional insight into the role of mcr-1 in colistin resistance on farms and outline the dynamics of phenotypic and genotypic AMR in semi-intensive farming systems in Vietnam.--NEW SECTION--Our study provides accurate baseline information on levels of antimicrobial use, as well as on the dynamics of phenotypic and genotypic resistance for antimicrobials of critical importance among E. coli over the different stages of production in emerging pig and poultry production systems in Vietnam. E. coli isolates showed a high prevalence of resistance (>20%) to critically important antimicrobials, such as colistin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin. The underlying genetic mechanisms identified for colistin (the mcr-1 gene) and quinolone (gyrA gene mutations) are likely to play a major role in AMR to those compounds. Conjugation experiments led to the identification of a 63-kb plasmid, similar to one recently identified in China, as the potential carrier of the mcr-1 gene. These results should encourage greater restrictions of such antimicrobials in Southeast Asian farming systems.",eng,Applied and environmental microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The devastating effects of the current epidemic of Ebola in West Africa have put the global health response in acute focus. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa as a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"". A small proportion of scientific literature is dedicated to Ebola research.--NEW SECTION--To identify global research trends in Ebola research, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science™ database was used to search for data, which encompassed original articles published from 1900 to 2013. The keyword ""Ebola"" was used to identify articles for the purposes of this review. In order to include all published items, the database was searched using the Basic Search method.--NEW SECTION--The earliest record of literature about Ebola indexed in the Web of Science is from 1977. A total of 2477 publications on Ebola, published between 1977 and 2014 (with the number of publications increasing annually), were retrieved from the database. Original research articles (n = 1623, 65.5%) were the most common type of publication. Almost all (96.5%) of the literature in this field was in English. The USA had the highest scientific output and greatest number of funding agencies. Journal of Virology published 239 papers on Ebola, followed by Journal of Infectious Diseases and Virology, which published 113 and 99 papers, respectively. A total of 1911 papers on Ebola were cited 61,477 times.--NEW SECTION--This analysis identified the current state of research and trends in studies about Ebola between 1977 and 2014.

It renders the central nervous system susceptible to infectious and noninfectious diseases. HIV-positive individuals may present to neurosurgical services with brain lesions of unknown etiology. The differential diagnosis in these cases is broad, including opportunistic infections and malignancies, and investigation should be tailored accordingly. Opportunistic infections of the central nervous system can be complicated by hydrocephalus, and the management is pathogen dependent. Patients may also present to a neurosurgical service with conditions unrelated to their HIV status. This review outlines important conditions that cause brain lesions and hydrocephalus. It addresses the issues of diagnosis and intervention in HIV-positive patients in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy, while not ignoring the potential for opportunistic central nervous system infection in undiagnosed patients. The care of HIV-positive patients presenting to neurosurgical services requires a multidisciplinary approach, which is reflected in the authorship of this review, as well as in the guidance given.",eng,Journal of neurosurgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Protocol for a systematic review of qualitative evidence using thematic synthesis.,"Claims of and calls for evidence-informed policymaking pervade public health journals and the literature of governments and global health agencies, yet our knowledge of the arrangements most conducive to the appropriate use of evidence is incomplete and fragmented. Designing interventions to encourage evidence use by policymakers requires an understanding of the processes through which officials access, assess and use research, including technical and political factors related to evidence uptake, and the ways in which the policymaking context can affect these processes. This review aims to systematically locate, synthesise and interpret the existing qualitative work on the process of evidence use in public health policymaking, with the aim of producing an empirically derived taxonomy of factors affecting evidence use.--NEW SECTION--This review will include primary qualitative studies that examined the use of research evidence by policymakers to inform decisions about public health. To locate studies, we will search nine bibliographic databases, hand-search nine public health and policy journals and scan the websites of relevant organisations and the reference lists of previous reviews of evidence use in policymaking. Two reviewers will independently screen studies, apply inclusion criteria and appraise the quality of included studies. Data will be coded inductively and analysed using thematic synthesis. An augmented version of the CASP Qualitative Checklist will be used to appraise included studies, and the CERQual tool will be used to assess confidence in the review's findings. The review's results will be presented narratively and in tabular form. Synthesis findings will be summarised as a taxonomy of factors affecting evidence use in public health policymaking. A conceptual framework explaining the relationships between key factors will be proposed. Implications and recommendations for policy, practice and future research will be discussed.--NEW SECTION--This review will be the most comprehensive to date to synthesise the qualitative literature on evidence use by public health policymakers and will be the first to apply a formal method of qualitative metasynthesis to this body of evidence. Its results will be useful both to scholars of evidence use and knowledge translation and to decision-makers and academics attempting to influence public health policy.",eng,Systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Economic tools have been used previously; however, how prioritization results might differ when done using broader considerations identified by local stakeholders has yet to be assessed. A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was used to assess multi-stakeholder expressed concerns around disease prioritization via focus groups held in Quebec and Burkina Faso. Stakeholders weighted criteria and comparisons were made across study sites. A pilot disease prioritization was done to examine effects on disease rankings. A majority of identified criteria were common to both sites. The effect of context specific criteria and weights resulted in similar yet distinct prioritizations of diseases. The presence of consistent criteria between sites suggests that common concerns exist for prioritization; however, context-specific adjustments reveal much regarding resource availability, capacity and concerns that should be considered as this impacts disease ranking. Participatory decision aid approaches facilitate rich knowledge exchange and problem structuring. Furthermore, given multiple actors in low- and middle-income countries settings, multi-actor collaborations across non-governmental organizations, local government and community are important. Formal mechanisms such as MCDA provide means to foster consensus, shared awareness and collaboration.",eng,International journal of environmental research and public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

27075622,10.1002/14651858.CD006419.pub4,Antihelminthics in helminth-endemic areas: effects on HIV disease progression.,"Helminth infections, such as soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, and lymphatic filariasis, are prevalent in many countries where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also common. There is some evidence from observational studies that HIV and helminth co-infection may be associated with higher viral load and lower CD4+ cell counts. Treatment of helminth infections with antihelminthics (deworming drugs) may have benefits for people living with HIV beyond simply clearance of worm infections.This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2009 and we have expanded it to include outcomes of anaemia and adverse events.--NEW SECTION--To evaluate the effects of deworming drugs (antihelminthic therapy) on markers of HIV disease progression, anaemia, and adverse events in children and adults.--NEW SECTION--In this review update, we searched online for published and unpublished studies in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICRTP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Global Health Library up to 29 September 2015. We also searched databases listing conference abstracts, scanned reference lists of articles, and contacted the authors of included studies.--NEW SECTION--We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared antihelminthic drugs with placebo or no intervention in HIV-positive people.--NEW SECTION--Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias. The primary outcomes were changes in HIV viral load and CD4+ cell count, and secondary outcomes were anaemia, iron deficiency, adverse events, and mortality events. We compared the effects of deworming using mean differences, risk ratios (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.--NEW SECTION--Eight trials met the inclusion criteria of this review, enrolling a total of 1612 participants. Three trials evaluated the effect of providing antihelminthics to all adults with HIV without knowledge of their helminth infection status, and five trials evaluated the effects of providing deworming drugs to HIV-positive individuals with confirmed helminth infections. Seven trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and one in Thailand. Antihelminthics for people with unknown helminth infection statusProviding antihelminthics (albendazole and praziquantel together or separately) to HIV-positive adults with unknown helminth infection status may have a small suppressive effect on mean viral load at six weeks but the 95% CI includes the possibility of no effect (difference in mean change -0.14 log10 viral RNA/mL, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.07, P = 0.19; one trial, 166 participants, low quality evidence).Repeated dosing with deworming drugs over two years (albendazole every three months plus annual praziquantel), probably has little or no effect on mean viral load (difference in mean change 0.01 log10 viral RNA, 95% CI: -0.03 to -0.05; one trial, 917 participants, moderate quality evidence), and little or no effect on mean CD4+ count (difference in mean change 2.60 CD4+ cells/µL, 95% CI -10.15 to 15.35; P = 0.7; one trial, 917 participants, low quality evidence). Antihelminthics for people with confirmed helminth infectionsTreating confirmed helminth infections in HIV-positive adults may have a small suppressive effect on mean viral load at six to 12 weeks following deworming (difference in mean change -0.13 log10 viral RNA, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.00; P = 0.04; four trials, 445 participants, low quality evidence). However, this finding is strongly influenced by a single study of praziquantel treatment for schistosomiasis. There may also be a small favourable effect on mean CD4+ cell count at 12 weeks after deworming in HIV-positive populations with confirmed helminth infections (difference in mean change 37.86 CD4+ cells/µL, 95% CI 7.36 to 68.35; P = 0.01; three trials, 358 participants, low quality evidence). Adverse events and mortality There is no indication that antihelminthic drugs impart additional risks in HIV-positive populations. However, adverse events were not well reported (very low quality evidence) and trials were underpowered to evaluate effects on mortality (low quality evidence).--NEW SECTION--There is low quality evidence that treating confirmed helminth infections in HIV-positive adults may have small, short-term favourable effects on markers of HIV disease progression. Further studies are required to confirm this finding. Current evidence suggests that deworming with antihelminthics is not harmful, and this is reassuring for the routine treatment of confirmed or suspected helminth infections in people living with HIV in co-endemic areas.Further long-term studies are required to make confident conclusions regarding the impact of presumptively deworming all HIV-positive individuals irrespective of helminth infection status, as the only long-term trial to date did not demonstrate an effect.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Reports show that African men suffer disproportionately from PCa compared to men from other parts of the world. It is still quite difficult to accurately describe the burden of PCa in Africa due to poor cancer registration systems. We systematically reviewed the literature on prostate cancer in Africa and provided a continent-wide incidence rate of PCa based on available data in the region.--NEW SECTION--A systematic literature search of Medline, EMBASE and Global Health from January 1980 to June 2015 was conducted, with additional search of Google Scholar, International Association of Cancer Registries (IACR), International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and WHO African region websites, for studies that estimated incidence rate of PCa in any African location. Having assessed quality and consistency across selected studies, we extracted incidence rates of PCa and conducted a random effects meta-analysis.--NEW SECTION--Our search returned 9766 records, with 40 studies spreading across 16 African countries meeting our selection criteria. We estimated a pooled PCa incidence rate of 22.0 (95% CI: 19.93-23.97) per 100,000 population, and also reported a median incidence rate of 19.5 per 100,000 population. We observed an increasing trend in PCa incidence with advancing age, and over the main years covered.--NEW SECTION--Effective cancer registration and extensive research are vital to appropriately quantifying PCa burden in Africa. We hope our findings may further assist at identifying relevant gaps, and contribute to improving knowledge, research, and interventions targeted at prostate cancer in Africa.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27073889,10.1371/journal.pone.0153567,Low-Density Granulocytes Are Elevated in Mycobacterial Infection and Associated with the Severity of Tuberculosis.,"Tuberculosis remains a global health problem caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Numerous studies have established a close correlation between the development of tuberculosis and the roles of neutrophils. Recently, a distinct population of CD15+ granulocytes was found to be present in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction in humans. This population of granulocytes, termed low-density granulocytes (LDGs), was reported to be elevated and associated with disease activity or severity in a number of different conditions including SLE, asthma and HIV infection. However, both the frequency and clinical significance of LDGs associated with tuberculosis are unclear. Here we determined LDG levels and made comparisons between subjects with active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and healthy controls, between PTB patients with mild-to-moderate disease and patients with advanced disease, and among PTB patients following anti-tuberculous therapy of varying durations. The direct correlation between M. tuberculosis infection and LDG levels was confirmed by in vitro infection of whole peripheral blood and isolated granulocytes with mycobacteria. Our results demonstrated that PBMCs in PTB patients contained significantly elevated percentages of LDGs compared with control subjects. LDGs in tuberculosis expressed higher levels of activation markers compared to normal-density granulocytes (NDGs). M. tuberculosis induced the generation of LDGs in both whole blood and isolated NDGs from control subjects, which suggests that LDGs associated with M. tuberculosis infection are likely to originate from in situ activation. Furthermore, our results revealed that the frequency of LDGs is associated with the severity of tuberculosis.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The survival status, complications and objective curative effects were compared between the groups. The average operative time in the IP group was significantly longer than that in the NIP group (243±51 vs. 214±77 min). The tumor response rates were 9.5% and 0 at the 2nd month after surgery in the IP and NIP groups, respectively (P<0.05). The IP group exhibited a trend toward pain relief at the 6th month after surgery. The global health status scores of the IP group were higher than those of the NIP group at the 3rd and 6th month after surgery.

Flavonoids are plant polyphenolic compounds, studied extensively for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties. Quercetin-3-O-glucoside (Q3G) is a flavonoid which is widely found in plants. Six novel long chain fatty acid [stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] derivatives of Q3G were evaluated for their potential in protecting human lung fibroblasts against cytotoxicity induced by selected cigarette smoke toxicants: 4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone (NNK), benzo-α-pyrene (BaP), nicotine and chromium (Cr[VI]). Nicotine and Cr[VI] induced toxicity in fibroblasts and reduced the percentage of viable cells, while BaP and NNK did not affect cell viability. The fatty acid derivatives of Q3G provided protection against nicotine- and Cr[VI]-induced cell death and membrane lipid peroxidation. Based on the evaluation of inflammatory markers of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the fatty acid derivatives of Q3G were found to be effective in lowering the inflammatory response.

27067141,10.1093/heapol/czw012,The emergence and effectiveness of global health networks: findings and future research.,"Global health issues vary in the amount of attention and resources they receive. One reason is that the networks of individuals and organizations that address these issues differ in their effectiveness. This article presents key findings from a research project on the emergence and effectiveness of global health networks addressing tobacco use, alcohol harm, maternal mortality, neonatal mortality, tuberculosis and pneumonia. Although networks are only one of many factors influencing priority, they do matter, particularly for shaping the way the problem and solutions are understood, and convincing governments, international organizations and other global actors to address the issue. Their national-level effects vary by issue and are more difficult to ascertain. Networks are most likely to produce effects when (1) their members construct a compelling framing of the issue, one that includes a shared understanding of the problem, a consensus on solutions and convincing reasons to act and (2) they build a political coalition that includes individuals and organizations beyond their traditional base in the health sector, a task that demands engagement in the politics of the issue, not just its technical aspects. Maintaining a focused frame and sustaining a broad coalition are often in tension: effective networks find ways to balance the two challenges. The emergence and effectiveness of a network are shaped both by its members' decisions and by contextual factors, including historical influences (e.g. prior failed attempts to address the problem), features of the policy environment (e.g. global development goals) and characteristics of the issue the network addresses (e.g. its mortality burden). Their proliferation raises the issue of their legitimacy. Reasons to consider them legitimate include their members' expertise and the attention they bring to neglected issues. Reasons to question their legitimacy include their largely elite composition and the fragmentation they bring to global health governance.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Benefit and financing incidence analyses are two analytical methods for comprehensively evaluating how well health systems perform on these objectives. This systematic review assesses progress towards equity in health care financing in LMICs through the use of BIA and FIA.--NEW SECTION--Key electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Scopus, Global Health, CinAHL, EconLit and Business Source Premier were searched. We also searched the grey literature, specifically websites of leading organizations supporting health care in LMICs. Only studies using benefit incidence analysis (BIA) and/or financing incidence analysis (FIA) as explicit methodology were included. A total of 512 records were obtained from the various sources. The full texts of 87 references were assessed against the selection criteria and 24 were judged appropriate for inclusion. Twelve of the 24 studies originated from sub-Saharan Africa, nine from the Asia-Pacific region, two from Latin America and one from the Middle East. The evidence points to a pro-rich distribution of total health care benefits and progressive financing in both sub-Saharan Africa and Asia-Pacific. In the majority of cases, the distribution of benefits at the primary health care level favoured the poor while hospital level services benefit the better-off. A few Asian countries, namely Thailand, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, maintained a pro-poor distribution of health care benefits and progressive financing.--NEW SECTION--Studies evaluated in this systematic review indicate that health care financing in LMICs benefits the rich more than the poor but the burden of financing also falls more on the rich. There is some evidence that primary health care is pro-poor suggesting a greater investment in such services and removal of barriers to care can enhance equity. The results overall suggest that there are impediments to making health care more accessible to the poor and this must be addressed if universal health coverage is to be a reality.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In this study, we investigated the anti-obesity effect and mechanism of an edible plant, Bidens pilosa, and its active constituent. We first assessed the long-term effect of B. pilosa on body composition, body weight, blood parameters in ICR mice. We observed that it significantly decreased fat content and increased protein content in ICR mice. Next, we verified the anti-obesity effect of B. pilosa in ob/ob mice. It effectively and dose-dependently reduced fat content, adipocyte size and/or body weight in mice. Moreover, mechanistic studies showed that B. pilosa inhibited the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) and Egr2 in adipose tissue. Finally, we examined the effect of 2-β-D-glucopyranosyloxy-1-hydroxytrideca-5,7,9,11-tetrayne (GHT) on adipogenesis in adipocytes. We found that B. pilosa significantly decreased the adipogenesis and lipid accumulation. This decrease was associated with the down-regulation of expression of Egr2, C/EBPs, PPARγ, adipocyte Protein 2 (aP2) and adiponectin. In summary, this work demonstrated that B. pilosa and GHT suppressed adipogenesis and lipid content in adipocytes and/or animals via the down-regulation of the Egr2, C/EBPs and PPARγ pathways, suggesting a novel application of B. pilosa and GHT against obesity.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27063079,10.1016/j.mehy.2016.02.022,Plasmodium falciparum malaria: Convergent evolutionary trajectories towards delayed clearance following artemisinin treatment.,"Malaria is a major global health challenge with 300million new cases every year. The most effective regimen for treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria is based on artemisinin and its derivatives. The drugs are highly effective, resulting in rapid clearance of parasites even in severe P. falciparum malaria patients. During the last five years, artemisinin-resistant parasites have begun to emerge first in Cambodia and now in Thailand and Myanmar. At present, the level of artemisinin resistance is relatively low with clinical presentation of delayed artemisinin clearance (a longer time to reduce parasite load) and a small decrease in artemisinin sensitivity in cultured isolates. Nevertheless, multiple genetic loci associated with delayed parasite clearance have been reported, but they cannot account for a large portion of cases. Even the most well-studied kelch 13 propeller mutations cannot always predict the outcome of artemisinin treatment in vitro and in vivo. Here we propose that delayed clearance by artemisinin could be the result of convergent evolution, driven by multiple trajectories to overcome artemisinin-induced stress, but precluded to become full blown resistance by high fitness cost. Genetic association studies by several genome-wide approaches reveal linkage disequilibrium between multiple loci and delayed parasite clearance. Genetic manipulations at some of these loci already have resulted in loss in artemisinin sensitivity. The notion presented here is by itself consistent with existing evidence on artemisinin resistance and has the potential to be explored using available genomic data. Most important of all, molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance based on multi-genic markers could be more informative than relying on any one particular molecular marker.",eng,Medical hypotheses,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

As with other forms of disaster, mass gathering-related disasters are the product of the management of different hazards, levels of exposure, and vulnerability of the population and environment, and require comprehensive risk management that looks beyond single hazards and response. Incorporating an all-hazard, prevention-driven, evidence-based approach that is multisectoral and multidisciplinary is strongly advocated by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.

The purpose of that study was to evaluate the implementation of the 'Model of Integrated and Humanized Health Services', and the Clinical Guide for Humanized Attention during Labour and Childbirth. Results of that study indicated 92.7% of women had medically augmented labours (artificial rupture of the membranes, oxytocin and epidural analgesia). One third of the women reported discontent with the care they received. This study replicated the pilot study (2010) and was conducted in seven regional hospitals across Chile. The objectives were to : (i) describe selected obstetric and neonatal outcomes of women who received care according to this new guide, (ii) identify the level of maternal-neonatal well-being after experiencing this modality of attention, and (iii) explore professionals' perceptions (obstetricians and midwives), as well as consumers' perceptions of this humanised assistance during labour and childbirth.--NEW SECTION--this is a cross sectional and descriptive, mixed methods study, conducted in two phases. The first phase was quantitative, measuring midwifery processes of care and maternal perceptions of well-being in labour and childbirth. The second phase was qualitative, exploring the perceptions of women, midwives and obstetricians regarding the discrepancy between the national guidelines and actual practice.--NEW SECTION--maternity units from seven regional hospitals from the northern, central and southern regions and two metropolitan hospitals across Chile.--NEW SECTION--1882 parturient women in the quantitative phase (including the two Metropolitan hospitals published previously). Twenty-six focus groups discussions (FGD) participated from the regional and metropolitan hospitals for the qualitative phase. MEASUREMENTS/FINDINGS: all women started labour spontaneously; 74% of women had spontaneous vaginal childbirth. Caesarean section was the outcome for 20%, and 6% had childbirth assisted with forceps. A high number of medical interventions continued to be performed in all regions, deviating widely from adherence to the national clinical guidelines. Most of the women did not receive any oral hydration, almost all received intravenous hydration; most were under continuous foetal monitoring and medically augmented labour. The majority of women received artificial rupture of membranes, epidural anaesthesia and episiotomy. Most delivered in the lithotomy position. Two thirds of women surveyed perceived adequate well-being in labour and childbirth. Findings from focus group discussions of women (FGD=9; n=27 women), midwives (FGD=9; n=40) and doctors (FGD=8; n=29) indicated lack of infrastructure for family participation in birth, inadequate training and orientation to the national guidelines for practice, and lack of childbirth preparation among women. Some women reported mistreatment by personnel. Some midwives reported lack of autonomy to manage birth physiologically.--NEW SECTION--birth is managed by midwives across the public sector in Chile. Despite evidence-based guidelines published in 2007 by the Ministry of Health, birth is not managed according to the guidelines in most cases. Women feel that care is adequate, although some women report mistreatment.--NEW SECTION--efforts to provide midwife-led care and include women in participatory models of antenatal care are recommended to promote women-centred care in accordance with the Chilean national guidelines.",eng,Midwifery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Methods MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Global Health electronic databases were searched. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were published between 2005 and 2015, evaluated an mHealth intervention, and reported an outcome relating to HIV testing. We also reviewed the bibliographies of retrieved studies for other relevant citations. The methodological rigor of selected articles was assessed, and narrative analyses were used to synthesize findings from mixed methodologies. Results A total of seven articles met the inclusion criteria. Most mHealth interventions employed a text-messaging feature and were conducted in middle- and high-income countries. The methodological rigor was moderate among studies. The current literature suggests that mHealth interventions can have significant positive effects on HIV testing initiation among vulnerable and key populations, as well as the general public. In some cases, null results were observed. Qualitative themes relating to the use of mobile technologies to increase HIV testing included the benefits of having low-cost, confidential, and motivational communication. Reported barriers included cellular network restrictions, poor linkages with physical testing services, and limited knowledge of appropriate text-messaging dose. Discussion MHealth interventions may prove beneficial in reducing the proportion of undiagnosed persons living with HIV, particularly among vulnerable and key populations. However, more rigorous and tailored interventions are needed to assess the effectiveness of widespread use.",eng,Journal of telemedicine and telecare,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Despite the size of this demographic segment of the population, there is a paucity of data on their health priorities. Engaging people in understanding their own health status has proven to be an effective mechanism for health promotion. The objective of this study was to use Photovoice, a community-based, participatory action research methodology, to understand the current health priorities of youth living in rural Uganda. Thirty-two students between the ages of 13 and 17 were recruited from four schools within the region of Soroti, Uganda. Participants were given a disposable camera and were asked to photograph situations that contributed or detracted from their health status. The cameras were then returned to the investigators and each photo taken by the participant was reviewed with the investigators during a semi-structured interview. Codes were applied to the photographs and organized into overarching themes. Each participant chose one to two photos that were most representative of their health priorities for a secondary analysis. Participants provided 499 photos that met the eligibility criteria. The most common themes presented in the photographs were 'hygiene' ( n = 73, 12.4%), 'nutrition' ( n = 69, 11.7%), and 'cleanliness' ( n = 48, 8%). 'Hygiene' ( n = 6, 14.6%) and 'exercise' ( n = 6, 14.6%) were the most common priorities articulated in the representative photographs. Photovoice proved to be an effective method to assess and express the health concerns of youth in rural Uganda. Study participants were able to articulate their health concerns and priorities through photographs and reflect on opportunities for health promotion through subsequent interviews.",eng,Global health promotion,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

With the creation of a devolved government with authority over health and social services, the country has witnessed practice and policy developments that offer distinctive opportunities for innovative research. With multidisciplinary groups of internationally recognized researchers, Scotland is able to take advantage of a unique set of opportunities for aging research: a well-profiled population brings opportunities in population data and linkage to understand people's interactions with health, social care, and other public services; while research on technology and telecare is a distinctive area where Scotland is recognized internationally for using technology to develop effective, high-quality and well-accepted services at relatively low financial cost. The paper also considers free personal care for older people and the national dementia strategy in Scotland. The potential to evaluate the impact of free personal care will provide valuable information for other global health and social care systems. Exploring the impact of the national dementia strategy is another unique area of research that can advance understanding in relation to quality of life and the development of services. The paper concludes that, while Scotland benefits from unique opportunities for progressive public policy and innovative aging research that will provide valuable lessons at the forefront of a globally aging population, the challenges associated with an aging population and increasing cultural diversity must be acknowledged and addressed to ensure that the vision of equality and social justice for all is realized.",eng,The Gerontologist,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Recognition of mental disorders, as the first step to seeking help from professional sources, has been well studied in developed countries, yet little is known about the situation in rural areas of developing countries like China. The purpose of the study is to understand the recognition of depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse and its predictive factors in a Chinese rural sample--NEW SECTION--Face-to-face interviews were conducted on a representative rural adult sample in a cross-sectional study in China (N = 2052). Respondents were presented with three vignettes depicting depression, anxiety and alcohol abuse and asked to label the disorder and its cause to assess their recognition of the three mental disorders. They also completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) to assess their current mental health status.--NEW SECTION--The alcohol abuse vignette was more frequently attributed as a mental problem than the depression vignette and anxiety vignette. The correct labeling rate was 16.1 % in the depression vignette, 15.5 % in the anxiety vignette, and 58.2 % in the alcohol vignette. Higher education is the common and also strongest factor positively predicting the recognition of all three vignettes. Beyond that, being female is an independent predictor of correct recognition of alcohol abuse, while recognition of depression and anxiety were positively predicted by younger age.--NEW SECTION--Lower recognition of depression and anxiety as compared to alcohol abuse confirms the importance and need to increase the public's awareness and knowledge about common mental disorders.

Twenty-five of them underwent cryotherapy-based rehabilitation (cryogenic chamber, local cryotherapy; individual, instrumental, and nonweight-bearing exercises) for 3 weeks. The others received 3 weeks of conventional rehabilitation (magnetic field therapy; electrotherapy; individual and instrumental exercises). The patients were examined at three time points: before rehabilitation, immediately after its completion and at a three-month follow-up visit. The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) was used to assess disease severity, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) was used to assess musculoskeletal function and a visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess pain. A global health index was also employed to assess patients' overall well-being.--NEW SECTION--Cryotherapy-based rehabilitation improved the following parameters: BASDAI (P<0.001, P<0.001), BASFI (P<0.001, P=0.007), VAS (P<0.007, P=0.001) and global health index (P<0.001, P<0.001) at the second and third assessment, respectively. Conventional rehabilitation improved the BASDAI (P<0.001), VAS (P=0.029), and overall well-being (P<0.030) at the second assessment.

None of the demographic parameters, including occupation, education status, income, and availability of caregiver, were associated with nonadherence. QoL scores, especially the symptom scores associated with side effects of imatinib, significantly differed between adherent and nonadherent patients. Multivariate analysis revealed global health status as the sole predictor of adherent behavior (odds ratio, 0.978; 95% confidence interval, 0.963-0.994; P = .007). A higher proportion of adherent patients achieved deeper molecular responses. Low QoL was associated with nonadherence to imatinib in patients with CML.--NEW SECTION--It is likely that increased long-term symptom burden due to side effects of imatinib could contribute to nonadherence.

The current unprecedented Zika viral epidemics and rapid spread in the Western hemisphere pose a substantial global threat, with associated anxiety and consequences. The lack of safe and effective drugs and vaccines against Zika or dengue epidemics further buttresses the realization from the West Africa Ebola outbreak that most emerging disease-prone countries are still poorly prepared for an emergency response. This paper examines knowledge gaps in both emerging and neglected arthropod-borne flavivirus infectious diseases associated with poverty and their implications for fostering local, national and regional emerging disease preparedness, effective and robust surveillance-response systems, sustained control and eventual elimination.

27051981,NA,The global imperative to address vaccine-preventable diseases.,"When one speaks of global health, there are few issues that actually have a health impact globally rather than in just one or more regions of the world or in a specific population. When truly thinking globally, among the most important global health issues affecting large segments of the world's populations is the persistence of vaccine-preventable diseases.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this article is to provide a perspective on the importance of immunisation as a unique global health concern in that it is not a time-limited issue.--NEW SECTION--Although there may be outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases within or across nations, effective immunisation strategies cannot be conducted in a one-off manner. No matter how effective a single immunisation campaign may be, each year there is a new global cohort of children who need protection to prevent disease, as well as new opportunities to vaccinate adults against a wide array of avoidable illnesses.

27051603,10.5588/pha.15.0072,Critical considerations for adopting the HIV 'treat all' approach in Zimbabwe: is the nation poised?,"While the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased survival and reduced the number of acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) related deaths among people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus (PLHIV), HIV/AIDS remains a global health problem and sub-Saharan Africa continues to bear the greatest burden of disease. There are also major challenges in the HIV response: as of December 2013, only 36% of PLHIV globally were on ART, and for every individual started on ART there were two new PLHIV diagnosed. This has led to considerable debate around adopting an HIV 'treat all' approach aimed at greatly escalating the number of PLHIV initiated and retained on ART, regardless of CD4 cell count or World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage, with the intended goal of achieving viral suppression which should in turn reduce HIV transmission, morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. This paper examines the issues being discussed in Zimbabwe, a low-income country with a high burden of HIV/AIDS, about the implications and opportunities of adopting an HIV 'treat all' approach, along with pertinent operational research questions that need to be answered to move the agenda forward. These discussions are timely, given the recent WHO recommendations advising ART for all PLHIV, regardless of CD4 cell count.",eng,Public health action,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27048638,10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011027,Establishing the Aus-ROC Australian and New Zealand out-of-hospital cardiac arrest Epistry.,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a global health problem with low survival. Regional variation in survival has heightened interest in combining cardiac arrest registries to understand and improve OHCA outcomes. While individual OHCA registries exist in Australian and New Zealand ambulance services, until recently these registries have not been combined. The aim of this protocol paper is to describe the rationale and methods of the Australian Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (Aus-ROC) OHCA epidemiological registry (Epistry).--NEW SECTION--The Aus-ROC Epistry is designed as a population-based cohort study. Data collection started in 2014. Six ambulance services in Australia (Ambulance Victoria, SA Ambulance Service, St John Ambulance Western Australia and Queensland Ambulance Service) and New Zealand (St John New Zealand and Wellington Free Ambulance) currently contribute data. All OHCA attended by ambulance, regardless of aetiology or patient age, are included in the Epistry. The catchment population is approximately 19.3 million persons, representing 63% of the Australian population and 100% of the New Zealand population. Data are collected using Utstein-style definitions. Information incorporated into the Epistry includes demographics, arrest features, ambulance response times, treatment and patient outcomes. The primary outcome is 'survival to hospital discharge', with 'return of spontaneous circulation' as a key secondary outcome.--NEW SECTION--Ethics approval was independently sought by each of the contributing registries. Overarching ethics for the Epistry was provided by Monash University HREC (Approval No. CF12/3938-2012001888). A population-based OHCA registry capturing the majority of Australia and New Zealand will allow risk-adjusted outcomes to be determined, to enable benchmarking across ambulance providers, facilitate the identification of system-wide strategies associated with survival from OHCA, and allow monitoring of temporal trends in process and outcomes to improve patient care. Findings will be shared with participating ambulance services and the academic community.",eng,BMJ open,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Although the development of direct-acting antivirals offers cure for a large majority of patients, there are still a number of clinical challenges. These include DAA failure in a significant subset of patients, difficult-to-treat genotypes and limited access to therapy due to high costs. Moreover, recent data indicate that the risk for liver cancer persists in patients with advanced fibrosis. These challenges highlight the need for continued efforts towards novel therapeutic strategies for HCV. Over the past two decades, advances in HCV model systems have enabled a detailed understanding of HCV entry and its clinical impact. Many of the virus-host interactions involved in HCV entry have now been identified and explored as antiviral targets. Furthermore, viral entry is recognized as an important factor for graft reinfection and establishment of persistent infection. HCV entry inhibitors, therefore, offer promising opportunities to address the limitations of DAAs. Here, we summarize recent advances in the field of HCV entry and discuss perspectives towards the prevention and cure of HCV infection and virus-induced liver disease.",eng,Hepatology international,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The frame of reference has changed from a focus on 8 development priorities to an expansive set of 17 interrelated goals intended to improve the well-being of all people. In this time of change, several groups, including the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, have brought a critical problem to the fore: 5 billion people lack access to safe, affordable surgical and anaesthesia care when needed. The magnitude of this problem and the world's new focus on strengthening health systems mandate reimagined roles for and renewed commitments from high income country actors in global surgery. To discuss the way forward, on 6 May 2015, the Commission held its North American launch event in Boston, Massachusetts. Panels of experts outlined the current state of knowledge and agreed on the roles of surgical colleges and academic medical centres; trainees and training programmes; academia; global health funders; the biomedical devices industry, and news media and advocacy organisations in building sustainable, resilient surgical systems. This paper summarises these discussions and serves as a consensus statement providing practical advice to these groups. It traces a common policy agenda between major actors and provides a roadmap for maximising benefit to surgical patients worldwide. To close the access gap by 2030, individuals and organisations must work collectively, interprofessionally and globally. High income country actors must abandon colonial narratives and work alongside low and middle income country partners to build the surgical systems of the future.",eng,BMJ global health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27047773,10.14218/JCTH.2015.00041,Prevention and Treatment of Recurrent Hepatitis B after Liver Transplantation.,"Chronic hepatitis B is a global health problem that leads to development of various complications, such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure requiring liver transplantation. The recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) post-liver transplantation is a major cause of allograft dysfunction, cirrhosis of the allograft, and graft failure. Patients with high viral load at the time of transplantation, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positivity, or those with a history of anti-viral drug resistance are considered as high-risk for recurrent HBV post-liver transplantation, while patients with low viral load, including HBeAg negative status, acute liver failure, and hepatitis D virus (HDV) co-infection are considered to be at low-risk for recurrent HBV post-liver transplantation. Antivirals for patients awaiting liver transplantation(LT) cause suppression of HBV replication and reduce the risk of recurrent HBV infection of the allograft and, therefore, all HBV patients with decompensated cirrhosis should be treated with potent antivirals with high genetic barrier to resistance (entecavir or tenofovir) prior to liver transplantation. Prevention of post-liver transplantation recurrence should be done using a combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and antivirals in patients at high risk of recurrence. Low dose HBIG, HBIG-free protocols, and monoprophylaxis with high potency antivirals can still be considered in patients at low risk of recurrence. Even, marginal grafts from anti-HBc positive donors can be safely used in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative, preferably in anti-hepatitis B core (HBc)/anti-hepatitis B surface (HBs) positive recipients. In this article, we aim to review the mechanisms and risk factors of HBV recurrence post-LT in addition to the various treatment strategies proposed for the prevention of recurrent HBV infection.",eng,Journal of clinical and translational hepatology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of endogenous 5-HT through the activation of its specific receptor subtypes to the local and systemic inflammatory responses in an experimental model of IBD.--NEW SECTION--Colitis was induced by intrarectal 2,4,6-TriNitroBenzene Sulfonic acid in mice subacutely treated with selective antagonists of 5-HT1A (WAY100135), 5-HT2A (Ketanserin), 5-HT3 (Ondansetron), 5-HT4 (GR125487), 5-HT7 (SB269970) receptors and with 5-HT1A agonist 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin.--NEW SECTION--Blockade of 5-HT1A receptors worsened TNBS-induced local and systemic neutrophil recruitment while 5-HT1A agonist delayed and mitigated the severity of colitis, counteracting the increase in colonic 5-HT content. On the contrary, blockade of 5-HT2A receptors improved global health conditions, reduced colonic morphological alterations, down-regulated neutrophil recruitment, inflammatory cytokines levels and colonic apoptosis. Antagonism of 5-HT3, 5-HT4, and 5-HT7 receptor sites did not remarkably affect the progression and outcome of the pathology or only slightly improved it.--NEW SECTION--The prevailing deleterious contribution given by endogenous 5-HT to inflammation in TNBS-induced colitis is seemingly mediated by 5-HT2A and, to a lesser extent, by 5-HT4 receptors and coexists with the weak beneficial effect elicited by 5-HT1A stimulation. These findings suggest how only a selective interference with 5-HT pro-inflammatory actions may represent an additional potential therapeutic option for intestinal inflammatory disorders.",eng,Frontiers in pharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Many media reports attributed the excess deaths in part to the practice of daylight fasting during Ramadan. As much of the published research reports on heat-related mortality in Europe and the United States, an exploration of the effects of extreme heat on residents of a South Asian mega-city address a gap in current disaster research. Hypothesis/Problem This report investigated potential risk factors for excess mortality associated with the June 2015 heat wave in Karachi, Pakistan.--NEW SECTION--Data were obtained through manual review of death certificates at public hospitals and private clinics in Karachi, Pakistan, conducted from July 1 through July 31, 2015 by a trained physician. Demographic data for any deaths with a primary cause of death of heat-related illness were recorded in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp.; Redmond, Washington USA). EpiSheet (2012; Rothman. Modern Epidemiology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA) was used to calculate risk differences (RD), rate ratios (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).--NEW SECTION--Overall, residents of Karachi were approximately 17 times as likely to die of a heat-related cause of death during June 2015 (RR=17.68; 95% CI, 13.87-22.53) when compared with the reference period of June 2014. Residents with a monthly income lower than 20,000 Pakistani Rupees (US $196; RD=0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.05) and those with less than a fifth grade education (RD=0.03; 95% CI, 0.00-0.05) were at significantly higher risk of death during the 2015 heat wave compared to the reference period.--NEW SECTION--Fasting during Ramadan was not a significant risk factor for mortality from heat-related causes during the Karachi heat wave of June 2015. A large number of excess deaths were reported across all demographic groups, which due to the burden of record keeping in an under-resourced health system during a public health emergency, are almost certainly an underestimate.

Visceral fat, in particular the omentum and liver of obese individuals are sites of excessive inflammation. We propose that chemokine-mediated trafficking of pro-inflammatory cells to the omentum and liver contributes to local and subsequent systemic inflammation. Oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma (OAC) is an exemplar model of obesity and inflammation driven cancer. We have demonstrated that T cells actively migrate to the secreted factors from the omentum and liver of OAC patients and that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells bearing the chemokine receptor CCR5 are significantly more prevalent in these tissues compared to matched blood. The CCR5 ligand and inflammatory chemokine MIP-1α is also secreted at significantly higher concentrations in the omentum and liver of our OAC patient cohort compared to matched serum. Furthermore, we report that MIP-1α receptor antagonism can significantly reduce T cell migration to the secreted factors from OAC omentum and liver. These novel data suggest that chemokine receptor antagonism may have therapeutic potential to reduce inflammatory T cell infiltration to the omentum and liver and in doing so, may ameliorate pathological inflammation in obesity and obesity-associated cancer.",eng,Immunology and cell biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The concentrations of 24 elements were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in 24-h urine collections. Differences in the urinary excretion of metals were investigated between cases and controls, and the interaction with season was assessed.--NEW SECTION--Cases and controls were well matched regarding age, parity and duration of pregnancy.

The daily urinary excretions of 14 metals were significantly higher in women with preeclampsia than in control women, e.g. for lead: GM 61 μg/day (25(th)-75(th) percentile 8-345) in women with preeclampsia vs 9 μg/day (25(th)-75(th) percentile 3-21) in controls (p < 0.001). A significant interaction was found between season and preeclampsia for several elements, with higher urinary excretions in preeclamptic women than controls during the dry season, but not during the rainy season.--NEW SECTION--This study revealed not only that women with preeclampsia excrete higher amounts of several toxic metals, especially lead, than control women, but also that this excretion exhibits seasonal variation, thus possibly explaining the high incidence and seasonal variation of preeclampsia in Kinshasa.

Although researchers have applied epidemiologic transition theory to questions of global health, there have been relatively few studies exploring its relevance especially in the context of emerging allergic disorders in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this article, we address the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases in sub-Saharan Africa through the lens of epidemiologic transition theory. After a brief review of the literature on the evolution of the epidemiologic transition with a particular emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa, we discuss existing frameworks designed to help inform our understanding of changing health trends in the developing world. We subsequently propose a framework that privileges ""place"" as a key construct informing our understanding. In so doing, we use the example of allergic disease, one of the fastest growing chronic conditions in most parts of the world.",eng,Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27037144,10.1177/1090198116633455,Claim Your Space: Leadership Development as a Research Capacity Building Goal in Global Health.,"As the burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) rises in settings with an equally high burden of infectious diseases in the Global South, a new sense of urgency has developed around research capacity building to promote more effective and sustainable public health and health care systems. In 2010, NCDs accounted for more than 2.06 million deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Available evidence suggests that the number of people in sub-Saharan Africa with hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, will increase by 68% from 75 million in 2008 to 126 million in 2025. Furthermore, about 27.5 million people currently live with diabetes in Africa, and it is estimated that 49.7 million people living with diabetes will reside in Africa by 2030. It is therefore necessary to centralize leadership as a key aspect of research capacity building and strengthening in the Global South in ways that enables researchers to claim their spaces in their own locations. We believe that building capacity for transformative leadership in research will lead to the development of effective and appropriate responses to the multiple burdens of NCDs that coexist with infectious diseases in Africa and the rest of the Global South.",eng,Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Of particular interest, at a time when the EBOLA crisis highlights the weaknesses of health systems in resource-poor settings, the institutional resources and expertise of hospitals can also contribute to strengthening health systems with long-term sustainability.We describe a partnership network between French Hospitals and hospitals/health structures in 19 countries that demonstrates the power and efficacy of health partnership in the response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa and south East Asia. Through the ESTHER initiative, the partnership network currently provides capacity development, care and treatment to over 165,000 HIV-positive patients at 87 urban and 92 peripheral sites in 17 countries and enrolls 19,000 new HIV positive patients, delivers psychosocial services to 120 000 people and tests more than 35,000 pregnant women for HIV annually. It also, engages communities and assists with the development of a robust electronic information system.Launched in 2002, the ESTHER (Ensemble pour une Solidarite Thérapeutique Hospitalière En Reseau) initiative has grown from small projects with a focus on access to antiretroviral treatment in a limited number of West African countries at its outset into a large and comprehensive HIV/AIDS-control system in Western and Central Africa. The partnership's rapid achievements in the fight against HIV/AIDS, combined with the comprehensive and long-term approach to countries' health care needs, suggest that this ""twinning"" and medical mentoring model can and should be duplicated and developed to address the ever more pressing demand for response to global health needs in low resource countries.",eng,Globalization and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Inter-university health collaboration such as the Nottingham Trent University (UK) and Makerere University School of Public Health (Uganda) partnership provide opportunities for working together in training, research and service delivery while strengthening health systems. This paper shares the experiences, achievements and opportunities of this partnership in co-learning and supporting the health system in Uganda. This includes a project being implemented to strengthen the training, supervision and motivation of community health workers in rural Uganda. Training and research are a key focus of the partnership and have involved both staff and students of both institutions including guest lectures, seminars and conference presentations. The partnership's collaboration with stakeholders such as the Ministry of Health (Uganda) and local health authorities has ensured participation necessary in supporting implementation of sustainable interventions. The partnership uses several channels such as email, telephone, Skype, Dropbox and WhatsApp which have been useful in maintaining constant and effective communication. The challenges faced by the partnership include lack of funding to support student mobility, and varying academic schedules of the two institutions.

Of particular importance is the growing recognition of norovirus as a leading cause of gastroenteritis and diarrhea in countries where rotavirus vaccine has been introduced. While not as severe as rotavirus disease, the sheer number of norovirus infections not limited to early childhood makes norovirus a formidable global health problem. This article provides a landscape review of norovirus vaccine development efforts. Multiple vaccine strategies, mostly relying on virus-like particle antigens, are under development and have demonstrated proof of efficacy in human challenge studies. Several are entering phase 2 clinical development. Norovirus vaccine development challenges include, but are not limited to: valency, induction of adequate immune responses in pediatric and elderly populations, and potential for vaccine-strain mismatch. Given current strategies and global health interest, the outlook for a norovirus vaccine is promising. Because a norovirus vaccine is expected to have a dual market in both developed and developing countries, there would likely be scale-up advantages for commercial development and global distribution. Combination with or expression by another enteric pathogen, such as rotavirus, could also enhance uptake of a norovirus vaccine.",eng,Vaccine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Baseline and annual fasting glucose and insulin values were measured. Those experiencing an adverse event indicative of diabetes or starting medications for diabetes were considered to have confirmed diabetes. In addition, nondiabetic subjects with 2 annual follow-up glucose measurements were categorized into normal, impaired fasting glucose or newly diagnosed diabetes (presumed or confirmed) states.--NEW SECTION--Compared with placebo, ERN increased annual fasting glucose from baseline to 1 year in both those with normal (7.9 ± 15.8 vs 4.3 ± 10.3 mg/dL; P < .001) and impaired fasting glucose (4.1 ± 18.7 vs 1.4 ± 14.9; P < .02) and increased insulin levels. Both effects waned over the next 2 years. There were less consistent effects in those with baseline diabetes. There was an increased risk of progressing from normal to presumed or confirmed impaired fasting glucose (ERN 197/336) cases (58.6%) vs placebo 135/325 cases (41.5%; P < .001) over time, but no difference in diabetes development in the 2 treatment groups except in those with normal fasting glucose at baseline.--NEW SECTION--The addition of ERN to simvastatin/ezetimibe had marginal effects on glycemia in those with diabetes at baseline, and there was a trend toward increased development of new-onset diabetes. In addition, ERN increased the risk of developing impaired fasting glucose, which may have deleterious consequences over time and warrants further study.",eng,The American journal of medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Roles of its NS1 protein, an essential viral factor, in regulating apoptosis remain unknown.--NEW SECTION--Apoptotic effect and features of H7N9/NS1 in the human A549 alveolar basal epithelial cell line were examined by caspase 3/7 activity assay and western blotting of apoptotic associated proteins. Effects of H7N9/NS1on mitochondrial membrane potential were investigated by flow cytometry.--NEW SECTION--The expression of H7N9/NS1 in A549 cells activated caspase 3/7 and increased the protein levels of cleaved caspase 7 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). H7N9/NS1-expressing A549 cells displayed a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, H7N9/NS1 increased the protein levels of total p53, p53 phosphorylated at Ser46 and Ser37, activated caspase 9, and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.--NEW SECTION--Our results suggest that H7N9/NS1 protein causes the accumulation of p53 by increasing phosphorylation levels of p53 and the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction, which may contribute to H7N9/NS1-induced apoptosis in A549 cells.",eng,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The current study was undertaken to evaluate conventional and molecular diagnostic assays for the detection of mycobacteria in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region of Pakistan. A total of 259 clinically suspected patients of TB were processed for Zeihl Neelsen (ZN) microscopy, BACTEC MGIT liquid culture and GeneXpert assay. Among 259 samples, 28 (10.81%) were positive for acid fast bacilli (AFB) on ZN microscopy. In liquid culture, the growth of mycobacterium species was obtained in 36 (13.89%) samples while the GeneXpert assay detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in 49 (18.91%) samples. Detection rate of MTB was significantly high (n = 49, p < 0.0095) on GeneXpert as compared to microscopy (n = 28); however no significant difference (p = 0.1230) was observed on GeneXpert (n = 49) and culture (n = 36) based detection of MTB. The strength of agreement between GeneXpert and microscopy was also poor (Kappa value < 0.114, 95% CI: -0.72 - 0.301) which support our results. MTB detection rate among female was high as compared to male TB patients while in age wise, the age group 55-64 years has almost high detection rate on microscopy, culture and GeneXpert assay.

Despite decades of research efforts, no licensed vaccine for RSV is available. We have developed virus-like particle (VLP)-based RSV vaccines assembled with the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) matrix protein (M) as the structural scaffold and the RSV fusion glycoprotein (F) in either the postfusion or prefusion conformation as its prime surface immunogen. Vaccines were composed of postfusion F, prefusion F, or a combination of the two conformations and formulated with a squalene-based oil emulsion as adjuvant. Immunization with these VLP vaccines afforded full protection against RSV infection and prevented detectable viral replication in the mouse lung after challenge. Analyses of lung cytokines and chemokines showed that VLP vaccination mostly induced the production of gamma interferon (IFN-γ), a marker of the Th1-mediated immune response, which is predominantly required for viral protection. Conversely, immunization with a formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine induced high levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines of the Th2- and Th17-mediated types of immune responses, as well as severe lung inflammation and histopathology. The VLP vaccines showed restricted production of these immune mediators and did not induce severe bronchiolitis or perivascular infiltration as seen with the FI-RSV vaccine. Remarkably, analysis of the serum from immunized mice showed that the VLP vaccine formulated using a combination of postfusion and prefusion F elicited the highest level of neutralizing antibody and enhanced the Th1-mediated immune response.",eng,Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

They have historically been very difficult to treat, and advanced NETs are considered incurable. Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment option, though research is ongoing, investigating the efficacy of targeted therapies combined with more traditional chemotherapies. Frequent bowel movements and episodes of flushing are the most common symptoms.--NEW SECTION--The present study reports data from an anonymous patient survey of 663 eligible NET patients, identified with the assistance of patient advocacy groups. This study investigated the impact of treatment (surgery alone; surgery plus somatostatin analogue; other treatments) on quality of life (QOL). Finally, we investigate whether recurrent disease results in poorer QOL compared to disease treated curatively with surgery and remaining in remission.--NEW SECTION--Results suggest that increased frequency of bowel movements and presence of any flushing symptoms are correlated with decreased quality of life. Treatment groups differed on most Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) global health and PROMIS-29 scores, including physical function, fatigue, pain, social function, and general physical and mental health, with the surgery group reporting significantly better scores than the other groups (effect size of differences ranged from 0.28 to 0.54). This may be possibly due to effective symptom control reached for these patients through surgery alone. After adjustment for carcinoid syndrome, the association with the treatment group disappeared for all domains except physical functioning. In terms of disease status, patients with recurrent disease reported poorer physical, social, and mental functions. Depression scores were similar between groups; however, patients with recurrent disease reported significantly higher anxiety compared to those with no current NET. Physical functioning was even more markedly different between groups, with recurrent NET patients reporting significantly impaired overall physical function, impaired sleep, and significant fatigue compared to those with no current NET.

The hallmark feature of dementia is that of irreversible cognitive decline, usually affecting memory, and impaired activities of daily living. Advances in healthcare worldwide have facilitated longer life spans, increasing the risks of developing cognitive decline and dementia in late life. Dementia remains a clinical diagnosis. The role of structural and molecular neuroimaging in patients with dementia is primarily supportive role rather than diagnostic, American and European guidelines recommending imaging to exclude treatable causes of dementia, such as tumor, hydrocephalus or intracranial haemorrhage, but also to distinguish between different dementia subtypes, the commonest of which is Alzheimer's disease. However, this depends on the availability of these imaging techniques at individual centres. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, such as functional connectivity MRI, diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and molecular imaging techniques, such as 18F fluoro-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography (PET), amyloid PET, tau PET, are currently within the realm of dementia research but are available for clinical use.

Many recent studies have attempted to define links between microbiota residents, their function and the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut microbiota drive the development of inflammation within the colon and such inflammation is implicated in colonic neoplastic development. Although the precise mechanisms through which the microbiota is involved in cancer development remain elusive, the message is clear: the microbiota contributes to cancer risk by influencing a number of key host processes. It is also recognized that we have the ability to influence the role of the gut microbiota by considering our nutritional intake. We have always known that 'we are what we eat' but it is also true that 'they (our gut microbiota) are what we eat'. We therefore have a huge opportunity to positively influence our health through microbial manipulation. There is now a clear need to move past defining the constituents of the gastrointestinal microbiota and to focus more on understanding the functional capabilities of the resident microbial community and how this impacts on host health. One such emerging concept is the development of microbial biofilms which can form in the gut in conjunction with CRC tissue. By better understanding of the interaction between the host and its resident microbiota, in the context of health and cancer development, we will open new therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities for reducing the CRC global health burden.",eng,"Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We identified articles from 2010 to 2014 that had cited global estimates for at least one of ten indicators [prevalence and numbers infected with HBV, HCV, HIV-HBV or HIV-HCV co-infection, and mortality (number of deaths annually) for HBV and HCV]. Overall, 488 articles were retrieved: 239 articles cited a HBV-related global estimate [prevalence (n = 12), number infected (n = 193) and number of annual deaths (n = 82)]; 280 articles had HCV-related global estimates [prevalence (n = 86), number infected (n = 203) and number of annual deaths (n = 31)]; 31 had estimates on both HBV and HCV; 54 had HIV-HBV co-infection estimates [prevalence (n = 42) and number co-infected (n = 12)]; and 68 had estimates for HIV-HCV co-infection [prevalence (n = 40) and number co-infected (n = 28)]. There was considerable heterogeneity in the estimates cited and also a lack of consistency in the terminology used. Although 40% of 488 articles cited WHO as the source of the estimate, many of these were from outdated or secondary sources.

Subsequently, immunization was endorsed as a cost-effective technical intervention to combat targeted infectious diseases. Multilateral efforts to collaborate on immunization as a universal public health good ambiguously capture the interests of the world's governments as well as private, public, and not-for-profit institutions. Global assemblages of scientists, governments, industry and nongovernmental organizations now work in public-private partnerships to develop and make essential vaccines accessible, with vaccines marketed as single fix solutions for global health. Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork in France and Burkina Faso that followed the development, regulation, and implementation of the group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine for sub-Saharan Africa, in this article I describe events during and after the development of MenAfriVac.

The risk of in-utero HIV-1 transmission in the absence of interventions is ∼7%. This low rate of transmission points to innate and adaptive mechanisms to restrict lentiviral infection within the placenta.--NEW SECTION--Placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells) are key mediators in in-utero transmission of HIV-1. Hofbauer cells constitutively express elevated concentrations of regulatory cytokines, which inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro, and possess intrinsic antiviral properties. Hofbauer cells sequester HIV-1 in intracellular compartments that can be accessed by HIV-1-specific antibodies and may occur in vivo to offset MTCT. Intriguingly, studies have reported strong associations between maternal human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) viremia and MTCT of HIV-1. HCMV infection at the placenta promotes inflammation, chronic villitis, and trophoblast damage, providing potential HIV-1 access into CD4CCR5 target cells. The placenta exhibits a variety of mechanisms to limit HIV-1 replication, yet viral-induced activation with maternal HCMV may override this protection to facilitate in-utero transmission of HIV-1.--NEW SECTION--Understanding immune correlates of protection or transmission at the placenta during on-going HIV-1 exposure may contribute to understanding HIV pathogenesis and the development of effective immunotherapies.",eng,Current opinion in infectious diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We report a spinal trauma case that was performed using minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and navigation, and hypothesize that these newer techniques may enable surgeons to perform effective spinal surgery with minimal complications and good outcomes.  During the 2014 First Hands-on Neurotrauma Course held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we successfully performed three minimally invasive and two-dimensional (2D) navigated spinal surgeries to decompress and stabilize patients with complete and incomplete spinal injuries. In this report, we present a case of a paraplegic patient with a T12 burst fracture who tolerated MIS surgery with no intraoperative complications, and is doing well with no postoperative complications one year after surgery. Minimally invasive spinal surgery and 2D navigation may offer advantages in resource-poor countries. As part of the Weill Cornell Tanzania Neurosurgery project and in conjunction with the Foundation for International Education in Neurological Surgery (as well as other organizations), further experiences with 2D navigation and MIS surgery will be recorded in 2015.

This review addresses the recent findings on anemia in surgical patients and its significance in perioperative setting.--NEW SECTION--The prevalence of anemia in surgical populations is high, ranging from one-third of population to nearly 100%. Anemia is an independent, modifiable risk factor for a growing list of unfavorable events, complications and diminished functional outcomes (lasting for months following discharge), as well as a major predisposing factor for allogeneic blood transfusions. Therefore, timely screening and diagnosis of anemia prior to elective surgeries is of great importance. Nonetheless, studies suggest that many opportunities to properly manage anemia in perioperative setting are lost. Patient blood management provides a framework of evidence-based strategies to effectively reduce the risk of occurrence of anemia and treat it with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes. Studies on the clinical impact of patient blood management strategies are emerging.--NEW SECTION--Active screening for anemia and proper management of it in perioperative setting is essential.

27018130,10.1002/jat.3300,Arsenic inhibits mast cell degranulation via suppression of early tyrosine phosphorylation events.,"Exposure to arsenic is a global health concern. We previously documented an inhibitory effect of inorganic Arsenite on IgE-mediated degranulation of RBL-2H3 mast cells (Hutchinson et al., 2011; J. Appl. Toxicol. 31: 231-241). Mast cells are tissue-resident cells that are positioned at the host-environment interface, thereby serving vital roles in many physiological processes and disease states, in addition to their well-known roles in allergy and asthma. Upon activation, mast cells secrete several mediators from cytoplasmic granules, in degranulation. The present study is an investigation of Arsenite's molecular target(s) in the degranulation pathway. Here, we report that arsenic does not affect degranulation stimulated by either the Ca(2) (+) ionophore A23187 or thapsigargin, which both bypass early signaling events. Arsenic also does not alter degranulation initiated by another non-IgE-mediated mast cell stimulant, the G-protein activator compound 48/80. However, arsenic inhibits Ca(2) (+) influx into antigen-activated mast cells. These results indicate that the target of arsenic in the degranulation pathway is upstream of the Ca(2) (+) influx. Phospho-Syk and phospho-p85 phosphoinositide 3-kinase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays data show that arsenic inhibits early phosphorylation events. Taken together, this evidence indicates that the mechanism underlying arsenic inhibition of mast cell degranulation occurs at the early tyrosine phosphorylation steps in the degranulation pathway.

27017824,10.1093/heapol/czw009,Did PEPFAR investments result in health system strengthening? A retrospective longitudinal study measuring non-HIV health service utilization at the district level.,"OBJECTIVES : PEPFAR's initial rapid scale-up approach was largely a vertical effort focused fairly exclusively on AIDS. The purpose of our research was to identify spill-over health system effects, if any, of investments intended to stem the HIV epidemic over a 6-year period with evidence from Uganda. The test of whether there were health system expansions (aside from direct HIV programming) was evidence of increases in utilization of non-HIV services-such as outpatient visits, in-facility births or immunizations-that could be associated with varying levels of PEPFAR investments at the district level. METHODS : Uganda's Health Management Information System article-based records were available from mid-2005 onwards. We visited all 112 District Health offices to collect routine monthly reports (which contain data aggregated from monthly facility reports) and annual reports (which contain data aggregated from annual facility reports). Counts of individuals on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) at year-end served as our primary predictor variable. We grouped district-months into tertiles of high, medium or low PEPFAR investment based on their total reported number of patients on ART at the end of the year. We generated incidence-rate ratios, interpreted as the relative rate of the outcome measure in relation to the lowest investment PEPFAR tertile, holding constant control variables in the model. RESULTS : We found PEPFAR investment overall was associated with small declines in service volumes in several key areas of non-HIV care (outpatient care for young children, TB tests and in-facility deliveries), after adjusting for sanitation, elementary education and HIV prevalence. For example, districts with medium and high ART investment had 11% fewer outpatient visits for children aged 4 and younger compared with low investment districts, incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.89 for high investment compared with low (95% CI, 0.85-0.94) and IRR of 0.93 for medium compared with low (0.90-0.96). Similarly, 22% fewer TB sputum tests were performed in high investment districts compared with low investment, [IRR 0.78 (0.72-0.85)] and 13% fewer in medium compared with low, [IRR 0.88 (0.83-0.94)]. Districts with medium and high ART investment had 5% fewer in-facility deliveries compared with low investment districts [IRR 0.95 for high compared with low, (91-1.00) and 0.96 for medium compared with low (0.93-0.99)]. Although not statistically significant, the rate of maternal deaths in high investment district-months was 13% lower than observed in low investment districts. CONCLUSIONS : This study sought to understand whether PEPFAR, as a vertical programme, may have had a spill-over effect on the health system generally, as measured by utilization. Our conclusion is that it did not, at least not in Uganda.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27017613,10.1007/s00395-016-0543-8,Understanding STAT3 signaling in cardiac ischemia.,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. It remains one of the greatest challenges to global health and will continue to dominate mortality trends in the future. Acute myocardial infarction results in 7.4 million deaths globally per annum. Current management strategies are centered on restoration of coronary blood flow via percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting and administration of anti-platelet agents. Such myocardial reperfusion accounts for 40-50 % of the final infarct size in most cases. Signaling transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been shown to have cardioprotective effects via canonical and non-canonical activation and modulation of mitochondrial and transcriptional responses. A significant body of in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that activation of the STAT3 signal transduction pathway results in a cardio protective response to ischemia and attempts have been made to modulate this with therapeutic effect. Not only is STAT3 important for cardiomyocyte function, but it also modulates the cardiac microenvironment and communicates with cardiac fibroblasts. To this end, we here review the current evidence supporting the manipulation of STAT3 for therapeutic benefit in cardiac ischemia and identify areas for future research.",eng,Basic research in cardiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that millions of cases of ZIKV are likely to occur in the Americas during the next 12 months. These projections, in conjunction with suspected Zika-associated increase in newborn microcephaly cases, prompted WHO to declare public health emergency of international concern. ZIKV-associated illness is characterized by an incubation period of 3-12 days. Most patients remain asymptomatic (i.e., ~80%) after contracting the virus. When symptomatic, clinical presentation is usually mild and consists of a self-limiting febrile illness that lasts approximately 2-7 days. Among common clinical manifestations are fever, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, myalgia, headache, and maculopapular rash. Hospitalization and complication rates are low, with fatalities being extremely rare. Newborn microcephaly, the most devastating and insidious complication associated with the ZIKV, has been described in the offspring of women who became infected while pregnant. Much remains to be elucidated about the timing of ZIKV infection in the context of the temporal progression of pregnancy, the corresponding in utero fetal development stage(s), and the risk of microcephaly. Without further knowledge of the pathophysiology involved, the true risk of ZIKV to the unborn remains difficult to quantify and remediate. Accurate, portable, and inexpensive point-of-care testing is required to better identify cases and manage the current and future outbreaks of ZIKV, including optimization of preventive approaches and the identification of more effective risk reduction strategies. In addition, much more work needs to be done to produce an effective vaccine. Given the rapid geographic spread of ZIKV in recent years, a coordinated local, regional, and global effort is needed to generate sufficient resources and political traction to effectively halt and contain further expansion of the current outbreak.",eng,Journal of global infectious diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Broilers are an important reservoir of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in general and, more particularly, extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)/AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Since contamination of 1-day-old chicks is a potential risk factor for the introduction of antimicrobial resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the broiler production chain, the presence of antimicrobial resistant coliform bacteria in broiler hatching eggs was explored in the present study. Samples from 186 hatching eggs, collected from 11 broiler breeder farms, were inoculated on MacConkey agar with or without ceftiofur and investigated for the presence of antimicrobial resistant lactose-positive Enterobacteriaceae, particularly, ESBL/AmpC-producers. Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae were obtained from the eggshells in 10 out of 11 (10/11) sampled farms. The majority of the isolates were recovered from crushed eggshells after external decontamination suggesting that these bacteria are concealed from the disinfectants in the egg shell pores. Antimicrobial resistance testing revealed that approximately 30% of the isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim and sulphonamides, while the majority of isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, nitrofurantoin, aminoglycosides, florfenicol, neomycin and apramycin. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was detected in eight Enterobacteriaceae isolates from five different broiler breeder farms.

Preparing outbreak response plans and assessing potential vaccine needs from an emergency stockpile require consideration of the different national risks and conditions as they change with time after OPV cessation.--NEW SECTION--We used an integrated global model to consider several key issues related to managing poliovirus risks and outbreak response, including the time interval during which monovalent OPV (mOPV) can be safely used following homotypic OPV cessation; the timing, quality, and quantity of rounds required to stop transmission; vaccine stockpile needs; and the impacts of vaccine choices and surveillance quality. We compare the base case scenario that assumes aggressive outbreak response and sufficient mOPV available from the stockpile for all outbreaks that occur in the model, with various scenarios that change the outbreak response strategies.--NEW SECTION--Outbreak response after OPV cessation will require careful management, with some circumstances expected to require more and/or higher quality rounds to stop transmission than others. For outbreaks involving serotype 2, using trivalent OPV instead of mOPV2 following cessation of OPV serotype 2 but before cessation of OPV serotypes 1 and 3 would represent a good option if logistically feasible. Using mOPV for outbreak response can start new outbreaks if exported outside the outbreak population into populations with decreasing population immunity to transmission after OPV cessation, but failure to contain outbreaks resulting in exportation of the outbreak poliovirus may represent a greater risk. The possibility of mOPV use generating new long-term poliovirus excretors represents a real concern. Using the base case outbreak response assumptions, we expect over 25% probability of a shortage of stockpiled filled mOPV vaccine, which could jeopardize the achievement of global polio eradication. For the long term, responding to any poliovirus reintroductions may require a global IPV stockpile. Despite the risks, our model suggests that good risk management and response strategies can successfully control most potential outbreaks after OPV cessation.--NEW SECTION--Health leaders should carefully consider the numerous outbreak response choices that affect the probability of successfully managing poliovirus risks after OPV cessation.",eng,BMC infectious diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Whole genome association studies are being applied to identify genetic determinants of resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs. Protein structure and interaction modelling are used to understand the functional effects of putative mutations and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms leading to resistance.--NEW SECTION--To investigate the potential utility of these approaches, we analysed the genomes of 144 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from The Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) collection sourced from 20 countries in four continents. A genome-wide approach was applied to 127 isolates to identify polymorphisms associated with minimum inhibitory concentrations for first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. In addition, the effect of identified candidate mutations on protein stability and interactions was assessed quantitatively with well-established computational methods.--NEW SECTION--The analysis revealed that mutations in the genes rpoB (rifampicin), katG (isoniazid), inhA-promoter (isoniazid), rpsL (streptomycin) and embB (ethambutol) were responsible for the majority of resistance observed. A subset of the mutations identified in rpoB and katG were predicted to affect protein stability. Further, a strong direct correlation was observed between the minimum inhibitory concentration values and the distance of the mutated residues in the three-dimensional structures of rpoB and katG to their respective drugs binding sites.--NEW SECTION--Using the TDR resource, we demonstrate the usefulness of whole genome association and convergent evolution approaches to detect known and potentially novel mutations associated with drug resistance. Further, protein structural modelling could provide a means of predicting the impact of polymorphisms on drug efficacy in the absence of phenotypic data.

We prospectively evaluated the chronological changes in QoL after a gastrectomy over a 5-year postoperative period in a large group of patients.--NEW SECTION--QoL data from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-STO22 questionnaires were obtained from 254 patients who completed the entire series of QoL assessments preoperatively and at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after surgery.--NEW SECTION--There was no statistically significant change in global health status/QoL during the 5-year postoperative period. Decreases in QoL from upper gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea (p < 0.001), dysphagia (p < 0.001), reflux symptoms (p=0.029), and eating restrictions (p < 0.001) were observed among the long-term survivors. Decreased physical functioning (p < 0.001), role functioning (p < 0.001), and cognitive functioning (p < 0.001), along with fatigue (p=0.045) and a poor body image (p=0.003), negatively impacted the patients' QoL for a long time.--NEW SECTION--Management of gastrointestinal symptoms should be specifically targeted as a part of long-term patient care after a gastrectomy. Proper nutritional care will improve food intake resulting in weight gain and improved physical functioning, role functioning, and body image. In addition, patients should be encouraged to preserve self-esteem and maintain social activity.",eng,Cancer research and treatment,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
27004841,10.1186/s12916-016-0598-2,Clinical use of whole genome sequencing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) remains a major challenge to global health and to healthcare in the UK. In 2014, a total of 6,520 cases of TB were recorded in England, of which 1.4 % were multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) occurs at a much lower rate, but the impact on the patient and hospital is severe. Current diagnostic methods such as drug susceptibility testing and targeted molecular tests are slow to return or examine only a limited number of target regions, respectively. Faster, more comprehensive diagnostics will enable earlier use of the most appropriate drug regimen, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing overall healthcare costs. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been shown to provide a rapid and comprehensive view of the genotype of the organism, and thus enable reliable prediction of the drug susceptibility phenotype within a clinically relevant timeframe. In addition, it provides the highest resolution when investigating transmission events in possible outbreak scenarios. However, robust software and database tools need to be developed for the full potential to be realized in this specialized area of medicine.",eng,BMC medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

They completed Life Orientation Scale, The Hope Scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaires. The data regarding the knowledge of illness progression and the perceptions of therapy intent were assessed using self-administered open-ended questionnaires that were answered by the patients.--NEW SECTION--The data revealed that 58.2 % of the patients had an inaccurate perception of treatment intent, believing the aim of treatment was cure, whereas only 38.2 % of the patients had a realistic expectation that their disease may remain stable or may progress over a year. In addition, the awareness of disease progression and perception of goals of treatment was significantly related to hope and optimism scores but not to QoL.--NEW SECTION--A large proportion of patients diagnosed with advanced breast cancer believed that their treatment was ""curative"", and they would improve within a year.

A recent epidemic in the Indian subcontinent (ISC) caused up to 80% of global VL and over 30,000 deaths per year. Resistance against antimonial drugs has probably been a contributing factor in the persistence of this epidemic. Here we use whole genome sequences from 204 clinical isolates to track the evolution and epidemiology of L. donovani from the ISC. We identify independent radiations that have emerged since a bottleneck coincident with 1960s DDT spraying campaigns. A genetically distinct population frequently resistant to antimonials has a two base-pair insertion in the aquaglyceroporin gene LdAQP1 that prevents the transport of trivalent antimonials. We find evidence of genetic exchange between ISC populations, and show that the mutation in LdAQP1 has spread by recombination. Our results reveal the complexity of L. donovani evolution in the ISC in response to drug treatment.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Study quality was assessed using the risk of bias assessment tool from the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, and the evidence base was assessed using the GRADE tool. Eight studies in seven cohorts (two from high-income countries, five from low-middle-income countries) met the inclusion criteria for short-term (mean age: 13.4 months) and/or longer-term (mean age: 11.1 years) health outcomes of catch-up growth, which had occurred by 24 or 59 months. Of five studies on short-term health outcomes, three found positive associations between weight catch-up growth and body mass and/or glucose metabolism; one suggested reduced risk of hospitalisation and mortality with catch-up growth. Three studies on longer-term health outcomes found catch-up growth were associated with higher body mass, BMI or cholesterol. GRADE assessment suggested that evidence quantity and quality were low. Catch-up growth following LBW may have benefits for the individual with LBW in the short term, and may have adverse population health impacts in the long-term, but the evidence is limited. Future cohort studies could address the question of the consequences of catch-up growth following LBW more convincingly, with a view to informing future prevention of obesity and NCDs. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",eng,Maternal & child nutrition,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017
27001851,10.1073/pnas.1523119113,Analysis and valuation of the health and climate change cobenefits of dietary change.,"What we eat greatly influences our personal health and the environment we all share. Recent analyses have highlighted the likely dual health and environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets. Here, we couple for the first time, to our knowledge, a region-specific global health model based on dietary and weight-related risk factors with emissions accounting and economic valuation modules to quantify the linked health and environmental consequences of dietary changes. We find that the impacts of dietary changes toward less meat and more plant-based diets vary greatly among regions. The largest absolute environmental and health benefits result from diet shifts in developing countries whereas Western high-income and middle-income countries gain most in per capita terms. Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6-10% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29-70% compared with a reference scenario in 2050. We find that the monetized value of the improvements in health would be comparable with, or exceed, the value of the environmental benefits although the exact valuation method used considerably affects the estimated amounts. Overall, we estimate the economic benefits of improving diets to be 1-31 trillion US dollars, which is equivalent to 0.4-13% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050. However, significant changes in the global food system would be necessary for regional diets to match the dietary patterns studied here.",eng,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Summary incident risk (IR) and prevalent risk for each OI in ART-naive and ART-exposed children were calculated, and unadjusted odds ratios calculated for impact of ART. The number of OI cases and associated costs averted were estimated using the AIDS impact model.--NEW SECTION--We identified 4542 citations, and 88 studies were included, comprising 55 679 HIV-infected children. Bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis were the most common incident and prevalent infections in both ART-naive and ART-exposed children. There was a significant reduction in IR with ART for the majority of OIs. There was a smaller impact on bacterial sepsis and pneumonia, and an increase observed for varicella zoster. ART initiation based on 2010 World Health Organization guidelines criteria for ART initiation in children was estimated to potentially avert >161 000 OIs (2013 UNAIDS data) with estimated cost savings of at least US$17 million per year.--NEW SECTION--There is a decrease in the risk of most OIs with ART use in HIV-infected children in LMICs, and estimated large potential cost savings in OIs averted with ART use, although there are greater uncertainties in pediatric data compared with that of adults.",eng,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Endothelin (ET)-1 is an important pro-inflammatory factor in the airways, which acts as a chemoattractant and an upregulator of other inflammatory mediators. In the present study, the association of the sputum ET-1 level with active pulmonary TB and the effectiveness of anti-TB chemotherapy was explored for the first time. A total of 56 newly diagnosed patients with active pulmonary TB, 56 age- and gender-matched TB-free controls, and 43 subjects with latent TB were recruited to the study. Patients in the active TB group received standard anti-TB chemotherapy. Sputum samples were collected from all study subjects at baseline (day 0) and on days 1, 2, 4, 6, 10 and 14 of treatment for the active TB group and the ET-1 level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The sputum ET-1 level in the active TB group was significantly higher than those in the latent TB and the non-TB groups at baseline. Following adjustment for confounders such as age, gender, severity of clinical presentation, plasma ET-1 level and comorbidities that might affect the sputum ET-1 level, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that sputum ET-1 level was an independent indicator for active pulmonary TB. In the active TB group during anti-TB chemotherapy, decrements in the sputum ET-1 level were in significant correlation with decrements in the number of colony-forming units and increments in the time to positivity in a Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube assay. In conclusion, this study indicates that an elevated sputum ET-1 level is an independent indicator of active pulmonary TB and suggests that decrements in the sputum ET-1 level could reflect the effectiveness of anti-TB chemotherapy.",eng,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Breast cancer, the most typical cancer diagnosed among women, remains a global health problem. In this study, the anti-breast cancer property of cordycepin and its underlying mechanisms was investigated. The direct effects of cordycepin on breast cancer cells both in in vitro and in vivo experiments were evaluated. Cordycepin exerted cytotoxicity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells confirmed by reduced cell viability, inhibition of cell proliferation, enhanced lactate dehydrogenase release and reactive oxygen species accumulation, induced mitochondrial dysfunction and nuclear apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Cordycepin increased the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, including caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3 and Bax, and suppressed the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). The inhibition on MCF-7-xenografted tumor growth in nude mice further confirmed cordycepin's anti-breast cancer effect.

Stand-alone environmental interventions appeared more promising in reducing BLL (three UBA). Combining educational and environmental interventions and targeting multiple settings may be effective in reducing BLL, as suggested by one uncontrolled before-after study. No studies examining the effectiveness of regulatory interventions were found.--NEW SECTION--The limited quantity and quality of the evidence measuring BLL and associated health outcomes points to an urgent need for more robust research into the effectiveness of interventions to reduce lead exposure from consumer products and drinking water, especially for regulatory interventions.",eng,Environmental research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Acute ethanol intoxication is characterized by hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, which could be promoted by gut barrier function alterations. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis of the hepatoprotective effect of rhubarb extract in a mouse model of binge drinking and we explored the contribution of the gut microbiota in the related metabolic effects.--NEW SECTION--Mice were fed a control diet supplemented with or without 0.3% rhubarb extract for 17 days and were necropsied 6 h after an alcohol challenge. Supplementation with rhubarb extract changed the microbial ecosystem (assessed by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing) in favor of Akkermansia muciniphila and Parabacteroides goldsteinii. Furthermore, it improved alcohol-induced hepatic injury, downregulated key markers of both inflammatory and oxidative stresses in the liver tissue, without affecting significantly steatosis. In the gut, rhubarb supplementation increased crypt depth, tissue weight, and the expression of antimicrobial peptides.--NEW SECTION--These findings suggest that some bacterial genders involved in gut barrier function, are promoted by phytochemicals present in rhubarb extract, and could therefore be involved in the modulation of the susceptibility to hepatic diseases linked to acute alcohol consumption.",eng,Molecular nutrition & food research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

Cardiac fibroblasts comprise an essential cell type in the heart that is responsible for the homeostasis of the extracellular matrix; however, upon injury, these cells transform to a myofibroblast phenotype and contribute to cardiac fibrosis. This remodeling involves pathological changes that include chamber dilation, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis, and ultimately leads to the progression to heart failure. Despite the critical importance of fibrosis in cardiovascular disease, our limited understanding of the cardiac fibroblast impedes the development of potential therapies that effectively target this cell type and its pathological contribution to disease progression. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the origins and roles of fibroblasts, mediators and signaling pathways known to influence fibroblast function after myocardial injury, as well as novel therapeutic strategies under investigation to attenuate cardiac fibrosis.",eng,Circulation research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Methods Qualitative research carried out in the city of Natal (Northeast Brazil), with semi-structured interviews with 120 subjects (19 key informer health professionals and 101 TA victims) identified in a database made available by the emergency hospital. The interviews were analyzed using Alceste software, version 4.9. Results The main barriers present in the interviews were: (1) related to services: bureaucratic administrative practises, low offer of rehabilitation services, insufficient information on rehabilitation, lack of guidelines that integrate hospital and ambulatory care and (2) related to patients: financial difficulties, functional limitations, geographic distance, little information on health, association with low education levels and disbelief in the system and in rehabilitation. Conclusion The numerous access barriers were presented in a theoretical model with causes related to organizational structure, processes of care, professionals and patients. This model must be tested by health policy-makers and managers to improve the quality of physical rehabilitation and avoid unnecessary prolongation of the suffering and disability experienced by TA survivors. Implications for rehabilitation Traffic accidents (TAs) are a global health dilemma that demands integrality of preventive actions, pre-hospital and hospital care and physical rehabilitation (PR). This study lays the foundation for improving access to PR for TA survivors, an issue of quality of care that results in preventable disabilities. The words of the patients interviewed reveal the suffering of victims, which is often invisible to society and given low priority by health policies that relegate PR to a second plan ahead of prevention and urgent care. A theoretical model of the causes of the problem of access to PR was built. The identified barriers are potentially preventable through the intervention of health policy-makers, managers, regulators and rehabilitation professionals, and by encouraging the participation of patients. Addressing timely access barriers involves the expansion of the supply of services and rehabilitation professionals, regulation and standardization of referencing practises and encouraging the provision of information to patients about continuity of care and their health needs.",eng,Disability and rehabilitation,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

They proffered recommendations in five areas of training curriculum: values, competencies, training experiences, resources, and evaluation.--NEW SECTION--Priority values included humility, ethical awareness of power differentials, collaborative action, and ""deep accountability"" when working in low-resource settings in low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Competencies included flexibility and tolerating ambiguity when working across diverse settings, the ability to systematically evaluate personal biases, historical and linguistic proficiency, and evaluation skills across a range of stakeholders. Training experiences included didactics, language training, self-awareness, and supervision in immersive activities related to professional or academic work. Resources included connections with diverse faculty such as social scientists and mentors in addition to medical practitioners, institutional commitment through protected time and funding, and sustainable collaborations with partners in low resource settings. Finally, evaluation skills built upon community-based participatory methods, 360-degree feedback from partners in low-resource settings, and observed structured clinical evaluations (OSCEs) with people of different cultural backgrounds.--NEW SECTION--Global mental health training, as envisioned in this workshop, exemplifies an ethos of working through power differentials across clinical, professional, and social contexts in order to form longstanding collaborations. If incorporated into the ACGME/ABPN Psychiatry Milestone Project, such recommendations will improve training gained through international experiences as well as the everyday training of mental health professionals, global health practitioners, and social scientists.",eng,Academic psychiatry : the journal of the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training and the Association for Academic Psychiatry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26982804,10.1371/journal.pone.0149669,Beyond Attributable Burden: Estimating the Avoidable Burden of Disease Associated with Household Air Pollution.,"The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies have transformed global understanding of health risks by producing comprehensive estimates of attributable disease burden, or the current disease that would be eliminated if a risk factor did not exist. Yet many have noted the greater policy significance of avoidable burden, or the future disease that could actually be eliminated if a risk factor were eliminated today. Avoidable risk may be considerably lower than attributable risk if baseline levels of exposure or disease are declining, or if a risk factor carries lagged effects on disease. As global efforts to deliver clean cookstoves accelerate, a temporal estimation of avoidable risk due to household air pollution (HAP) becomes increasingly important, particularly in light of the rapid uptake of modern stoves and ongoing epidemiologic transitions in regions like South and Southeast Asia.--NEW SECTION--We estimate the avoidable burden associated with HAP using International Futures (IFs), an integrated forecasting system that has been used to model future global disease burdens and risk factors. Building on GBD and other estimates, we integrated a detailed HAP exposure estimation and exposure-response model into IFs. We then conducted a counterfactual experiment in which HAP exposure is reduced to theoretical minimum levels in 2015. We evaluated avoidable mortality and DALY reductions for the years 2015 to 2024 relative to a Base Case scenario in which only endogenous changes occurred. We present results by cause and region, looking at impacts on acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) and four noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). We found that just 2.6% of global DALYs would be averted between 2015 and 2024, compared to 4.5% of global DALYs attributed to HAP in the 2010 GBD study, due in large part to the endogenous tendency towards declining traditional stove usage in the IFs base case forecast. The extent of diminished impact was comparable for ALRI and affected NCDs, though for different reasons. ALRI impacts diminish due to the declining burden of ALRI in the base case forecast, particularly apparent in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Although NCD burdens are rising in regions affected by HAP, the avoidable risk of NCD nonetheless diminishes due to lagged effects. Because the stove transition and the decline of ALRI are proceeding more slowly in Sub-Saharan Africa, avoidable impacts would also be more persistent (3.9% of total DALY due to HAP) compared to South Asia (3.6%) or Southeast Asia (2.5%).--NEW SECTION--Our results illustrate how a temporal dynamic calculation of avoidable risk may yield different estimates, compared to a static attributable risk estimate, of the global and regional burden of disease. Our results suggest a window of rising and falling opportunity for HAP interventions that may have already closed in Southeast Asia and may be closing quickly in South Asia, but may remain open longer in Sub-Saharan Africa. A proper accounting of global health priorities should apply an avoidable risk framework that considers the role of ongoing social, economic and health transitions in constantly altering the disease and risk factor landscape.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The elevation of biological suffering, at the detriment of sociopolitical contextualization, has been shown to clearly impact both acute and long-term care of individuals and communities. With many medical students spending a portion of their educational time in global learning experiences, exposure to humanitarianism and its consequences becomes a unique component of biomedical education. How does the medical field reconcile global health education with the critiques of humanitarianism? This paper argues that the medical response to humanitarian reason should begin at the level of a social history. Using experiential data culled from fieldwork with Palestinian and Syrian refugees in Lebanon, the authors argue that an expanded social history, combined with knowledge derived from the social sciences, can have significant clinical implications. The ability to contextualize an individual's disease and life within a complex sociopolitical framework means that students must draw on disciplines as varied as anthropology, sociology, and political history to further their knowledge base. Moreover, situating these educational goals within the framework of physician advocacy can build a strong base in medical education from both a biomedical and activist perspective.",eng,Anthropology & medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Although the presence of hypovitamin D increases the risk of rickets and fractures, low vitamin D levels are also associated with hypertension, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. In addition, diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are also related to vitamin D levels. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to onset and progression of DM. Although in patients with DM the relationship between vitamin D and insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and β-cell dysfunction are pointed out, evidence regarding vitamin D levels and DM is contradictory, and well controlled studies are needed. In addition, vitamin D influences the renin-angiotensin system, inflammation, and mineral bone disease, which may be associated with the cause and progression CKD. There is increasing evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for DM and CKD; however, it remains uncertain whether vitamin D deficiency also predisposes to death from DM and CKD. Although at this time, supplementation with vitamin D has not been shown to improve glycemic control or prevent incident DM, clinical trials with sufficient sample size, study periods, and optimal doses of vitamin D supplementation are still needed.

26979389,10.1038/srep23237,Mutual antagonism between hepatitis B viral mRNA and host microRNA let-7.,"The interplay between viral and host factors plays a major role in viral pathogenesis. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem that leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although HBV proteins have been studied extensively about their implication in hepatocarcinogenesis, the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis are still largely unknown. A recent concept in gene regulation, in which competitive endogenous RNAs compete for common microRNAs (miRNAs), suggests that mRNA targets are key elements in the regulation of miRNA availability. Here, we show that HBV mRNA in the preS2 region can be targeted by host miRNA let-7 g. This leads to the sequestration of let-7 g and inhibition of let-7 g function. The expression of HBV transcripts, including the preS2 region, de-repressed let-7 g targets, which may contribute to long-term oncogenesis. HBV transcript-expressing transgenic mice, but not non-targeted transcript-expressing mice, were more prone to chemically induced hepatoocarcinogenesis. Let-7 target protein expression was upregulated in human HCC tissues derived from HBV-infected patients. On the other hand, let-7 g inhibited HBV preS2 protein expression and viral products. These results suggest that the interplay between viral intermediate transcripts during HBV replication and host miRNAs is crucial to the pathogenesis of chronic viral infection.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

ARGs from bacteria can be mobilized by mobile genetic elements, and recent studies indicate that phages and phage-derived particles, among others, could play a role in the spread of ARGs through the environment. ARGs are abundant in the bacterial and bacteriophage fractions of water bodies and for successful transfer of the ARGs, their persistence in these environments is crucial. In this study, three ARGs (blaTEM, blaCTX-M and sul1) that naturally occur in the bacterial and phage fractions of raw wastewater were used to evaluate the persistence of ARGs at different temperatures (4 °C, 22 °C and 37 °C) and pH values (3, 7 and 9), as well as after various disinfection treatments (thermal treatment, chlorination and UV) and natural inactivation in a mesocosm. Gene copies (GC) were quantified by qPCR; then the logarithmic reduction and significance of the differences between their numbers were evaluated. The ARGs persisted for a long time with minimal reductions after all the treatments. In general, they showed greater persistence in the bacteriophage fraction than in the bacterial fraction. Comparisons showed that the ARGs persisted under conditions that reduced culturable Escherichia coli and infectious coliphages below the limit of detection. The prevalence of ARGs, particularly in the bacteriophage fraction, poses the threat of the spread of ARGs and their incorporation into a new bacterial background that could lead to the emergence of new resistant clones.",eng,Water research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In this study we measured inhalation parameter values of 25 healthy adult volunteers when using Foster(®) NEXThaler(®) and Seretide(®) Diskus(®). Relationships between emitted doses and patient-specific inhalation flow rates were established. Furthermore, individualized emitted particle size distributions were determined applying size distributions at measured flow rates. Based on the measured breathing parameter values, we calculated patient-specific drug deposition distributions for the active components (steroid and bronchodilator) of both drugs by the help of a validated aerosol lung deposition model adapted to therapeutic aerosols. Deposited dose fractions and deposition densities have been computed in the entire respiratory tract, in distinct anatomical regions of the airways and at the level of airway generations. We found that Foster(®) NEXThaler(®) deposits more efficiently in the lungs (average deposited steroid dose: 42.32±5.76% of the nominal emitted dose) than Seretide(®) Diskus(®) (average deposited steroid dose: 24.33±2.83% of the nominal emitted dose), but the variance of the deposition values of different individuals in the lung is significant. In addition, there are differences in the required minimal flow rates, therefore at certain patients Seretide(®) Diskus(®) or pMDIs could be a better choice. Our results show that validated computer deposition models could be useful tools in providing valuable deposition data and assisting health professionals in the personalized drug selection and delivery optimization. Patient-specific modeling could open a new horizon in the treatment of asthma towards a more effective personalized medicine in the future.",eng,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26975810,10.1016/S2213-2600(15)00543-3,A global view of pulmonary hypertension.,"Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.",eng,The Lancet.

Formal, integrated global health programs within pulmonary and critical care fellowships are relatively new but are built on principles and ideals of global health that focus on the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and social justice. Although core competencies consistent with these overarching themes in global health education have not been formalized for pulmonary and critical care trainees, relevant competency areas include clinical knowledge, international research training, cultural competency, and clinical and research capacity building. Existing global health education in U.S. pulmonary and critical care medicine training programs can generally be classified as one of three different models: integrated global health tracks, global health electives, and additional research years. Successful global health education programs foster partnerships and collaborations with international sites that emphasize bidirectional exchange. This bidirectional exchange includes ongoing, equitable commitments to mutual opportunities for training and professional development, including a focus on the particular knowledge and skill sets critical for addressing the unique priorities of individual countries. However, barriers related to the availability of mentorship, funding, and dedicated time exist to expanding global health education in pulmonary and critical care medicine. The implementation of global health training within pulmonary and critical care medicine programs requires continued optimization, but this training is essential to prepare the next generation of physicians to address the global aspects of respiratory disease and critical illness.",eng,Annals of the American Thoracic Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This intravenous drug is approved in the EU and the USA as combination therapy with oral lenalidomide and intravenous or oral dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. In the multinational, phase III ASPIRE study in this patient population, carfilzomib triple combination therapy significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS), reflecting a clinically relevant gain in PFS of 8.7 months, compared with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone. Improvements in overall response rate and patients' global health status were also observed with carfilzomib triple combination therapy. A significant improvement in overall survival (OS) is yet to be demonstrated, with the prespecified stopping boundary not crossed at the time of the prespecified interim analysis, although OS data were not mature by the cut-off date. Carfilzomib triple combination therapy had a manageable tolerability profile. The incidences of the most frequently reported grade 3 or higher adverse events of special interest (with the exception of neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia) were low in both the carfilzomib triple combination therapy and lenalidomide plus dexamethasone groups. Although final OS data are awaited, current evidence suggests carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is a welcome addition to the treatment options currently available for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.",eng,Targeted oncology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In this work, the combined efficacy of two nanoadjuvant platforms (polyanhydride nanoparticles and pentablock copolymer-based hydrogels) to induce protective immunity against H5N1 influenza virus was examined. Mice received two subcutaneous vaccinations (day 0 and 21) containing 10 μg of H5 hemagglutinin trimer alone or in combination with the nanovaccine platforms. Nanovaccine immunization induced high neutralizing antibody titers that were sustained through 70 days postimmunization. Finally, mice were intranasally challenged with A/H5N1 VNH5N1-PR8CDC-RG virus and monitored for 14 days. Animals receiving the combination nanovaccine had lower viral loads in the lung and weight loss after challenge in comparison to animals vaccinated with each platform alone.

Generic questionnaires lack sensitivity to capture PLD-related symptoms, a prerequisite to determine effectiveness of therapy. We developed and validated a disease-specific questionnaire that assesses symptoms in PLD (PLD-Q). We identified 16 PLD-related symptoms (total score 0-100 points) by literature review and interviews with patients and clinicians. The developed PLD-Q was validated in Dutch (n = 200) and United States (US; n = 203) PLD patients. We assessed the correlation of PLD-Q total score with European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) symptom scale, global health visual analogue scale (VAS) of EQ-5D, and liver volume. To test discriminative validity, we compared PLD-Q total scores of patients with different PLD severity stages (Gigot classification) and PLD-Q total scores of PLD patients with general controls and polycystic kidney disease patients without PLD. Reproducibility was tested by comparing original test scores with 2-week retest scores. In total, 167 Dutch and 124 US patients returned the questionnaire. Correlation between PLD-Q total score and EORTC symptom scale (The Netherlands [NL], r = 0.788; US, r = 0.811) and global health VAS (NL, r = -0.517; US, r = -0.593) was good. There was no correlation of PLD-Q total score with liver volume (NL, r = 0.138; P = 0.236; US, r = 0.254; P = 0.052). Gigot type III individuals scored numerically higher than type II patients (NL, 46 vs. 40; P = 0.089; US, 48 vs. 36; P = 0.055). PLD patients scored higher on the PLD-Q total score than general controls (NL, 42 vs. 17; US, 40 vs. 13 points) and polycystic kidney disease patients without PLD (22 points). Reproducibility of PLD-Q was excellent (NL, r = 0.94; US, 0.96).--NEW SECTION--PLD-Q is a valid, reproducible, and sensitive disease-specific questionnaire that can be used to assess PLD-related symptoms in clinical care and future research.

Many patients with faecal incontinence have coexisting pelvic floor disorders such as urinary incontinence and vaginal symptoms. We utilized a pelvic floor assessment tool to analyse any effect of PTNS on global pelvic floor function.--NEW SECTION--Patients with faecal incontinence attending our institution who had failed to respond sufficiently to biofeedback were offered a course of PTNS. Patients underwent pre- and post-stimulation assessment with a validated electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire - Pelvic Floor (ePAQ-PF) for pelvic floor disorders. Scores were compared to assess the effect of treatment on global pelvic floor function.--NEW SECTION--During the study period pre- and post-stimulation ePAQ-PF data were available for 60 patients (55% of all patients starting PTNS). In this cohort there was a significant improvement in bowel continence, bowel related quality of life, irritable bowel syndrome and bowel evacuation with a large effect size for continence and bowel related quality of life. There was also a significant improvement in non-bowel related symptoms, including urinary pain and stress incontinence, urinary related quality of life and bowel related sexual function. Sixty-five per cent of those who answered the question reported improvement in global health after stimulation.--NEW SECTION--For patients presenting with faecal incontinence, PTNS appears to have a positive effect on bowel related function in approximately two-thirds of patients. However, for treatment responders, improvement appears to relate mainly to improvement in bowel related function rather than a global pelvic floor effect.",eng,Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, the specifics of shifting ART dispensing from pharmacy to non-pharmacy personnel have not been addressed in a systematic review, although this can potentially increase access to ART. We will assess the effects of shifting dispensing and distribution of ART and adherence assessment from pharmacy to non-pharmacy personnel in low and middle-income countries.--NEW SECTION--We will search PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, WHO Global Health Library and relevant grey literature for eligible controlled trials. Two authors will screen the search output, select eligible studies, assess risk of bias and extract data from included studies, resolving discrepancies by discussion and consensus. We will perform meta-analysis using both fixed and random effects models, investigate clinical and statistical heterogeneity, and assess our confidence in the overall evidence using standard Cochrane methods, including GRADE.--NEW SECTION--Only secondary data will be included in this review and ethics approval is not required. We will disseminate the review findings in various scientific fora, including peer-reviewed journals.

26969531,10.1016/j.nbd.2016.03.006,A novel multi-modal platform to image molecular and elemental alterations in ischemic stroke.,"Stroke is a major global health problem, with the prevalence and economic burden predicted to increase due to aging populations in western society. Following stroke, numerous biochemical alterations occur and damage can spread to nearby tissue. This zone of ""at risk"" tissue is termed the peri-infarct zone (PIZ). As the PIZ contains tissue not initially damaged by the stroke, it is considered by many as salvageable tissue. For this reason, much research effort has been undertaken to improve the identification of the PIZ and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms that drive tissue damage in the PIZ in the hope of identify new therapeutic targets. Despite this effort, few therapies have evolved, attributed in part, to an incomplete understanding of the biochemical mechanisms driving tissue damage in the PIZ. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has long been the gold standard to study alterations in gross brain structure, and is frequently used to study the PIZ following stroke. Unfortunately, MRI does not have sufficient spatial resolution to study individual cells within the brain, and reveals little information on the biochemical mechanisms driving tissue damage. MRI results may be complemented with histology or immuno-histochemistry to provide information at the cellular or sub-cellular level, but are limited to studying biochemical markers that can be successfully ""tagged"" with a stain or antigen. However, many important biochemical markers cannot be studied with traditional MRI or histology/histochemical methods. Therefore, we have developed and applied a multi-modal imaging platform to reveal elemental and molecular alterations that could not previously be imaged by other traditional methods. Our imaging platform incorporates a suite of spectroscopic imaging techniques; Fourier transform infrared imaging, Raman spectroscopic imaging, Coherent anti-stoke Raman spectroscopic imaging and X-ray fluorescence imaging. This approach does not preclude the use of traditional imaging techniques, and rather it should be use to complement traditional methods such as MRI or histology and immunohistochemistry, to gain a greater insight into disease mechanisms. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by characterizing biochemical alterations within the PIZ 24h after the induction of photothrombotic stroke in mice. Substantial molecular and elemental alterations were identified in the PIZ 24h after stroke that are consistent with tissue swelling and edema, but not oxidative stress. This reveals important mechanistic information, that could not previously be obtained, which should be considered in future studies aimed at developing therapeutic intervention from this model.",eng,Neurobiology of disease,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Previous principal components analyses confirm that the two scales both assess a mix of mental (CDC-MH) and physical health (CDC-PH). The purpose is to conduct item response theory (IRT) analysis on the CDC-MH and CDC-PH scales separately.--NEW SECTION--2182 patients with self-reported or physician-diagnosed arthritis completed a cross-sectional survey including HDCM and HDSM items. Besides global health, the other 8 items ask the number of days that some statement was true; we chose to recode the data into 8 categories based on observed clustering. The IRT assumptions were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis and the data could be modeled using an unidimensional IRT model. The graded response model was used for IRT analyses and CDC-MH and CDC-PH scales were analyzed separately in flexMIRT.--NEW SECTION--The IRT parameter estimates for the five-item CDC-PH all appeared reasonable. The three-item CDC-MH did not have reasonable parameter estimates.--NEW SECTION--The CDC-PH scale is amenable to IRT analysis but the existing The CDC-MH scale is not.

26969374,10.1002/pon.4119,Avoidant coping and self-efficacy mediate relationships between perceived social constraints and symptoms among long-term breast cancer survivors.,"Many breast cancer survivors feel constrained in discussing their cancer experience with others. Limited evidence suggests that social constraints (e.g., avoidance and criticism) from loved ones may negatively impact breast cancer survivors' global health, but research has yet to examine relationships between social constraints and common physical symptoms. Informed by social cognitive processing theory, this study examined whether perceived social constraints from partners and healthcare providers (HCPs) were associated with fatigue, sleep disturbance, and attentional functioning among long-term breast cancer survivors (N = 1052). In addition, avoidant coping and self-efficacy for symptom management were examined as potential mediators of these relationships.--NEW SECTION--Long-term breast cancer survivors (mean years since diagnosis = 6) completed questionnaires assessing social constraints from partners and HCPs, avoidant coping, self-efficacy for symptom management, and symptoms (i.e., fatigue, sleep disturbance, and attentional functioning). Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the hypothesized relationships among variables in two models: one focused on social constraints from partners and one focused on social constraints from HCPs.--NEW SECTION--Both models demonstrated good fit. Consistent with theory and prior research, greater social constraints from both partners and HCPs were associated with greater symptom burden (i.e., greater fatigue and sleep disturbance, poorer attentional functioning). In addition, all relationships were mediated by avoidant coping and self-efficacy for symptom management.--NEW SECTION--Findings are consistent with social cognitive processing theory and suggest that symptom management interventions may be enhanced by addressing the impact of social constraints from survivors' partners and HCPs on their coping and self-efficacy.

Trehalose 6'6-dimycolate (TDM) activates innate inflammation and likely also stimulates chronic inflammation observed during disease progression. Noninfectious models using purified TDM oil/water emulsions elicit pathologic findings observed in patients with TB. We introduce a new TDM model that promotes inflammatory lung pathologic findings and vascular occlusion and hemorrhage. C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were injected with 10 μg of i.p.

TDM (TDM-IVIP) group was compared with mice injected once with i.v. or i.p. TDM. The responses to TDM-IP, TDM-IV, or TDM-IPIV were consistent between mouse strains. Mice that received TDM-IV and TDM-IPIV had inflammatory pathologic findings with increases in inflammatory and T-cell cytokines, and the TDM-IPIV group had further enhancement of IL-10 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The TDM-IPIV group had increased CD4(+) T cells in lung tissue, significantly increased coagulation, decreased clot formation time, and increased maximum clot firmness. Masson's trichrome staining revealed increased deposition of collagen in the occluded vasculature. TDM-IPIV promotes a hypercoagulopathy state, independent of inflammation.

The control mice were injected with the same amount of saline (500 μL, intraperitoneal). In a subgroup of mice, a high dose of lipopolysaccharide (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) was applied to induce endotoxin-related death.--NEW SECTION--The mi-RNA expression profiles in aortas from lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic mice were determined. The result demonstrated that some micro-RNAs were aberrantly expressed in endotoxic mouse arteries. Among them, the endothelial cell-enriched/endothelial cell-specific miR-126a-3p was significantly down-regulated in endotoxic mouse arteries, septic human vessels, as well as vascular endothelial cells isolated from endotoxic mice or treated with lipopolysaccharide. The down-regulation of miR-126a-3p occurred at transcriptional level via the decreased expression of Krüppel-like factor 2, which could be inhibited by Krüppel-like factor 2 over-expression via adenovirus expressing Krüppel-like factor 2. The down-regulation of miR-126a-3p in endothelial cells resulted in the increased apoptosis, and decreased proliferation and migration, which were inhibited by miR-126a-3p mimics. In vivo, over-expression of miR-126a-3p via lentivirus attenuated endotoxemia-induced injuries on endothelial function and vascular permeability. We found that SPRED1 and VCAM-1 were two direct target genes of miR-126a-3p related to miR-126a-3p-mediated effects in endotoxemia. Finally, the survival rate of endotoxic mice was significantly increased by the over-expression of miR-126a-3p.--NEW SECTION--The results suggest that vascular micro-RNAs such as miR-126a-3p may represent novel mechanisms and new therapeutic targets for endotoxemia-induced vascular injury and endotoxic mortality.",eng,Critical care medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Earlier studies have shown positive correlations between various sexually transmitted infections at different population levels. In this article, we test the hypothesis that there was a residual variation in the national prevalence rates of syphilis and that these rates could predict subsequent peak HIV prevalence rates.--NEW SECTION--This analysis uses linear regression to evaluate the country-level relationship between antenatal syphilis prevalence (1990-1999) and peak HIV prevalence. Antenatal syphilis data were taken from an Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation database on the prevalence of syphilis in low-risk populations. Peak HIV prevalence was calculated based on data taken from the Global Health Observatory Data Repository of the World Health Organization.--NEW SECTION--A moderately strong association is found for the 76 countries with data available (R = 0.53, P < 0.001). The association was weakened but remained significantly positive when we adjusted for the type of syphilis testing used.--NEW SECTION--Syphilis prevalence in the 1990s predicted approximately 53% of the variation in peak HIV prevalence.

Few studies have evaluated costs borne by neurosurgical patients in the developing world and their potential implications for efficient and effective delivery of care in this population. METHODS The families of 40 pediatric neurosurgery patients were surveyed in February 2015 at the AIC Kijabe Hospital in Kijabe, Kenya. Costs associated with obtaining inpatient care were assessed. RESULTS Patient families were charged an average of US $539.44 for neurosurgical services, representing 132% of their annual income. Indirect expenses (transport, food and lodging, lost wages) constituted US $79.37, representing 14.7% of the overall cost and 19.5% of their annual income. CONCLUSIONS Expansion of pediatric neurosurgical services throughout the developing world necessitates increased attention to seemingly insignificant expenses that are absorbed by patients and their families. Even when all direct costs are covered at the institutional or national level, without additional assistance, some patients may be too poor to obtain even ""free"" neurosurgical care.",eng,Journal of neurosurgery.

26963157,10.1080/21655979.2016.1149270,The growing pipeline of natural aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors for malaria treatment.,"Malaria remains a major global health problem. Parasite resistance to existing drugs makes development of new antimalarials an urgency. The protein synthesis machinery is an excellent target for the development of new anti-infectives, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) have been validated as antimalarial drug targets. However, avoiding the emergence of drug resistance and improving selectivity to target aaRS in apicomplexan parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum, remain crucial challenges. Here we discuss such issues using examples of known inhibitors of P. falciparum aaRS, namely halofuginone, cladosporin and borrelidin (inhibitors of ProRS, LysRS and ThrRS, respectively). Encouraging recent results provide useful guidelines to facilitate the development of novel drug candidates which are more potent and selective against these essential enzymes.",eng,Bioengineered,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26962409,10.4239/wjd.v7.i4.50,Management of diabolical diabetes mellitus and periodontitis nexus: Are we doing enough?,"Periodontitis is the commonest oral disease affecting population worldwide. This disease is notorious for the devastation of tooth supporting structures, ensuing in the loss of dentition. The etiology for this disease is bacterial biofilm, which accumulates on the teeth as dental plaque. In addition to the biofilm microorganisms, other factors such as environmental, systemic and genetic are also responsible in progression of periodontitis. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is metabolic disorder which has an impact on the global health. DM plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Periodontitis is declared as the ""sixth"" major complication of DM. Evidence based literature has depicted an enhanced incidence and severity of periodontitis in subjects with DM. A ""two way"" relationship has been purported between periodontitis and DM. Mutual management of both conditions is necessary. Periodontal therapy (PT) may assist to diminish the progression of DM and improve glycemic control. Various advanced technological facilities may be utilized for the purpose of patient education and disease management. The present paper clarifies the etio-pathogenesis of periodontitis, establishing it as a complication of DM and elaborating the various mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis. The role of PT in amelioration of DM and application of digital communication will be discussed. Overall, it is judicious to create an increased patient cognizance of the periodontitis-DM relationship. Conjunctive efforts must be undertaken by the medical and oral health care professionals for the management of periodontitis affected DM patients.",eng,World journal of diabetes,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26962281,10.4103/0973-1075.173958,Unilobar Versus Bilobar Biliary Drainage: Effect on Quality of Life and Bilirubin Level Reduction.,"Percutaneous biliary drainage is an accepted palliative treatment for malignant biliary obstruction.--NEW SECTION--To assess the effect on quality of life (QOL) and bilirubin level reduction in patients with inoperable malignant biliary obstruction treated by unilobar or bilobar percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD).--NEW SECTION--Over a period of 2 years, 49 patients (age range, 22-75 years) of inoperable malignant biliary obstruction were treated by PTBD. Technical and clinical success rates, QOL, patency rates, survival rates, and complications were recorded. Clinical success rates, QOL, and bilirubin reduction were compared in patients treated with complete (n = 21) versus partial (n = 28) liver parenchyma drainage. QOL before and 1 month after biliary drainage were analyzed retrospectively between these two groups.--NEW SECTION--Biliary drainage was successful in all 49 patients, with an overall significant reduction of the postintervention bilirubin levels (P < 0.001) resulting in overall clinical success rate of 89.97%. Clinical success rates were similar in patients treated with whole-liver drainage versus partial-liver drainage. Mean serum bilirubin level before PTBD was 19.85 mg/dl and after the procedure at 1 month was 6.02 mg/dl. The mean baseline functional score was 39.35, symptom scale score was 59.55, and global health score was 27.45. At 1 month, mean functional score was 61.25, symptom scale score was 36.0 4, and global health score was 56.33, with overall significant improvement in QOL (<0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in the improvement of the QOL scores (P = 0.002), among patients who achieved clinical success, compared with those patients who did not achieve clinical success at 1 month. We did not find any significant difference in the QOL scores in patients according to the amount of liver drained (unilateral or bilateral drainage), the type of internalization used (ring biliary or stent). Overall, minor and major complications rates were 14.3% and 8.1%, respectively.--NEW SECTION--Percutaneous biliary drainage provides good palliation of malignant obstructive jaundice. Partial-liver drainage achieved results as good as those after complete liver drainage with significant improvements in QOL and reduction of the bilirubin level.",eng,Indian journal of palliative care,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26962221,10.1128/JVI.03211-15,Antibodies Elicited by Multiple Envelope Glycoprotein Immunogens in Primates Neutralize Primary Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV-1) Sensitized by CD4-Mimetic Compounds.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins (Env) mediate virus entry through a series of complex conformational changes triggered by binding to the receptors CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4. Broadly neutralizing antibodies that recognize conserved Env epitopes are thought to be an important component of a protective immune response. However, to date, HIV-1 Env immunogens that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies have not been identified, creating hurdles for vaccine development. Small-molecule CD4-mimetic compounds engage the CD4-binding pocket on the gp120 exterior Env and induce Env conformations that are highly sensitive to neutralization by antibodies, including antibodies directed against the conserved Env region that interacts with CCR5/CXCR4. Here, we show that CD4-mimetic compounds sensitize primary HIV-1 to neutralization by antibodies that can be elicited in monkeys and humans within 6 months by several Env vaccine candidates, including gp120 monomers. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the gp120 V2 and V3 variable regions were isolated from the immunized monkeys and humans; these monoclonal antibodies neutralized a primary HIV-1 only when the virus was sensitized by a CD4-mimetic compound. Thus, in addition to their direct antiviral effect, CD4-mimetic compounds dramatically enhance the HIV-1-neutralizing activity of antibodies that can be elicited with currently available immunogens. Used as components of microbicides, the CD4-mimetic compounds might increase the protective efficacy of HIV-1 vaccines.--NEW SECTION--Preventing HIV-1 transmission is a high priority for global health. Eliciting antibodies that can neutralize transmitted strains of HIV-1 is difficult, creating problems for the development of an effective vaccine. We found that small-molecule CD4-mimetic compounds sensitize HIV-1 to antibodies that can be elicited in vaccinated humans and monkeys. These results suggest an approach to prevent HIV-1 sexual transmission in which a virus-sensitizing microbicide is combined with a vaccine.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The blood pressure reading is the primary tool for physicians and patients to assess the efficacy of the treatment. The blood pressure lowering effect of beta-1 selective blockers is not known.--NEW SECTION--To quantify the dose-related effects of various doses and types of beta-1 selective adrenergic receptor blockers on systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in people with primary hypertension.--NEW SECTION--We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) for related reviews.We searched the following databases for primary studies: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (All years to 15 October 2015), CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (2015, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 15 October 2015), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 15 October 2015) and ClinicalTrials.gov (all years to 15 October 2015).The Hypertension Group Specialised Register includes controlled trials from searches of CAB Abstracts, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Food Science and Technology Abstracts (FSTA), Global Health, LILACS, MEDLINE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, PsycINFO, Web of Science and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).Electronic databases were searched using a strategy combining the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximizing version (2008 revision) with selected MeSH terms and free text terms. No language restrictions were used. The MEDLINE search strategy was translated into CENTRAL, EMBASE, the Hypertension Group Specialised Register and ClinicalTrials.gov using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable. Full strategies are in Appendix 1.--NEW SECTION--Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials. Studies had to contain a beta blocker monotherapy arm with fixed dose. People enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between 3 weeks to 12 weeks. Drugs in this class of beta blockers are atenolol, betaxolol, bevantolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, metoprolol, nebivolol, pafenolol, practolol.--NEW SECTION--Two authors confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently. Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3.5 was used to synthesise data.--NEW SECTION--We identified 56 RCTs (randomised controlled trials) that examined the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta-1 selective blockers (beta-1 blocker) in 7812 primary hypertensive patients. Among the included trials, 26 RCTs were parallel studies and 30 RCTs were cross-over studies, examining eight beta-1 blockers. Overall, the majority of beta-1 blockers studied significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute. The maximum BP reduction of beta-1 blockers occurred at twice the starting dose. Individual beta-1 blockers did not exhibit a graded dose-response effect on SBP and DBP over the recommended dose range.Most beta-1 blockers tested significantly lowered heart rate. A graded dose-response of beta-1 blockers on heart rate was evident. Higher dose beta-1 blockers lowered heart rate more than lower doses. Individually and overall beta-1 blockers did not affect pulse pressure, which distinguishes them from other classes of drugs.--NEW SECTION--This review provides low quality evidence that in people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute as compared to placebo. The effect of beta-1 blockers at peak hours, -12/-9 mmHg, was greater than the reduction at trough hours, -8/-7 mmHg. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by a greater magnitude than dual receptor beta-blockers and partial agonist beta-blockers, lowered BP similarly to nonselective beta-blockers. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered SBP by a similar degree and lowered DBP by a greater degree than diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Because DBP is lowered by a similar extent to SBP, beta-1 selective blockers do not reduce pulse pressure.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26960569,10.1038/srep22871,Structure of ThiM from Vitamin B1 biosynthetic pathway of Staphylococcus aureus - Insights into a novel pro-drug approach addressing MRSA infections.,"Infections caused by the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are today known to be a substantial threat for global health. Emerging multi-drug resistant bacteria have created a substantial need to identify and discover new drug targets and to develop novel strategies to treat bacterial infections. A promising and so far untapped antibiotic target is the biosynthesis of vitamin B1 (thiamin). Thiamin in its activated form, thiamin pyrophosphate, is an essential co-factor for all organisms. Therefore, thiamin analogous compounds, when introduced into the vitamin B1 biosynthetic pathway and further converted into non-functional co-factors by the bacterium can function as pro-drugs which thus block various co-factor dependent pathways. We characterized one of the key enzymes within the S. aureus vitamin B1 biosynthetic pathway, 5-(hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole kinase (SaThiM; EC 2.7.1.50), a potential target for pro-drug compounds and analyzed the native structure of SaThiM and complexes with the natural substrate 5-(hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole (THZ) and two selected substrate analogues.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Measures included the disease-specific Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-GP), general Patient Reported Outcome Measure Information System (PROMIS) global health and validated measures of anxiety and depression. Bivariate statistics were used to analyze demographic groups and changes in mean scores over time.--NEW SECTION--Of 231 patients completing baseline interviews, 185 (80%) completed 1-month, 170 (74%) 3-month, and 174 (75%) 6-month interviews. Minimally invasive (n=115, 63%) and laparotomy (n=60, 32%) procedures were performed. Functional wellbeing (20 → 17.6, p<0.0001) decreased at 1-month, and recovered by 3 and 6months. Emotional wellbeing increased (16.3 → 20.1, p<0.0001) and anxiety decreased (54.2 → 49.0, p<0.0001) at 1-month, and were stable at 3 and 6months. Physical wellbeing scales were not sensitive to surgery. These patterns were consistent across procedure type, cancer diagnosis, and adjuvant therapy administration. In an exploratory analysis of the interaction of QOL and quality, patients with increased postoperative healthcare resource use were noted to have higher baseline levels of anxiety.--NEW SECTION--For women undergoing gynecologic oncology procedures, temporary declines in functional wellbeing are balanced by improvements in emotional wellbeing and decreased anxiety symptoms after surgery.

26957314,10.1186/s12905-016-0291-9,A qualitative study exploring midlife women's stages of change from domestic violence towards freedom.,"Domestic Violence (DV) remains a significant global health problem for women in contemporary society. Existing literature on midlife women's experiences of domestic violence is limited and focuses on health implications. Leaving a violent relationship is a dynamic process that often requires multiple attempts and separations prior to final termination. The aim of this study was to explore the process of leaving a violent relationship for midlife women.--NEW SECTION--This qualitative study involved fifteen women aged between 40-55 who had accessed residential and non-residential community support services for domestic violence within the UK. Community-based support agencies provided these women with access to letters of invitation and participant information sheet explaining the study. The women notified agency staff who contacted the research team to arrange a mutually convenient time to meet within a safe place for both the women and researchers. It was stressed to all potential participants that no identifiable information would be shared with the agency staff. Women were considered survivors of DV if they defined themselves as such. Data were gathered through semi structured interviews, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed.--NEW SECTION--Midlife women appear to differ from younger women by transitioning quickly though the stages of change, moving rapidly through the breaking free onto the maintenance stage. This rapid transition is the resultant effect of living with long-term violence causing a shift in the women's perception towards the violent partner, with an associated reclamation of power from within the violent relationship. A realisation that rapid departure from the violence may be critical in terms of personal safety, and the realisation that there was something 'wrong' within the relationship, a 'day of dawning' that had not been apparent previously appears to positively affect the trajectory of leaving.--NEW SECTION--Midlife women appeared to navigate through the stages of change in a rapid linear process, forging ahead and exiting the relationship with certainty and without considering options. Whilst these findings appear to differ from younger women's process of leaving, further research is needed to explore and understand the optimum time for intervention and support to maximise midlife women's opportunities to escape an abusive partner, before being reflected appropriately in policy and practice.",eng,BMC women's health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

26954551,10.1002/14651858.CD009926.pub2,Subsidising artemisinin-based combination therapy in the private retail sector.,"Malaria causes ill health and death in Africa. Treating illness promptly with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is likely to cure people and avoid the disease progressing to more severe forms and death. In many countries, ACT use remains low. Part of the problem is that most people seek treatment from the retail sector where ACTs are expensive; this expense is a barrier to their use.The Global Fund and other international organisations are subsidising the cost of ACTs for private retail providers to improve access to ACTs. The subsidy was initially organised through a stand-alone initiative, called the Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm), but has since been integrated into the Global Fund core grant management and financial processes.--NEW SECTION--To assess the effect of programmes that include ACT price subsidies for private retailers on ACT use, availability, price and market share.--NEW SECTION--We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 1, The Cochrane Library, including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register); MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), CINAHL (EbscoHost), EconLit (ProQuest), Global Health (OvidSP), Regional Indexes (Global Health Library, WHO), LILACS (Global Health Library, WHO), Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) and Health Management (ProQuest). All databases were searched February 2015, except for Health Management which was searched November 2013, without any date, language or publication status restrictions. We also searched the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; WHO), ClinicalTrials.gov (NIH) and various grey literature sources. We also conducted a cited reference search for all included studies in ISI Web of Knowledge, checked references of identified articles and contacted authors to identify additional studies.--NEW SECTION--Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted-time-series studies that compared the effects of ACT price subsidies for private retailers to no subsidies or alternative ACT financing mechanisms were eligible for inclusion. Two authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion.--NEW SECTION--Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed study risk of bias and confidence in effect estimates (certainty of evidence) using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).--NEW SECTION--We included four trials (two cluster-randomised trials reported in three articles and two non-randomised cluster trials). Three trials assessed retail sector ACT subsidies combined with supportive interventions (retail outlet provider training, community awareness and mass media campaigns). One trial assessed vouchers provided to households to purchase subsidised ACTs. Price subsidies ranged from 80% to 95%. One trial enrolled children under five years of age; the other three trials studied people of all age groups. The studies were done in rural districts in East Africa (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania).In this East Africa setting, these ACT subsidy programmes increased the percentage of children under five years of age receiving ACTs on the day, or following day, of fever onset by 25 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) 14.1 to 35.9 percentage points; 1 study, high certainty evidence). This suggests that in practice, among febrile children under five years of age with an ACT usage rate of 5% without a subsidy, subsidy programmes would increase usage by between 19% and 41% over a one year period.The ACT subsidy programmes increased the percentage of retail outlets stocking ACTs for children under five years of age by 31.9 percentage points (95% CI 26.3 to 37.5 percentage points; 1 study, high certainty evidence). Effects on ACT stocking for patients of any age is unknown because the certainty of evidence was very low.The ACT subsidy programmes decreased the median cost of ACTs for children under five years of age by US$ 0.84 (median cost per ACT course without subsidy: US$ 1.08 versus with subsidy: US$ 0.24; 1 study, high certainty evidence).The ACT subsidy programmes increased the market share of ACTs for children under five years of age by between 23.6 and 63.0 percentage points (1 study, high certainty evidence).The ACT subsidy programmes decreased the use of older antimalarial drugs (such as amodiaquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine) among children under five years of age by 10.4 percentage points (95% CI 3.9 to 16.9 percentage points; 1 study, high certainty evidence).None of the three studies of ACT subsidies reported the number of patients treated who had confirmed malaria.Vouchers increased the likelihood that an illness is treated with an ACT by 16 to 23 percentage points; however, vouchers were associated with a high rate of over-treatment of malaria (only 56% of patients taking ACTs from the drug shop tested positive for malaria under the 92% subsidy; 1 study, high certainty evidence).--NEW SECTION--Programmes that include substantive subsidies for private sector retailers combined with training of providers and social marketing improved use and availability of ACTs for children under five years of age with suspected malaria in research studies from three countries in East Africa. These programmes also reduced prices of ACTs, improved market share of ACTs and reduced the use of older antimalarial drugs among febrile children under five years of age. The research evaluates drug delivery but does not assess whether the patients had confirmed (parasite-diagnosed) malaria. None of the included studies assessed patient outcomes; it is therefore not known whether the effects seen in the studies would translate to an impact on health.",eng,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

26953795,10.1071/RD15461,Implementing the use of a biobank in the endangered black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes).,"In the current global health climate, many conservation biologists are managing crisis situations, including increased species extinction rates. One strategy for securing wildlife populations into the future is to preserve biomaterials in genome resource banks (GRB; or 'biobanks'). However, for GRBs to be successful we must understand the fundamental reproductive biology of species, along with developing assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs), including AI and semen cryopreservation. ART has been successfully used for several taxa, from amphibians to mammals, including ungulates, carnivores and primates. Not all these success stories implemented the use of a biobank, but one example that discussed herein is the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) GRB. From a founder population of seven individuals, this species has been breeding in a managed setting for nearly 30 years. The goal of the breeding program is to maintain genetic integrity by ensuring each individual has the opportunity to pass his/her genes onto the next generation, while simultaneously providing animals for release into the wild. Scientists have used ART (e.g. AI) in the recovery program. Recently, semen from an individual of the founder population that was cryopreserved for up to 20 years was used successfully for AI, which improved the genetic diversity of the population.

Domains included: (1) sociodemographic data, current personal difficulties, assessment scales for the quality of life and for the global health status of the child (2) French-validated versions of the Perinatal Posttraumatic Stress disorder Questionnaire and of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Associations between PTSD and severity of the neonatal course, presence of severe sequelae at 2 years of age, and quality of life and global health status of children according to their parents' perception were studied.--NEW SECTION--A Tertiary care University Hospital.--NEW SECTION--Among 64 eligible families, 54 parents of 38 children (59%) participated to the study. PTSD was present in 32 (59%) parents; mothers were more frequently affected than fathers (69 vs 46%, p = 0.03). Four mothers (8%) had severe anxiety. PTSD was neither associated with neonatal severity nor with severe sequelae at 2 years. Parents with PTSD rated their child's quality of life and global health status significantly lower (7.5 vs 8.6; p = 0.01 and 7.4 vs 8.3; p = 0.02 respectively).--NEW SECTION--PTSD is frequent in parents of children with esophageal atresia, independently of neonatal severity and presence of severe sequelae at 2 years of age.

The direct target cells of ZIKV in the developing human fetus are not clear. Here we show that a strain of the ZIKV, MR766, serially passaged in monkey and mosquito cells efficiently infects human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Infected hNPCs further release infectious ZIKV particles. Importantly, ZIKV infection increases cell death and dysregulates cell-cycle progression, resulting in attenuated hNPC growth. Global gene expression analysis of infected hNPCs reveals transcriptional dysregulation, notably of cell-cycle-related pathways. Our results identify hNPCs as a direct ZIKV target. In addition, we establish a tractable experimental model system to investigate the impact and mechanism of ZIKV on human brain development and provide a platform to screen therapeutic compounds.",eng,Cell stem cell,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Preventing and treating HIV infection is a crucial task. However, there is still no effective HIV vaccine for clinical application. Nanotechnology has the potential to solve the problems associated with traditional HIV vaccines. At present, various nano-architectures and nanomaterials can function as potential HIV vaccine carriers or adjuvants, including inorganic nanomaterials, liposomes, micelles and polymer nanomaterials. In this review, we summarize the current progress in the use of nanotechnology for the development of an HIV/AIDS vaccine and discuss its potential to greatly improve the solubility, permeability, stability and pharmacokinetics of HIV vaccines. Although nanotechnology holds great promise for applications in HIV/AIDS vaccines, there are still many inadequacies that result in a variety of risks and challenges. The potential hazards to the human body and environment associated with some nano-carriers, and their underlying mechanisms require in-depth study. Non-toxic or low-toxic nanomaterials with adjuvant activity have been identified. However, studying the confluence of factors that affect the adjuvant activity of nanomaterials may be more important for the optimization of the dosage and immunization strategy and investigations into the exact mechanism of action. Moreover, there are no uniform standards for investigations of nanomaterials as potential vaccine adjuvants. These limitations make it harder to analyze and deduce rules from the existing data. Developing vaccine nano-carriers or adjuvants with high benefit-cost ratios is important to ensure their broad usage. Despite some shortcomings, nanomaterials have great potential and application prospects in the fields of AIDS treatment and prevention.",eng,Advanced drug delivery reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The public health risk posed by these two routes is not well understood, particularly in non-pathogenic bacteria. We collected pooled samples from 8 groups of 1741 commercial cattle as they moved through the process of beef production from feedlot entry through slaughter. We recorded antimicrobial drug exposures and interrogated the resistome at points in production when management procedures could potentially influence ARD abundance and/or transmission. Over 300 unique ARDs were identified. Resistome diversity decreased while cattle were in the feedlot, indicating selective pressure. ARDs were not identified in beef products, suggesting that slaughter interventions may reduce the risk of transmission of ARDs to beef consumers. This report highlights the utility and limitations of metagenomics for assessing public health risks regarding antimicrobial resistance, and demonstrates that environmental pathways may represent a greater risk than the food supply.",eng,eLife,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

To build on these data, we extracted additional budget data, and disaggregated development assistance for HIV/AIDS into nine program areas, including prevention, treatment, and health system support.--NEW SECTION--Since 2000, $109.8 billion of development assistance has been provided for HIV/AIDS. Between 2000 and 2010, development assistance for HIV/AIDS increased at an annualized rate of 22.8%. Since 2010, the annualized rate of growth has dropped to 1.3%. Had development assistance for HIV/AIDS continued to climb after 2010 as it had in the previous decade, $44.8 billion more in development assistance would have been available for HIV/AIDS. Since 1990, treatment and prevention were the most funded HIV/AIDS program areas receiving $24.6 billion and $22.7 billion, respectively. Since 2010, these two program areas and HIV/AIDS health system strengthening have continued to grow, marginally, with majority support from the US government and the Global Fund. An average of $252.9 of HIV/AIDS development assistance per HIV/AIDS prevalent case was disbursed between 2011 and 2013.--NEW SECTION--The scale-up of development assistance for HIV/AIDS from 2000 to 2010 was unprecedented.

Information on the epidemiology and outcomes of AKI will help to audit practice and advocate for policies that will reduce this burden. This study determined aetiologies, short term outcomes and their predictors in AKI patients in a tertiary hospital in Southwest Nigeria.--NEW SECTION--This was an 18-month retrospective study that involved 91 patients with AKI. The socio-demographic information, aetiology, severity and the treatment given to patients were recorded. Outcomes and their predictors were determined using multivariate analysis. P value < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant.--NEW SECTION--The mean age of the study population was 45.12 ±20.67 years.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis we aimed to estimate the increase in risk of four adverse fetal outcomes in women who had dengue infection during pregnancy.--NEW SECTION--For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Medline, Embase, Global Health Library, and Scopus for articles published before Aug 1, 2015. We included original studies that reported any fetal outcomes for pregnant women who had dengue infection during the gestational period. Case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies and unselected case series were eligible for inclusion. We excluded case reports, ecological studies, reviews, in-vitro studies, and studies without data for pregnancy outcomes. We independently screened titles and abstracts to select papers for inclusion and scored the quality of those included in meta-analyses. For each study, we recorded study design, year of publication, study location, period of study, and authors and we extracted data for population characteristics such as the number of pregnancies, dengue diagnostic information, and the frequency of outcomes. We investigated four adverse fetal outcomes: stillbirth, miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birthweight. We estimated the increase in risk of these adverse fetal outcomes by use of Mantel-Haenszel methods. We assessed heterogeneity of odds ratios (OR) with the I(2) statistic.--NEW SECTION--We identified 278 non-duplicate records, of which 107 full-text articles were screened for eligibility. 16 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review and eight were eligible for the meta-analyses, which included 6071 pregnant women, 292 of whom were exposed to dengue during pregnancy. For miscarriage, the OR was 3·51 (95% CI 1·15-10·77, I(2)=0·0%, p=0·765) for women with dengue infection during pregnancy compared with those without. We did not do a meta-analysis for stillbirth because this outcome was investigated in only one study with a comparison group; we calculated the crude relative risk to be 6·7 (95% CI 2·1-21·3) in women with symptomatic dengue compared with women without dengue. Preterm birth and low birthweight were the most common adverse pregnancy outcomes. The OR for the association with dengue was 1·71 (95% CI 1·06-2·76, I(2)=56·1%, p=0·058) for preterm birth and 1·41 (95% CI 0·90-2·21, I(2)=0·0%, p=0·543) for low birthweight.--NEW SECTION--Evidence suggests that symptomatic dengue during pregnancy might be associated with fetal adverse outcomes.

The current framework is rooted in an outdated pseudo-evolutionary theory of epidemiologic transition, which weds NCDs to modernity, and relies on global aggregate data. It is oriented around a simplistic causal model of behaviour, risk and disease, which implicitly locates 'risk' within individuals, conveniently drawing attention away from important global drivers of the NCD epidemic. In fact, the epidemiologic realities of the bottom billion reveal a burden of neglected chronic diseases that are associated with 'alternative' environmental and infectious risks that are largely structurally determined. In addition, the vertical orientation of the framework fails to centralise health systems and delivery issues that are essential to chronic disease prevention and treatment. A new framework oriented around a global health equity perspective would be able to correct some of the failures of the current model by bringing the needs of the global poor to the forefront, and centralising health systems and delivery.

Expert knowledge and perceived local realities.,"Compelling evidence for the long-term impact of conditions in gestation and early childhood on both physical and psychosocial functioning and productivity has stimulated a focus in global health policy and social services on the ""first 1000 days"". Consequently, related initiatives may assume that rationale for this orientation and the agency of parents during this period is self-evident and widely shared among parents and communities. In 2012, we tested this assumption among a sample of 38 township-dwelling caregivers in Cape Town, by asking a question identified during a study of cultural models of parenting, namely: At what age or stage can a parent or caregiver have the most influence on a child's development? Formal cultural consensus analysis of responses met criteria for strong agreement that the period for greatest impact of parenting on a child's development occurs at adolescence, at a median age of 12 years. In follow-up focus groups and structured interviews, caregivers articulated clear ecological and developmental reasons for this view, related to protection both of developmental potential and against powerful, context-specific ecological risks (early pregnancy, substance ab/use, violence and gangs) that emerge during adolescence. Such risks threaten educational attainment, reproductive health, and social derailment with enduring consequences for lifetime well-being that caregivers are highly motivated to prevent. Developmental needs in pregnancy and early childhood, by contrast, were considered more manageable. These findings resonate with emerging evidence for multiple sensitive periods with corresponding developmental needs, and urge the value of complementing efforts to optimize early development with those to sustain and enhance it during later windows of developmental opportunity such as adolescence. Our results also indicate the need to consult local views of developmental risk and parenting practice in communicating with caregivers and planning interventions, and the value of using available methodological tools to do so.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

26942455,10.1089/AID.2015.0275,"Perceptibility and the ""Choice Experience"": User Sensory Perceptions and Experiences Inform Vaginal Prevention Product Design.","The development of pericoital (on demand) vaginal HIV prevention technologies remains a global health priority. Clinical trials to date have been challenged by nonadherence, leading to an inability to demonstrate product efficacy. The work here provides new methodology and results to begin to address this limitation. We created validated scales that allow users to characterize sensory perceptions and experiences when using vaginal gel formulations. In this study, we sought to understand the user sensory perceptions and experiences (USPEs) that characterize the preferred product experience for each participant. Two hundred four women evaluated four semisolid vaginal formulations using the USPE scales at four randomly ordered formulation evaluation visits. Women were asked to select their preferred formulation experience for HIV prevention among the four formulations evaluated. The scale scores on the Sex-associated USPE scales (e.g., Initial Penetration and Leakage) for each participant's selected formulation were used in a latent class model analysis. Four classes of preferred formulation experiences were identified. Sociodemographic and sexual history variables did not predict class membership; however, four specific scales were significantly related to class: Initial Penetration, Perceived Wetness, Messiness, and Leakage. The range of preferred user experiences represented by the scale scores creates a potential target range for product development, such that products that elicit scale scores that fall within the preferred range may be more acceptable, or tolerable, to the population under study. It is recommended that similar analyses should be conducted with other semisolid vaginal formulations, and in other cultures, to determine product property and development targets.",eng,AIDS research and human retroviruses,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The Kenyan Ministry of Health (MOH) is committed to reducing cancer mortality, as evidenced by policies such as the National Cancer Control Strategy (2011-2016). There are many Kenyan and international organizations devoted to this task; however, coordination is lacking among stakeholders, resulting in inefficient and overlapping expenditure of resources.--NEW SECTION--The MOH and the NCI Center for Global Health collaboratively executed a two day workshop to improve coordination among government, NGO, and private organizations. Over 80 stakeholders participated from leading cancer research and control institutions in Kenya and the international sphere.--NEW SECTION--Actionable recommendations include: establishment of a nationally representative population-based cancer registry; enhanced training for community health workers, nurses, researchers, pathologists, and oncology specialists; a reconfigured referral process, including leveraging of existing resources to improve access to cancer care; and coordinated community outreach and education. The MOH is in the process of forming a Technical Working Group (TWG) and has elected a Board of Directors for the newly established Kenyan National Cancer Institute (KNCI), with both entities committed to advancing the cancer control work of the MOH.--NEW SECTION--This stakeholder meeting enhanced in-country networks, identified priority needs and developed actionable proposals for coordinated improvement of cancer research and control.

Here, we developed an integrated assay that combines loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for DNA detection of S. Enteritidis using specifically designed Raman active Au-nanoprobes. The target DNA was amplified by LAMP and then labeled with Au-nanoprobes comprised of gold nanoparticle-modified with specific cy5/DNA probes to allow the detection by SERS. The sensitivity of the developed LAMP-SERS detection assay (66 CFU/mL) was ~100-fold higher than the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Significantly, this technique allowed highly specific detection of the target DNA of S. Enteritidis and could differentiate it from the DNA of closely related bacterial species or non-specific contamination, making it more accurate and reliable than the standard LAMP technique. The applicability of detection of S. Enteritidis in milk samples using LAMP-SERS assay was validated as well. In sum, the developed LAMP-SERS assay is highly specific and sensitive, and has the potential to be applied for rapid detection of different foodborne pathogens and other microbial contaminants.",eng,Theranostics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled prevalence (PP), and meta-regression to examine the effect of setting, region and time.--NEW SECTION--Data from 138 studies involving 193 subpopulations and 97,070 girls were extracted. In 88 studies, half of the girls reported being informed prior to menarche (PP 48%, 95% CI 43% to 53%, I(2) 98.6%). Commercial pad use was more common among urban (PP 67%, 57% to 76%, I(2) 99.3%, n=38) than rural girls (PP 32%, 25% to 38%, I(2) 98.6%, n=56, p<0.0001), with use increasing over time (p<0.0001). Inappropriate disposal was common (PP 23%, 16% to 31%, I(2) 99.0%, n=34). Menstruating girls experienced many restrictions, especially for religious activities (PP 0.77, 0.71 to 0.83, I(2) 99.1%, n=67). A quarter (PP 24%, 19% to 30%, I(2) 98.5%, n=64) reported missing school during periods. A lower prevalence of absenteeism was associated with higher commercial pad use in univariate (p=0.023) but not in multivariate analysis when adjusted for region (p=0.232, n=53).

The loss of extracellular matrix protein has been considered to be the most important molecular basis facilitating the development of POP. Oxidative stress (OS) is a well‑recognized mechanism involved in fiber metabolic disorders. The present study aimed to clarify whether OS exists in the uterosacral ligament (USL) with POP, and to investigate the precise role of OS in collagen metabolism in human USL fibroblasts (hUSLFs). In the present study, 8‑hydroxyguanosine (8‑OHdG) and 4 hydroxynonenal (4‑HNE), as oxidative biomarkers, were examined by immunohistochemistry to evaluate oxidative injury in USL sections in POP (n=20) and non‑POP (n=20) groups. The primary cultured hUSLFs were treated with exogenous H2O2 to establish an original OS cell model, in which the expression levels of collagen, type 1, α1 (COL1A1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)‑2 and transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1 were evaluated by western blot and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. The results showed that the expression levels of 8‑OHdG and 4‑HNE in the POP group were significantly higher, compared with those in the control group. Collagen metabolism was regulated by H2O2 exposure in a concentration‑dependent manner, in which lower concentrations of H2O2 (0.1‑0.2 mM) stimulated the anabolism of COL1A1, whereas a higher concentration (0.4 mM) promoted catabolism. The expression levels of MMP‑2, TIMP‑2 and TGF‑β1 exhibited corresponding changes with the OS levels. These results suggested that OS may be involved in the pathophysiology of POP by contributing to collagen metabolic disorder in a severity‑dependent manner in hUSLFs, possibly through the regulation of MMPs, TIMPs and TGF‑β1 indirectly.",eng,Molecular medicine reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Online forums provide a unique insight into the anonymous discussion of suicide, including sociocultural norms about suicide and the delicate management of online interaction. In this article, we examine the provision and acknowledgment of support in an online discussion forum about suicide, using discursive psychology to analyze the textual interaction. The analysis illustrates how forum threads function as case studies and enable members to gain support on numerous occasions. In this way, members can gain help at crisis points as and when these occur, while still maintaining authenticity as a valid forum member. The analysis also provides additional evidence for models of suicide which highlight the fluid nature of suicidality and contributes to the preventative work on suicide by demonstrating how support can be provided at crisis points.",eng,Qualitative health research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A key instrument to close this gap is policy and implementation research (PIR) that aims to produce generalizable evidence on what works to implement successful interventions at scale. Rigorously designed PIR promotes global learning and local accountability. Much greater national and global investments in PIR capacity will be required to enable the scaling of effective approaches and to prevent the recycling of failed ideas.

Relationship between quality of life (QoL) or symptom burden (SYB) and treatment efficacy (tumour response and survival) is poorly described. Therefore, we evaluated the predictive value of pretreatment QoL and SYB on treatment outcomes.--NEW SECTION--Eligible patients had metastatic gastrointestinal cancers and were about to receive 1st/2nd line palliative chemotherapy. 47 patients were consecutively enrolled. QoL and SYB were assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 and MSKCC MSAS questionnaires before treatment and after first response evaluation after 8-12 weeks. Logistic regression analysis of QoL and SYB for prediction of objective treatment efficacy was performed. Patients were categorized according to response rate (RR) based on RECIST1.1 and progression free survival (PFS). PFS was categorized by a ratio (individual PFS/expected PFS) in above median (ratio ≥ 1) or below median PFS (ratio < 1). QoL and SYB were analysed for RR groups (partial response, stable or progressive disease) and PFS ratio (PFSR).--NEW SECTION--Objective response to chemotherapy and increase in PFS were associated with better pretreatment QoL and less SYB. Patients with future objective treatment efficacy (PFSR ≥ 1) evidenced clinically relevant better role/emotional/cognitive/social functioning and less fatigue and appetite loss at baseline in comparison to PFSR < 1 (>10 points difference). Lowest scores in all functioning scales at treatment start were seen in patients with future PFSR < 1. Global health status (EORTC), PSYCH subscale and global distress index (MSAS) predicted PFSR, even if adjusted for gender, age, cancer type, ECOG and line of treatment (p < 0.05). Interestingly, improved QoL and SYB (subjective benefit) were noted even in patients with worse pretreatment status and no objective tumour response.--NEW SECTION--Future non-responders seem to show distinct QoL patterns before chemotherapy. This may facilitate early detection of patients deriving less or even no benefit from treatment regarding prolongation of survival. Even in patients with primarily progressive disease QoL and SYB may improve during treatment. Integration of QoL and SYB assessment into decision-making about palliative chemotherapy seem to be an important approach to improve patient outcome and should be further evaluated.",eng,BMC palliative care,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

26925496,10.1016/j.jaut.2016.02.006,The Zika outbreak of the 21st century.,"The Zika virus outbreak has captivated the attention of the global audience and information has spread rapidly and wildly through the internet and other media channels. This virus was first identified in 1947, when it was isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey placed by British scientists working at the Yellow Fever Research Laboratory located in the Zika forest area of Uganda, hence its name, and is transmitted primarily by the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The fact that the rhesus macaque is an Asian species being placed in an African forest brings to mind the possibility of rapid adaptation of the virus from an African to Asian species, an issue that has not been considered. Whether such adaptation has played any role in acquiring pathogenicity due to cross species transmission remains to be identified. The first human infection was described in Nigeria in 1954, with only scattered reports of about a dozen human infections identified over a 50-year period. It was not until 2007 that Zika virus raised its ugly head with infections noted in three-quarters of the population on the tiny island of Yap located between the Philippines and Papua New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean, followed by a major outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013. The virus remained confined to a narrow equatorial band in Africa and Asia until 2014 when it began to spread eastward, first toward Oceania and then to South America. Since then, millions of infected individuals have been identified in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, including 25 additional countries in the Americas. While the symptoms associated with Zika virus infection are generally mild, consisting of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis, there have been reports of more severe reactions that are associated with neurological complications. In pregnant women, fetal neurological complications include brain damage and microcephaly, while in adults there have been several cases of virus-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome. The virus was until recently believed to only be transmitted via mosquitoes. But when the Zika virus was isolated from the semen specimens from a patient in Texas, this provided the basis for the recent report of possible sexual transmission of the Zika virus. Due to the neurological complications, various vectors for infection as well as the rapid spread throughout the globe, it has prompted the World Health Organization to issue a global health emergency. Various governmental organizations have recommended that pregnant women do not travel to countries where the virus is epidemic, and within the countries affected by the virus, recommendations were provided for women of childbearing age to delay pregnancy. The overall public health impact of these above findings highlights the need for a rapid but specific diagnostic test for blood banks worldwide to identify those infected and for the counseling of women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy. As of this date, there are neither commercially licensed diagnostic tests nor a vaccine. Because cross-reactivity of the Zika virus with dengue and Chikungunya virus is common, it may pose difficulty in being able to quickly develop such tests and vaccines. So far the most effective public health measures include controlling the mosquito populations via insecticides and preventing humans from direct exposure to mosquitoes.",eng,Journal of autoimmunity,Historical Article,2025-04-23,2016

With the extremely high cost of manufactured phantoms, homemade alternatives are popular substitutes. Gelatine is commonly used as a matrix to suspend analogues and mimic tissue, but other substrates like ground meat can also be used. Both of these substrates require refrigeration and are subject to spoiling. Our research was designed to evaluate whether agar models would be superior to traditional Gelatine models in their sustainability and whether they would produce ultrasound images adequate for training.--NEW SECTION--Agar models of varying formulas (percent agar by weight with certain additives varied) were tested for acceptable fidelity to real tissue, ultrasound image quality, and durability compared to gelatine models and human tissue.--NEW SECTION--A five percent by-mass agar model augmented with small amounts of suspended wheat flour presented as a model that could generate an ultrasound image that remarkably resembled that of real tissue. This agar model does not require refrigeration, is resistant to spoiling and desiccation, mimics tissue texture well, is durable enough to withstand high-volume training, and can be recycled to make new models.--NEW SECTION--Agar phantoms are easy to make, do not require refrigeration, and have multiple distinct advantages over gelatine models for ultrasound training in austere conditions.",eng,African journal of emergency medicine : Revue africaine de la medecine d'urgence,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Exposure to microcystins is a global health problem because of its association with various other pathological effects and people all over the world are exposed to microcystins on a regular basis. Evidence shows that microcystin-LR (MC-LR) may adversely affect the immune system, but its specific effects on immune functions are lacking. In the present review, immunotoxicological effects associated with MC-LR in animals, humans, and in vitro models have been reported. Overall, the data shows that chronic exposure to MC-LR has the potential to impair vital immune responses which could lead to increased risk of various diseases including cancers. Studies in animal and in vitro models have provided some pivotal understanding into the potential mechanisms of MC-LR related immunotoxicity suggesting that further investigation, particularly in humans, is required to better understand the relationship between development of disease and the MC-LR exposure.",eng,Journal of toxicology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The kidney has limited regenerative capacity from chronic insults, and for the most common causes of CKD, no effective treatment exists to prevent progression to end-stage kidney failure. Therefore, novel interventions, such as regenerative cell-based therapies, need to be developed for CKD. Given the risk of allosensitization, autologous transplantation of cells to boost regenerative potential is preferred. Therefore, verification of cell function and vitality in CKD patients is imperative. Two cell types have been most commonly applied in regenerative medicine. Endothelial progenitor cells contribute to neovasculogenesis primarily through paracrine angiogenic activity and partly by differentiation into mature endothelial cells in situ. Mesenchymal stem cells also exert paracrine effects, including proangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic activity. However, in CKD, multiple factors may contribute to reduced cell function, including older age, coexisting cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic inflammatory states, and uremia, which may limit the effectiveness of an autologous cell-based therapy approach. This Review highlights current knowledge on stem and progenitor cell function and vitality, aspects of the uremic milieu that may serve as a barrier to therapy, and novel methods to improve stem cell function for potential transplantation.",eng,Kidney international,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

One major challenge is the provision and accessibility of adequate infrastructure. This paper offers ethnographic insight on the conceptual and material conditions that are currently shaping the delivery of oncology in Mumbai, focusing specifically on the way India's socio-economic context necessitates non-biomedical acts of voluntarism or 'seva' (selfless service). Developing the premise that hospitals are not identical clones of a biomedical model, detailed attention is paid to the way 'care' emerges through 'praxis of place' (Casey, 2003) within the cancer hospital as a multi-scalar 'heterotopic' (Street and Coleman, 2012) site. Such a perspective enables global/local tensions to come into view, together with the heterogeneous confluence of juxtaposing materialities, imaginations, social practices and values that both propels and constrains the everyday delivery of care. The paper reflects on the theoretical implications of hospital seva in Mumbai in light of social science studies of hospital ethnography and health activism and contributes important ethnographic insight into the current global health debates regarding effective implementation of cancer services in India.",eng,Health & place,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In this study, we used the combined DNA- and protein-based vaccines of immunodominant antigen Rv0577 to boost BCG and evaluated their immunogenicity in BALB/c mice. Our data suggest that the booster vaccine may substantially enhance the immunogenicity of BCG and strengthen both CD4+ T cell-mediated Th1 and CD8+ T cell-mediated cytolytic responses. Compared with the protein-based vaccine, the DNA-based vaccine can induce more durable Th1 immune response, characterized by high levels of antibody response, proliferation response, percentages of CD4+/CD8+ and cytokine secretion in antigen-stimulated splenocyte cultures. In conclusion, we for the first time, developed a protein- and plasmid DNA-based booster vaccine based on Rv0577.

Little is known about the extent of HIV-HCV co-infection. We sought to characterise the epidemiology and burden of HCV co-infection in people living with HIV.--NEW SECTION--In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL+, POPLINE, Africa-wide Information, Global Health, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library and WHO databases for studies measuring prevalence of HCV and HIV, published between Jan 1, 2002, and Jan 28, 2015. We included studies in HIV population samples of more than 50 individuals and recruited patients based on HIV infection status or other behavioural characteristics. We excluded editorials or reviews containing no primary data, samples of HCV or HIV-HCV co-infected individuals, or samples relying on self-reported infection status. We also excluded samples drawn from populations with other comorbidities or undergoing interventions that put them at increased risk of co-infection. Populations were categorised according to HIV exposure, with the regional burden of co-infection being derived by applying co-infection prevalence estimates to published numbers of HIV-infected individuals. We did a meta-analysis to estimate the odds of HCV in HIV-infected individuals compared with their HIV-negative counterparts.--NEW SECTION--From 31 767 citations identified, 783 studies met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 902 estimates of the prevalence of HIV-HCV co-infection. In HIV-infected individuals, HIV-HCV co-infection was 2·4% (IQR 0·8-5·8) within general population samples, 4·0% (1·2-8·4) within pregnant or heterosexually exposed samples, 6·4% (3·2-10·0) in men who have sex with men (MSM), and 82·4% (55·2-88·5) in people who inject drugs (PWID). Odds of HCV infection were six times higher in people living with HIV (5·8, 95% CI 4·5-7·4) than their HIV-negative counterparts. Worldwide, there are approximately 2 278 400 HIV-HCV co-infections (IQR 1 271 300-4 417 000) of which 1 362 700 (847 700-1 381 800) are in PWID, equalling an overall co-infection prevalence in HIV-infected individuals of 6·2% (3·4-11·9).--NEW SECTION--We noted a consistently higher HCV prevalence in HIV-infected individuals than HIV-negative individuals  across all risk groups and regions, but especially in PWID. This study highlights the importance of routine HCV testing in all HIV-infected individuals, but especially in PWID.

Tracing the source of the contaminant is a vital step towards mitigation and disease prevention. Total 16S rRNA amplicon data for a specific environment (faeces, water, soil) and computational tools such as the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo based SourceTracker can be applied to microbial source tracking (MST) and attribution studies. The current study applied artificial and in-laboratory derived bacterial communities to define the potential and limitations associated with the use of SourceTracker, prior to its application for faecal source tracking at three recreational beaches near Port Phillip Bay (Victoria, Australia). The results demonstrated that at minimum multiple model runs of the SourceTracker modelling tool (i.e. technical replicates) were required to identify potential false positive predictions. The calculation of relative standard deviations (RSDs) for each attributed source improved overall predictive confidence in the results. In general, default parameter settings provided high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision. Application of SourceTracker to recreational beach samples identified treated effluent as major source of human-derived faecal contamination, present in 69% of samples. Site-specific sources, such as raw sewage, stormwater and bacterial populations associated with the Yarra River estuary were also identified. Rainfall and associated sand resuspension at each location correlated with observed human faecal indicators. The results of the optimised SourceTracker analysis suggests that local sources of contamination have the greatest effect on recreational coastal water quality.",eng,Water research,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2016

The literature has yet to comprehensively explore the nature of MST practice, including the use of evidence-based clinical guidelines. This integrative review presents an analysis of guidelines employed in MSTs in Latin America.--NEW SECTION--MEDLINE and LILACs were searched using the terms 'medical brigades', 'Latin America', 'primary health care' and related terms. The search was limited to articles published between 2000 and 2015 in any language. Qualitative or quantitative articles were subsequently included if they described management protocols in the context of patient care on an MST occurring in Latin America. Additional publications were identified by searching the citations of articles reviewed in full. Themes were extracted to an Excel file, and objective instruments were used to evaluate article quality (Mixed Methods Assessment Tool) and the quality of guidelines (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II).--NEW SECTION--Of 391 abstracts screened, eight met inclusion criteria. All described MSTs operating in rural settings in Central America. Five were qualitative descriptive, including two travel reports, an ethics thesis paper, and a description of a dermatologic MST. Four described subjective clinician experiences while describing non-evidence-based treatment suggestions or practices. Only one described evidence-supported primary care interventions. Three studies were quantitative descriptive, including two epidemiological articles, one of which used case definitions for select diagnoses. One described the application of American Family Physician guidelines to the description of UTI prevalence on a MST. Article scores in MMAT quality domains were variable, and only one article achieved a positive overall AGREE II score for guideline quality.--NEW SECTION--Existing literature demonstrates minimal development or use of clinical guidelines on MSTs in Latin America.

Methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius strains are emerging, resembling the global health threat of S. aureus. Therefore, it is increasingly important to characterize potential targets for intervention against S. pseudintermedius. Here, FhuD, an S. pseudintermedius surface lipoprotein implicated in iron uptake, was characterized. It was found that FhuD bound ferrichrome in an iron-dependent manner, which increased the thermostability of FhuD by >15 °C. The crystal structure of ferrichrome-free FhuD was determined via molecular replacement at 1.6 Å resolution. FhuD exhibits the class III solute-binding protein (SBP) fold, with a ligand-binding cavity between the N- and C-terminal lobes, which is here occupied by a PEG molecule. The two lobes of FhuD were oriented in a closed conformation. These results provide the first detailed structural characterization of FhuD, a potential therapeutic target of S. pseudintermedius.",eng,"Acta crystallographica.

Major advances in characterizing viral replication have led to the development of direct-acting anti-viral therapies that have considerably improved patient treatment outcome and can even cure chronic infection. However, the high cost of these treatments, their low barrier to viral resistance, and their inability to prevent HCV-induced liver cancer, along with the absence of an effective HCV vaccine, all underscore the need for continued efforts to understand the biology of this virus. Moreover, beyond informing therapies, enhanced knowledge of HCV biology is itself extremely valuable for understanding the biology of related viruses, such as dengue virus, which is becoming a growing global health concern. Major advances have been realized over the last few years in HCV biology and pathogenesis, such as the discovery of the envelope glycoprotein E2 core structure, the generation of the first mouse model with inheritable susceptibility to HCV, and the characterization of virus-host interactions that regulate viral replication or innate immunity.

To combat this problem, new antibiotics are urgently needed and some plant-associated bacteria are a promising source. The rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica A153 produces several bioactive secondary metabolites, including the anti-oomycete and antifungal haterumalide, oocydin A and the broad spectrum polyamine antibiotic, zeamine. In this study, we show that A153 produces a second broad spectrum antibiotic, andrimid. Using genome sequencing, comparative genomics and mutagenesis, we defined new genes involved in andrimid (adm) biosynthesis. Both the expression of the adm gene cluster and regulation of andrimid synthesis were investigated. The biosynthetic cluster is operonic and its expression is modulated by various environmental cues, including temperature and carbon source. Analysis of the genome context of the adm operon revealed a gene encoding a predicted LysR-type regulator, AdmX, apparently unique to Serratia strains. Mutagenesis and gene expression assays demonstrated that AdmX is a transcriptional activator of the adm gene cluster. At the post-transcriptional level, the expression of the adm cluster is positively regulated by the RNA chaperone, Hfq, in an RpoS-independent manner.

The nuclear body protein, Sp110, has been linked to TB resistance and previous work showed that it enhances macrophage apoptosis upon Mtb infection. Here, we report on the role of Sp110 in transcriptional regulation of macrophage responses to Mtb through integrated transcriptome and mechanistic studies. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Sp110 regulates genes involved in immune responses, apoptosis, defence responses, and inflammatory responses. Detailed investigation revealed that, in addition to apoptosis-related genes, Sp110 regulates cytokines, chemokines and genes that regulate intracellular survival of Mtb. Moreover, Sp110 regulates miRNA expression in macrophages, with immune and apoptosis-related miRNAs such as miR-125a, miR-146a, miR-155, miR-21a and miR-99b under Sp110 regulation. Additionally, our results showed that Sp110 upregulates BCL2 modifying factor (Bmf) by inhibiting miR-125a, and forced expression of Bmf induces macrophage apoptosis. These findings not only reveal the transcriptional basis of Sp110-mediated macrophage resistance to Mtb, but also suggest potential regulatory roles for Sp110 related to inflammatory responses, miRNA profiles, and the intracellular growth of Mtb.",eng,Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In 2011, the GFATM transitioned to a new funding model (NFM), which prioritizes grants to high burden, lower income countries. This shift raises concerns that some low endemic countries, dependent on GFATM financing to achieve their malaria elimination goals, would receive less funding under the NFM. This study aims to understand the projected increase or decrease in national and regional funding from the GFATM's NFM to the 34 malaria-eliminating countries.--NEW SECTION--Average annual disbursements under the old funding model were compared to average annual national allocations for all eligible 34 malaria-eliminating countries for the period of 2014-2017. Regional grant funding to countries that are due to receive additional support was then included in the comparison and analysed. Estimated funding ranges for the countries under the NFM were calculated using the proposed national allocation plus the possible adjustments and additional funding. Finally, the minimum and maximum funding estimates were compared to average annual disbursements under the old funding model.--NEW SECTION--A cumulative 31 % decrease in national financing from the GFATM is expected for the countries included in this analysis. Regional grants augment funding for almost half of the eliminating countries, and increase the cumulative percent change in GTFAM funding to 32 %, though proposed activities may not be funded directly through national malaria programmes. However, if countries receive the maximum possible funding, 46 % of the countries included in this analysis would receive less than they received under the previous funding model.--NEW SECTION--Many malaria-eliminating countries have projected national declines in funding from the GFATM under the NFM. While regional grants enhance funding for eliminating countries, they may not be able to fill country-level funding gaps for local commodities and implementation. If the GFATM is able to nuance its allocation methodology to mitigate drastic funding declines for malaria investments in low transmission countries, the GFATM can ensure previous investments are not lost. By aligning with WHO's Global Technical Strategy for Malaria and investing in both high- and low-endemic countries, the Global Fund can tip the scale on a global health threat and contribute toward the goal of eventual malaria eradication.",eng,Malaria journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We investigated the prevalence of drug-resistance in a total of 80 psychrotrophic strains from bulk milk belonging to Pseudomonas genus (n. 63) and Enterobacteriaceae group (n. 17). All the strains were tested against 16 antibiotics. Pseudomonas were further investigated for their sensitivity against 12 additional antibiotics. Pseudomonas showed a high susceptibility toward fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and piperacillin and, to a lesser extent, to imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime. Thirty-five out of 63 Pseudomonas strains were susceptible to meropenem, while among antibiotics for which recommended breakpoints are not yet available, 55% of Pseudomonas strains had no inhibition halo in presence of nitrofurantoin, highlighting a resistance toward this drug. The results obtained in this study indicate a high efficiency of fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol (94%), and kanamycin (76%) for Enterobacteriaceae while a high prevalence of resistant strains was found to ampicillin (13/17). Serratia marcescens is highly susceptible to fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin. Moreover, mupirocin seems to be the new antibiotic with the less efficacy for Enterobacteriaceae, with 41% of strains without halo, pointing out an important resistance. Further knowledge on resistance to known and new antibiotics among Pseudomonas species and Enterobacteriaceae of milk origin was acquired.",eng,Journal of food science,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Some drivers are prone to repeated episodes of risky driving (RD) and are over-represented in crashes and related morbidity. However, their characteristics are heterogeneous, hampering development of targeted intervention strategies. This study hypothesized that distinct personality, cognitive, and neurobiological processes are associated with the type of RD behaviours these drivers predominantly engage in.--NEW SECTION--Four age-matched groups of adult (19-39 years) males were recruited: 1) driving while impaired recidivists (DWI, n = 36); 2) non-alcohol reckless drivers (SPEED, n = 28); 3) drivers with a mixed RD profile (MIXED, n = 27); and 4) low-risk control drivers (CTL, n = 47). Their sociodemographic, criminal history, driving behaviour (by questionnaire and simulation performance), personality (Big Five traits, impulsivity, reward sensitivity), cognitive (disinhibition, decision making, behavioural risk taking), and neurobiological (cortisol stress response) characteristics were gathered and contrasted.--NEW SECTION--Compared to controls, group SPEED showed greater sensation seeking, disinhibition, disadvantageous decision making, and risk taking. Group MIXED exhibited more substance misuse, and antisocial, sensation seeking and reward sensitive personality features. Group DWI showed greater disinhibition and more severe alcohol misuse, and compared to the other RD groups, the lowest level of risk taking when sober. All RD groups exhibited less cortisol increase in response to stress compared to controls.--NEW SECTION--Each RD group exhibited a distinct personality and cognitive profile, which was consistent with stimulation seeking in group SPEED, fearlessness in group MIXED, and poor behavioural regulation associated with alcohol in group DWI. As these group differences were uniformly accompanied by blunted cortisol stress responses, they may reflect the disparate behavioural consequences of dysregulation of the stress system. In sum, RD preference appears to be a useful marker for clarifying explanatory pathways to risky driving, and for research into developing more personalized prevention efforts.",eng,PloS one,Clinical Trial,2025-04-23,2016

Here, we evaluate the categorical dengue forecasts across all microregions in Brazil, using dengue cases reported in June 2014 to validate the model. We also compare the forecast model framework to a null model, based on seasonal averages of previously observed dengue incidence. When considering the ability of the two models to predict high dengue risk across Brazil, the forecast model produced more hits and fewer missed events than the null model, with a hit rate of 57% for the forecast model compared to 33% for the null model. This early warning model framework may be useful to public health services, not only ahead of mass gatherings, but also before the peak dengue season each year, to control potentially explosive dengue epidemics.",eng,eLife,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2016

26905934,10.1016/j.drugpo.2016.01.002,"Towards ""evidence-making intervention"" approaches in the social science of implementation science: The making of methadone in East Africa.","In this commentary, we take the recent introduction of methadone treatment in response to emerging problems of HIV linked to heroin addiction in Kenya as a case for reflecting on the social science of implementation science. We offer a framework of 'evidence-making intervention' which we hold as distinct from mainstream 'evidence-based intervention' approaches. Whilst accepting that interventions are shaped in their contexts, evidence-based intervention approaches tend to imagine a stable intervention object with universal effect potential. By contrast, an evidence-making intervention approach investigates how an intervention, and the knowledge which constitutes it, is made locally, through its processes of implementation. Drawing on qualitative research generated in Kenya prior to (2012-2013) and during (2014-2015) the implementation of methadone treatment, we explore the making of 'methadone promise' as a case of evidence-making intervention. We show how enactments of methadone promise make multiple methadones, through which a binary is negotiated between the narratives of methadone as hope for addiction recovery and methadone as hope for HIV prevention. Addiction recovery narratives predominate, despite methadone's incorporation into policy via its globally supported HIV prevention evidence-base. Key practices in the making of methadone promise in Kenya include its medicalization, and renaming, as 'medically assisted treatment' - or simply 'MAT' - which distance it from prior constitutions elsewhere as a drug of substitution, and the visualisation of its effects wherein unhealthy people can be seen and shown to have become well. We also show how actors seek to protect the story of methadone promise from counter narratives, including through mass media projects. We conclude that there is no single biomedical object of methadone intervening on a single biological body across contexts, and no single universe of evidence. By giving weight to local rather than outside expert knowledge, and by tracing how the meaning of intervention is made locally through its implementation, we can make visible the multiple enactments of an intervention and how these shape local ecologies of care, including in ways beyond those foreseen by an intervention's evidencing elsewhere.",eng,The International journal on drug policy,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, this is only the start; anaesthesia remains a forgotten speciality within the world of public and global health and there are still challenges in escalating surgery in low and middle-income countries to an acceptable level that is affordable and timely.--NEW SECTION--Although there is increased world interest in safe surgery and anaesthesia this has not yet been translated into a mandate that will compel countries to invest in improving levels of infrastructure, accessibility, manpower, and safety.

This Series paper considers the potential effects of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use during this period on: social, psychological, and health outcomes in adolescence and young adulthood; role transitions, and later health and social outcomes of regular substance use initiated in adolescence; and the offspring of young people who use substances. We sourced consistent support for causal relations between substance use and outcomes and evidence of biological plausibility from different but complementary research designs. Many adverse health and social outcomes have been associated with different types of substance use. The major challenge lies in deciding which are causal. Furthermore, qualitatively different harms are associated with different substances, differences in life stage when these harms occur, and the quality of evidence for different substances and health outcomes varies substantially. The preponderance of evidence comes from a few high-income countries, thus whether the same social and health outcomes would occur in other countries and cultures is unclear. Nonetheless, the number of harms that are causally related to substance use in young people warrant high-quality research design interventions to prevent or ameliorate these harms.",eng,The lancet.

Adolescence is the peak time for initiation of substance use, with tobacco and alcohol usually preceding the use of illicit drugs. Substantial variation is noted between countries in the levels, types, and sequences of substance use in young people, indicating that a young person's use of substances depends on their social context, drug availability, and their personal characteristics. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study suggests that the burden attributable to substance use increases substantially in adolescence and young adulthood. In young men aged 20-24 years, alcohol and illicit substance use are responsible for 14% of total health burden. Alcohol causes most health burden in eastern Europe, and illicit drug burden is higher in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and western Europe. Large gaps exist in epidemiological data about the extent of drug use worldwide and much of what we know about the natural history of substance use comes from cohort studies in high-income countries undertaken decades ago, which hinders effective global policy responses. In view of the global epidemiological transitions from diseases of poverty to non-communicable diseases, the burden of disease and health risks among adolescents and young adults is likely to change substantially, in ways that will no doubt see substance use playing an increasingly large part.",eng,The lancet.

We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of HRQOL on long-term survival outcomes in disease-free cervical cancer survivors (CCSs).--NEW SECTION--The study sample consisted of 860 disease-free CCSs from 6 Korean cancer hospitals recruited for HRQOL survey during 2005 (median time from diagnosis, 5.9 years). Health-related quality-of-life measures included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and its Cervical Cancer Module (CX24).

Age, time since diagnosis, and physical activity were independent prognostic factors, which constituted the baseline model along with cancer stage. When HRQOL domains were tested separately against the baseline model, functional scales (physical, role, social, and emotional functioning), global health status, symptom scales (pain and appetite loss), and cervical cancer module items (body image, sexual inactivity, and sexual worry) were significantly associated with survival (P < 0.05).--NEW SECTION--These findings suggest that, in addition to well-known prognostic factors, including age, time since diagnosis, and physical activity, HRQOL scores obtained from disease-free CCSs are associated with survival.",eng,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The intervention was comprised of three components-Mobile Voluntary Counseling and Testing (MVCT), Community Mobilization (CM) and Post-Test Support Services (PTSS). QAC procedures were based on standardized criteria, and were designed to assess both provider skills and adherence to the intervention protocol. Supervisors observed a random sample of 5% to 10% of sessions each month and evaluated staff against multiple criteria on scales of 1-5. A score of 5 indicated 100% adherence, 4 indicated 95% adherence, and 3 indicated 90% adherence. Scores below 3 were considered unsatisfactory, and protocol deviations were discussed with the respective staff.--NEW SECTION--During the first year of the intervention, the mean scores of MVCT and CM staff across the 5 study sites were 4 (95% adherence) or greater and continued to improve over time. Mean QAC scores for the PTSS component were lower and displayed greater fluctuations. Challenges to PTSS staff were identified as coping with the wide range of activities in the PTSS component and the novelty of the PTSS process. QAC fluctuations for PTSS were also associated with new staff hires or changes in staff responsibilities. Through constant staff monitoring and support, by Year 2, QAC scores for PTSS activities had reached those of MVCT and CM.--NEW SECTION--The implementation of a large-sale, evidence based HIV intervention requires extensive QAC to ensure implementation effectiveness. Ongoing appraisal of study staff across sites ensures consistent and high quality delivery of all intervention components, in keeping with the goals of the study protocol, while also providing a forum for corrective feedback, additional supervision and retraining of staff. QAC ensures staff fidelity to study procedures and is critical to the successful delivery of multi-site HIV prevention interventions, as well as the delivery of services scaled up in programmatic situations.",eng,PloS one,"Clinical Trial, Phase III",2025-04-23,2016

The ongoing Ebola virus (EBOV) disease epidemic in Western Africa claimed more than 11,300 lives and was associated with secondary cases outside Africa, demonstrating that filoviruses pose a global health threat. Bats constitute an important natural reservoir of filoviruses, including viruses of the recently identified Cuevavirus genus within the Filoviridae family. However, the interactions of filoviruses with bat cells are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether filoviruses employ different strategies to enter human and bat cells. For this, we examined host cell entry driven by glycoproteins (GP) from all filovirus species into cell lines of human and fruit bat origin. We show that all GPs were able to mediate entry into human and most fruit bat cell lines with roughly comparable efficiency. In contrast, the efficiency of entry into the cell line EidNi/41 derived from a straw-colored fruit bat varied markedly between the GPs of different filovirus species. Furthermore, inhibition studies demonstrated that filoviruses employ the same host cell factors for entry into human, non-human primate and fruit bat cell lines, including cysteine proteases, two pore channels and NPC1 (Niemann-Pick C1 molecule). Finally, processing of GP by furin and the presence of the mucin-like domain in GP were dispensable for entry into both human and bat cell lines. Collectively, these results show that filoviruses rely on the same host cell factors for entry into human and fruit bat cells, although the efficiency of the usage of these factors might differ between filovirus species.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Current EV-A71 vaccine clinical trials have demonstrated that human antibody responses generated by EV-A71 vaccinations do not cross-neutralize coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). An effective multivalent HFMD vaccine is urgently needed. From molecular epidemiological studies in Southeast Asia, CV-A6 and CV-A10 are commonly found in HFMD outbreaks. In this study, CV-A6 and CV-A10 were individually cultured in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells grown in medium containing serum, harvested and concentrated. In viral downstream purification, two viral fractions were separated by sucrose gradient zonal ultracentrifugation and detected using a SDS-PAGE analysis and a virus infectivity assay. These two viral fractions were formalin-inactivated, and only the infectious particle fraction was found to be capable of inducing CV-A serotype-specific neutralizing antibody responses in animal immunogenicity studies. These mouse and rabbit antisera also failed to cross-neutralize EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections. Only a combination of formalin-inactivated EV-A71, CV-A6, CV-A10 and CV-A16 multivalent vaccine candidates elicited cross-neutralizing antibody responses in both mouse and rabbit immunogenicity studies.

Various screening and confirmatory serological tests have evolved in the past few decades for detection of hepatitis B. However, oral fluid as an alternative to blood could provide substantial advantages. The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of oral fluid in detecting hepatitis B surface antigen using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).--NEW SECTION--Salivary and blood samples were collected from 40 seropositive and 40 seronegative patients of hepatitis B viral infection and were subjected to ELISA test for hepatitis B surface antigen. Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the statistical significance and Kappa (K) statistic was used to assess the degree of agreement between serum and oral fluid samples. The p-value <0.05 was considered as significant value.--NEW SECTION--A sensitivity and specificity of 100% of oral fluid assay was obtained for the diagnosis of hepatitis B infection. The degree of agreement between saliva and serum for detection of hepatitis B was found to be perfect (Kappa value =1).--NEW SECTION--Oral fluid testing can be an interesting, alternative for hepatitis B infection for diagnosis and screening for epidemiological purposes. Further research necessitates for the implementation of saliva as a diagnostic tool.",eng,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Five NTDs (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminths and trachoma) are to be controlled by preventive chemotherapy (PCT), and four (Chagas' disease, human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy and visceral leishmaniasis) by innovative and intensified disease management (IDM). Guinea worm, virtually eradicated, is not considered here. We aim to estimate the global health impact of meeting these targets in terms of averted morbidity, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs).--NEW SECTION--The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study provides prevalence and burden estimates for all nine NTDs in 1990 and 2010, by country, age and sex, which were taken as the basis for our calculations. Estimates for other years were obtained by interpolating between 1990 (or the start-year of large-scale control efforts) and 2010, and further extrapolating until 2030, such that the 2020 targets were met. The NTD disease manifestations considered in the GBD study were analyzed as either reversible or irreversible. Health impacts were assessed by comparing the results of achieving the targets with the counterfactual, construed as the health burden had the 1990 (or 2010 if higher) situation continued unabated.--NEW SECTION--Our calculations show that meeting the targets will lead to about 600 million averted DALYs in the period 2011-2030, nearly equally distributed between PCT and IDM-NTDs, with the health gain amongst PCT-NTDs mostly (96%) due to averted disability and amongst IDM-NTDs largely (95%) from averted mortality. These health gains include about 150 million averted irreversible disease manifestations (e.g. blindness) and 5 million averted deaths. Control of soil-transmitted helminths accounts for one third of all averted DALYs. We conclude that the projected health impact of the London Declaration justifies the required efforts.",eng,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2016

It is a major cause of hospital-acquired infection; a large number of those exposed develop infection. Those infected in hospital are at increased risk of a severe clinical course. Prevention of nosocomial spread currently focuses on spread by hand and large droplets. There is little research evidence to determine if aerosol spread of infectious RSV is possible.--NEW SECTION--To determine if the air surrounding infants with RSV-positive bronchiolitis contains RSV in aerosolized particles that remain capable of causing infection.--NEW SECTION--The amount of RSV contained in aerosolized particles produced by infants with bronchiolitis due to RSV was measured using viable impactor sampling. The ability of RSV contained in these particles to infect healthy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) human ciliated respiratory epithelium was determined.--NEW SECTION--We showed for the first time that infants with RSV-positive bronchiolitis nursed in a ward setting or ventilated in intensive care produced large numbers of aerosol particles containing RSV that remained infectious and were capable of infecting healthy and COPD human ciliated epithelium. A significant amount of RSV was found in particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 5 μm.--NEW SECTION--Many of the aerosolized particles that contained RSV in the air surrounding infants with bronchiolitis were sufficiently small to remain airborne for a significant length of time and small enough to be inhaled and deposited throughout the respiratory tract. It is likely that this leads to spread of infection to others, with dissemination of infection throughout the respiratory tract.",eng,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Despite this global health crisis, few drugs are available to efficiently treat Ebola infections. Drug repurposing provides a potentially efficient solution to accelerating the development of therapeutic approaches in response to Ebola outbreak. To identify such candidates, we use an integrated structural systems pharmacology pipeline which combines proteome-scale ligand binding site comparison, protein-ligand docking, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation.--NEW SECTION--One thousand seven hundred and sixty-six FDA-approved drugs and 259 experimental drugs were screened to identify those with the potential to inhibit the replication and virulence of Ebola, and to determine the binding modes with their respective targets. Initial screening has identified a number of promising hits. Notably, Indinavir; an HIV protease inhibitor, may be effective in reducing the virulence of Ebola. Additionally, an antifungal (Sinefungin) and several anti-viral drugs (e.g. Maraviroc, Abacavir, Telbivudine, and Cidofovir) may inhibit Ebola RNA-directed RNA polymerase through targeting the MTase domain.--NEW SECTION--Identification of safe drug candidates is a crucial first step toward the determination of timely and effective therapeutic approaches to address and mitigate the impact of the Ebola global crisis and future outbreaks of pathogenic diseases.

As the number of such programs and participants increase, so too do the absolute health and safety risks. It is clear from a number of published reports that many institutions provide little or no meaningful preparedness for students and do little to ensure their health and safety. These deficiencies together can affect students, their foreign hosts, and sponsoring institutions. The School of Public Health at the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center, and its predecessor, the Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, have sponsored a 6-8 week global health elective for fourth year medical students since 1980. The purposes of this elective are to provide students with an opportunity to observe the health care and public health systems in resource-poor countries, provide medical service, and have a cross-cultural experience. Over the course of the past 35 years, 386 students have participated in this global health elective in more than 41 resource-poor countries. Recent annual applications for this elective have been as high as 44 out of a class of 200 students. Over the past 10 years, annual acceptance rates have varied, ranging from a low of 32 % in 2007-2008 to a high of 74 % in 2010-2011 and 2013-2014. Careful screening, including a written application, review of academic records and personal interviews, has resulted in the selection of highly mature, adaptable, and dedicated students who have performed well at overseas sites. Appropriately preparing students for an overseas global health experience in resource-poor countries requires the investment of much professional and staff time and effort. At the SUNY Downstate School of Public Health, these resources have underpinned our Global Health in Developing Countries elective for many years. As a result, the elective is characterized by meticulous organization, extensive preparedness measures for students, and continuous monitoring of site and country safety. The health of students is ensured by one-on-one assessment of immunization needs, anti-malarials, and the provision of a five-day supply of post-exposure HIV prophylaxis. Students sign agreements regarding the legal issues, immunizations, and anti-malarials recommended as well as HIV post-exposure prophylaxis. They are also required to obtain medical evacuation insurance provided by the university, and medical care insurance valid overseas. Student travel plans are also approved as is in-country lodging. The focus of our 6-8 week global health elective is not clinical medicine. Rather, it is to enable students to learn about the health care and public health systems in a resource-poor country. Through that focus, they also come to understand the causes of health and health care disparities that exist in the country to which they are assigned. Our students are greatly advantaged with regard to cross-cultural understanding since our school is located in New York City's Borough of Brooklyn, where 40 % of the population was born outside of the U.S. Our comprehensive effort at risk management for this global health elective includes a thorough debriefing for each student upon his/her return. Special attention is given to ascertaining illness or injury while overseas, and, when necessary, immediate referral is made to an appropriate university clinical department where a student can be appropriately case managed. Meticulous oversight, careful selection of safe overseas sites, and attention to preparing students have resulted in significant risk reduction and successful experiences for the majority of our 386 students.

We examine the neti pot as a case study for understanding how a foreign health practice became mainstreamed, and what that process reveals about more general discourses of health in the United States. Using discourse analysis of U.S. popular press and new media news (1999-2012) about the neti pot, we trace the development of discourses from neti's first introduction in mainstream news, through the hype following Dr. Oz's presentation on Oprah, to 2011 when two adults tragically died after using Naegleria fowleri amoeba-infested tap water in their neti pots. Neti pot discourses are an important site for communicative analysis because of the pot's complexity as an intercultural artifact: Neti pots and their use are enfolded into the biomedical practice of nasal irrigation and simultaneously Orientalized as exotic/magical and suspect/dangerous. This dual positioning as normal and exotic creates inequitable access for using the neti pot as a resource for increasing cultural health capital (CHC). This article contributes to work that critically theorizes the transnationalism of CIM, as the neti pot became successfully Americanized.

In this study, we investigated the anti-obesity effect of the dried branches and leaves of murta (Myrceugenia euosma Legrand, Myrtaceae). A methanol extract of the dried branches and leaves of murta inhibited adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Three known flavanones-cryptostrobin (1), pinocembrin (4), and 5,7-dihydroxy-6,8-dimethylflavanone (6), and three chalcones-2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxychalcone (2), pinostrobin chalcone (3), and 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-3',5'-dimethylchalcone (5) were isolated from the active fraction. Structures of these compounds were identified using various spectral data. Each of these compounds also inhibited adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. In particular, compound 3 was a more potent inhibitor of triglyceride accumulation than the positive control berberine. Gene expression studies revealed that treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with 3 lowers the expression levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α and peroxisome proliferator activator γ2 during adipogenesis without affecting cell viability. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with 3 reduced the expression levels of mRNAs encoding sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and several lipogenic enzymes, including fatty acid synthase and stearoyl CoA desaturase-1.

However, there is limited systematic, large-scale empirical guidance to inform policy design. Our study operationalized indicators for six dimensions of quality of care that are captured in currently available, standardized Service Provision Assessments. We implemented these measures to assess the levels and heterogeneity of antenatal care in Kenya. Using our indicator mix, we find that performance is low overall and that there is substantial variation across provinces, management authority and facility type. Overall, facilities performed highest in the dimensions of efficiency and acceptability/patient-centeredness, and lowest on effectiveness and accessibility. Public facilities generally performed worse or similarly to private or faith-based facilities. We illustrate how these data and methods can provide readily-available, low-cost decision support for policy.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

CVD is characterized by a cluster of disorders, associated with complex interactions between multiple risk factors. The early identification of high cardiovascular risk subjects is one of the main targets of primary prevention in order to reduce the adverse impact of modifiable factors, from lifestyle changes to pharmacological treatments. The cardioprotective effect of food antioxidants is well known. Indeed, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables results in an increase in serum antioxidant capacity and a decrease in oxidative stress. In contrast, studies on antioxidant supplementation, even those that are numerically significant, have revealed no clear benefit in prevention and therapy of CVD. Both short- and long-term clinical trials have failed to consistently support cardioprotective effects of supplemental antioxidant intake. The aim of this review is to evaluate the antioxidant effects on the main cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes.",eng,"Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Many molecular diagnostic assays are developed based on using thermal cyclers to carry out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcription PCR for DNA and RNA amplification and detection, respectively. Unfortunately, most commercial thermal cyclers are expensive and need continuous electrical power supply, so they are not suitable for uses in low-resource settings. We have previously reported a low-cost and simple approach to amplify DNA using vacuum insulated stainless steel thermoses food cans, which we have named it thermos thermal cycler or TTC. Here, we describe the use of an improved set up to enable the detection of viral RNA targets by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), thus expanding the TTC's ability to identify highly infectious, RNA virus-based diseases in low resource settings. The TTC was successful in demonstrating high-speed and sensitive detection of DNA or RNA targets of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever. Our innovative TTC costs less than $200 to build and has a capacity of at least eight tubes. In terms of speed, the TTC's performance exceeded that of commercial thermal cyclers tested. When coupled with low-cost endpoint detection technologies such as nucleic acid lateral-flow assay or a cell-phone-based fluorescence detector, the TTC will increase the availability of on-site molecular diagnostics in low-resource settings.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Ante-mortem diagnostic tests are inconclusive, and rabies is nontreatable once the clinical signs appear. A large number of host factors are responsible for the altered neuronal functions observed in rabies; however their precise role remains uninvestigated. We therefore used two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis to identify differentially expressed host proteins in an experimental murine model of rabies. We identified 143 proteins corresponding to 45 differentially expressed spots (p < 0.05) in neuronal tissues of Swiss albino mice in response to infection with neurovirulent rabies strains. Time series analyses revealed that a majority of the alterations occur at 4 to 6 days post infection, in particular affecting the host's cytoskeletal architecture. Extensive pathway analysis and protein interaction studies using the bioinformatic tools such as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and STRING revealed novel pathways and molecules (e.g., protein ubiquitination) unexplored hitherto.

This paper presents a systematic assessment of research investments awarded to UK institutions and global health metrics assessing disease burden.--NEW SECTION--We systematically sourced research funding data awarded from public and philanthropic organisations between 1997 and 2013. We screened awards for relevance to infection and categorised data by type of science, disease area and specific pathogen. Investments were compared with mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years lived with disability (YLD) across three time points.--NEW SECTION--Between 1997-2013, there were 7398 awards with a total investment of £3.7 billion. An increase in research funding across 2011-2013 was observed for most disease areas, with notable exceptions being sexually transmitted infections and sepsis research where funding decreased. Most funding remains for pre-clinical research (£2.2 billion, 59.4%). Relative to global mortality, DALYs and YLDs, acute hepatitis C, leishmaniasis and African trypanosomiasis received comparatively high levels of funding. Pneumonia, shigellosis, pertussis, cholera and syphilis were poorly funded across all health metrics. Tuberculosis (TB) consistently attracts relatively less funding than HIV and malaria.--NEW SECTION--Most infections have received increases in research investment, alongside decreases in global burden of disease in 2013. The UK demonstrates research strengths in some neglected tropical diseases such as African trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis, but syphilis, cholera, shigellosis and pneumonia remain poorly funded relative to their global burden. Acute hepatitis C appears well funded but the figures do not adequately take into account projected future chronic burdens for this condition.

Data collected during 2009-2013 were analysed to estimate the proportion of children exposed to SHS in the home. GATS estimates and 2012 United Nations population projections for 2015 were also used to estimate the number of children exposed to SHS in the home.--NEW SECTION--The proportion of children younger than 15 years of age exposed to SHS in the home ranged from 4.5% (Panama) to 79.0% (Indonesia). Of the approximately one billion children younger than 15 years of age living in the 21 countries under study, an estimated 507.74 million were exposed to SHS in the home.

Model structure is typically subject to intense scrutiny, such as confrontation with empirical data and alternative formulations, while a less frequently challenged aspect is the widely adopted reduction of parameters to their average values. Focusing on endemic diseases, we use a general transmission model to explain how mean field approximations decrease the estimated R0 from prevalence data, while threshold phenomena - such as the epidemic and reinfection thresholds - remain invariant. This results in an underestimation of the effort required to control disease, which may be particularly severe when the approximation inappropriately places transmission estimates below important thresholds.

Treatment has changed little in 20 years, and there are no imminent new anticryptococcal agents. The use of adjuvant glucocorticoids reduces mortality among patients with other forms of meningitis in some populations, but their use is untested in patients with cryptococcal meningitis.--NEW SECTION--In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited adult patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Laos, Uganda, and Malawi. All the patients received either dexamethasone or placebo for 6 weeks, along with combination antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and fluconazole.--NEW SECTION--The trial was stopped for safety reasons after the enrollment of 451 patients. Mortality was 47% in the dexamethasone group and 41% in the placebo group by 10 weeks (hazard ratio in the dexamethasone group, 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.47; P=0.45) and 57% and 49%, respectively, by 6 months (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.53; P=0.20).

The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify surgical cost-effectiveness studies that utilized a formulation of the QALY or DALY as a summary measure, (2) report on global patterns of QALY and DALY use in surgery and the income characteristics of the countries and/or regions involved, and (3) assess for possible associations between national/regional-income levels and the relative prominence of either measure.--NEW SECTION--PRISMA-guided systematic review of surgical cost-effectiveness studies indexed in PubMed or EMBASE prior to December 15, 2014, that used the DALY and/or QALY as a summary measure.

Data for 69.0% (569/825) were reported using QALYs (2.1% low-, 1.2% lower-middle-, 4.4% upper-middle-, and 92.3% high-income countries), compared to 31.0% (256/825) reported using DALYs (46.9% low-, 31.6% lower-middle-, 16.8% upper-middle-, and 4.7% high-income countries) (p<0.001). Studies from the US and the UK dominated the total number of QALY studies (49.9%) and were themselves almost exclusively QALY-based. DALY use, in contrast, was the most common in Africa and Asia. While prominent published use of QALYs (1990s) in surgical cost-effectiveness studies began approximately 10 years earlier than DALYs (2000s), the use of both measures continues to increase.--NEW SECTION--As global prioritization of surgical interventions gains prominence, it will be important to consider the comparative implications of summary measure use. The results of this study demonstrate significant income- and geographic-based differences in the preferential utilization of the QALY and DALY for surgical cost-effectiveness studies.

To evaluate the influence of peripheral rotations in a resource-limited setting, the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College introduced a 12-week clerkship rotation in peripheral hospitals for third-year medical (MD3) students in 2012. We administered an end-of-rotation survey to assess student perceptions, and attitudes toward rural practice after graduation.--NEW SECTION--Questionnaires were voluntarily and anonymously administered to MD3 students in April 2014. The questions assessed perceptions of the experience, and attitudes towards rural practice upon graduation. The perceptions were assessed using strength of consensus measures (sCns). The effect of the experience on likelihood for rural practice was assessed using Crude Odds Ratio (COR), and predictors using Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95 % Confidence Intervals (CI) tested at a 5 % level of significance. Variation was assessed using Hosmer and Lemeshow test Chi-square.--NEW SECTION--111 out of 148 MD3 students participated; 62 % were male; 62 % <25 years old; and 72 % matriculated directly from secondary school. Overall, 81 % of MD3 students were satisfied with rural rotations (sCns = 83 %). The likelihood of accepting rural practice deployment after graduation was predicted by satisfaction with the peripheral hospital rotation program (AOR, 4.32; 95 % CI, 1.44-12.96; p, 0.009) and being male (AOR, 2.73; 95 % CI, 1.09-6.84; p, 0.032). Students admitted in medical school after health-related practice trended toward a higher likelihood of accepting rural practice after graduation compared to those enrolled directly from secondary school, although the difference was not significant (AOR, 4.99; 95 % CI, 0.88-28.41; p, 0.070). The Hosmer and Lemeshow test p-value was 0.686, indicating a good fit of the model. No significant differences in satisfaction between these two groups were observed, and also no significant differences between students born in rural areas compared to those born in urban areas existed.--NEW SECTION--Results indicate that satisfaction with rural rotations is associated with increased likelihood of rural practice after graduation.

Many of these deaths result from vaccine-preventable diseases, since obstacles such as cost and accessibility have hampered efforts to deliver efficacious vaccines to those most in need. Additionally, many vaccines given to mothers and children under age five are not suitable for newborns, since their maturing immune systems do not respond optimally during the first few months of life. Maternal immunization-the process by which a pregnant woman's immune system is fortified against a particular disease and the protection is then transferred to her unborn child-has emerged as a strategy to prevent many unnecessary maternal and newborn deaths.

As the initiative nears completion after more than twenty-five years, it becomes critical to document and transition the knowledge, lessons learned, assets, and infrastructure accumulated by the initiative to address other health goals and priorities. The primary goals of this process, known as polio legacy transition planning, are both to protect a polio-free world and to ensure that investments in polio eradication will contribute to other health goals after polio is completely eradicated. The initiative is engaged in an extensive transition process of consultations and planning at the global, regional, and country levels.

This article reports the progress made toward country ownership in twenty-two lower- and lower-middle-income countries engaged in the Sabin Vaccine Institute's Sustainable Immunization Financing Program. We focus on new practices developed in the key public institutions concerned with immunization financing, budget and resource tracking, and legislation, using case studies as examples. Our analysis found that many countries are undertaking new funding mechanisms to reach financing goals. However, budget transparency remains a problem, as only eleven of the twenty-two countries have performed sequential analyses of their immunization program budgets. Promisingly, six countries (Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, Nepal, Nigeria, Senegal, and Uganda) are creating new national immunization funding sources that are backed by legislation. Seven countries already have laws regarding immunization, and new immunization legislative projects are under way in thirteen others.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We created an economic model to estimate the distribution of the economic surplus-the sum of all health and economic benefits of a vaccine, minus the costs of development, production, and distribution-among different country income groups and manufacturers for a cohort of twelve-year-old females in 2012. We found that manufacturers may have received economic returns worth five times their original investment in HPV vaccine development. High-income countries gained the greatest economic surplus of any income category, realizing over five times more economic value per vaccinated female than low-income countries did. Subsidizing vaccine prices in low- and middle-income countries could both reduce financial barriers to vaccine adoption and still allow high-income countries to retain their economic surpluses and manufacturers to retain their profits.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Critics of current analyses of the value of vaccination argue that a broader view is required, one that includes the additional economic benefits of vaccines or acknowledges the social and ethical aims advanced by vaccination programs. Much of this work has paid inadequate attention to the need to apply any expanded view of value consistently across medical interventions, to the close and complex integration of vaccination efforts with other health initiatives, and to the fact that subjectivity and judgments are present in quantitative and qualitative evidence alike. To fully realize the value of vaccination, far more attention, investment, and research are required to better understand the deliberations and decision-making processes by which any kind of evidence is translated into policy.",eng,Health affairs (Project Hope),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We derived these estimates by using costs of vaccines, supply chains, and service delivery and their associated economic benefits. Based on the costs of illnesses averted, we estimated that projected immunizations will yield a net return about 16 times greater than costs over the decade (uncertainty range: 10-25). Using a full-income approach, which quantifies the value that people place on living longer and healthier lives, we found that net returns amounted to 44 times the costs (uncertainty range: 27-67).

Patients undergoing HSCT, aged >14 years with informed consent were recruited (n = 79). Patients in the intervention group (IG) received standard care plus the SCION-HSCT intervention to counteract three problems after HSCT: muscle weakness, oral mucositis and malnutrition. Control group patients received standard care. Primary endpoint was global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at discharge (EORTC QLQ C30 v. 3.0). Baseline characteristics were balanced between both groups, except physical performance (ECOG) being significantly lower for patients of the IG. At discharge, no group differences could be seen regarding HRQoL. Non-confirmatory post hoc analyses showed for patients of the IG a shorter duration of hospitalisation (MD -10.90; 95% CI -18.05 to -3.75) and increased activity during hospitalisation (MD 2.44; 95% CI 1.27-3.61). In conclusion, clinical effectiveness of the intervention could not be proven with respect to the aspired improvement of HRQoL. However, the nurse-led interdisciplinary caring programme could be carried out in every day ward routine. Further research should focus on working mechanisms of complex interventions aiming to improve HRQoL of patients undergoing HSCT.",eng,European journal of cancer care,Controlled Clinical Trial,2025-04-23,2017

In response, tobacco control advocates, with technical support from international health groups, helped strengthen tobacco advertising regulations by prohibiting advertising at the point-of-sale (POS) and banning corporate social responsibility campaigns. The Health Ministry used increased tobacco taxes earmarked for tobacco control to help effectively promote and enforce the law, resulting in high compliance for smoke-free environments, advertising restrictions and health warning label (HWL) regulations. Despite this success, government trade concerns allowed, as of December 2015, POS tobacco advertising, and delayed the release of HWL regulations for 15 months.--NEW SECTION--The implementation phase continues to be a site of intensive tobacco industry political activity in low and middle-income countries.

This study aimed to compare the impact of two rehabilitation programmes on pain, disease activity, locomotor function, global health and work ability forecast in RA patients.--NEW SECTION--Sixty-four employed women aged 24-65 years participated in the study. All patients underwent individual and instrumental kinesiotherapy. Thirty-two patients underwent cryogenic chamber therapy and local cryotherapy as well as non-weight-bearing, instrumental and individual kinesiotherapy. The remaining 32 patients received traditional rehabilitation in the form of electromagnetic and instrumental therapy, individual and pool-based non-weight-bearing kinesiotherapy. Rehabilitation lasted 3 weeks. Patients were examined three times: prior to rehabilitation, after 3 weeks of therapy and 3 months after completion of rehabilitation. The following study instruments were used: to assess disease activity: DAS-28; functional impairment: HAQ-DI; pain severity: VAS; patients' overall well-being: a scale from 0 to 100 (Global Health Index); and patients' own prognosis of fitness for work: the 6th question from Work Ability Index (WAI). Statistical analysis of data was performed using the STATISTICA 8.0 package. Mixed-design two-way analysis of variance was used for hypothesis testing.--NEW SECTION--All patients improved after rehabilitation. The group of patients those who underwent cryotherapy had improved DAS-28, HAQ-DI, VAS and global health scores immediately following the 3-week rehabilitation programme (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.007 and p < 0.001, respectively), as well as at the 3-month follow-up (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.009 and p < 0.001, respectively). Rehabilitation using cryotherapy resulted in greater improvement in disease activity DAS-28 [F(2,105) = 5.700; p = 0.007; η(2) = 0.084] and HAQ-DI locomotor function scores [F(2,109) = 6.771; p = 0.003; η(2) = 0.098] compared to traditional rehabilitation. The impact of both forms of rehabilitation on patients' own prognosis of work ability in the next 2 years was not significant. Results of patients who underwent traditional approach showed decreased disease activity following the initial 3-week period; however, this improvement did not sustain to the end of follow-up, 3 months later.--NEW SECTION--Complex rehabilitation in RA has a positive effect on patients' clinical condition. The rehabilitation programme that includes cryotherapy overtops traditional rehabilitation, particularly as regards improvement in locomotor function, disease activity and sustaining willingness to continue working and exerts long-lasting effect.--NEW SECTION--Rehabilitation using cryotherapy is more effective in improving locomotor function, decreasing disease activity and sustaining willingness to continue working compared to traditional rehabilitation. Rehabilitation using cryotherapy significantly reduces the intensity of pain experienced by patients with RA, and this positive effect is maintained at 3 months post-rehabilitation. Complex rehabilitation, particularly treatment using cryotherapy, improves patients' subjective assessment of their overall well-being and perception of their disease.

Using published data, we estimate the disease burden for mental illness to show that the global burden of mental illness accounts for 32·4% of years lived with disability (YLDs) and 13·0% of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), instead of the earlier estimates suggesting 21·2% of YLDs and 7·1% of DALYs. Currently used approaches underestimate the burden of mental illness by more than a third. Our estimates place mental illness a distant first in global burden of disease in terms of YLDs, and level with cardiovascular and circulatory diseases in terms of DALYs.

The application of NP is ultimately to assist consumers to make healthier food choices, and thus provide a cost effective public health strategy to reduce the incidence of diet-related chronic disease. To our knowledge, no review has assessed the evidence to confirm the validity of NP models. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the construct and criterion-related validity of NP models in ranking food according to their nutritional composition for the purpose of preventing disease and promoting health. We searched peer-reviewed research published to 30 June 2015 and used PUBMED, Global Health (CABI), and SCOPUS databases.

The GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to guide our judgement of the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome measure. From a total of 83 studies, 69 confirmed the construct validity of NP models; however most of these studies contained methodological weaknesses. Six studies used objective external measures to confirm the criterion-related validity of NP models; which inherently improved quality. The overall quality of evidence on the accuracy of NP models was judged to be very low to moderate using the GRADE approach.

Hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death. Two-thirds of births occur at home. A pilot program conducted from 2005 to 2007 demonstrated the effectiveness of using community health workers for advance distribution of misoprostol to pregnant women for self-administration immediately following birth to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. The Ministry of Public Health requested an expansion of the pilot to study implementation on a larger scale before adopting the intervention as national policy. The purpose of this before-and-after study was to determine the effectiveness of advance distribution of misoprostol for self-administration across 20 districts in Afghanistan and identify any adverse events that occurred during expansion.--NEW SECTION--Cross-sectional household surveys were conducted pre- (n = 408) and postintervention (n = 408) to assess the effect of the program on uterotonic use among women who had recently given birth. Maternal death audits and verbal autopsies were conducted to investigate peripartum maternal deaths that occurred during implementation in the 20 districts.--NEW SECTION--Uterotonic use among women in the sample increased from 50.3% preintervention to 74.3% postintervention. Because of a large-scale investment in Afghanistan in training and deployment of community midwives, it was assumed that all women who gave birth in facilities received a uterotonic. A significant difference in uterotonic use at home births was observed among women who lived farthest from a health facility (> 90 minutes self-reported travel time) compared to women who lived closer (88.5% vs 38.9%; P < .0001). All women who accepted misoprostol and gave birth at home used the drug.

Task analysis is particularly useful in assessment and definition of the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that define the scope of practice of a health profession or occupation. Jhpiego, a US-based nongovernmental organization, has adapted traditional task analysis methods in several countries in assessment of workforce education and practice issues. Four case studies are presented to describe the utility and adaptability of the task analysis approach. Traditional task analysis field survey methods were used in assessment of the general and maternal-child health nursing workforce in Mozambique that led to curriculum redesign, reducing the number of education pathways from 4 to 2. The process of health system strengthening in Liberia, following a long history of civil war conflict, included a traditional task analysis study conducted among 119 registered nurses and 46 certified midwives who had graduated in the last 6 months to 2 years to determine gaps in education and preparation. An innovative approach for data collection that involves ""playing cards"" to document participant opinions (Task Master, Mining for Data) was developed by Jhpiego for application in other countries. Results of a task analysis involving 54 nurses and 100 nurse-midwives conducted in Lesotho were used to verify the newly drafted scope and standards of practice for nurses and to inform planning for a competency-based preservice curriculum for nursing. The Nursing and Midwifery Council developed a 100-question licensing examination for new graduates following a task analysis in Botswana.

Identifying the timing of fetal growth faltering is critical for developing preventive interventions. We aim to describe patterns of fetal growth and to predict SGA at birth using fetal ultrasound measurements.--NEW SECTION--We studied 1412 pregnant women enrolled in a randomised-controlled trial evaluating maternal micronutrient supplementation in Thai Nguyen province, Vietnam. Ultrasound examinations included biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC) and abdominal circumference (AC), and femur length (FL). Measures were assessed using the new international fetal growth standards (INTERGROWTH-21st Project). Generalised linear mixed logit regression models were used to examine the association between ultrasound measures and SGA at birth.--NEW SECTION--Overall fetal growth restriction began in early pregnancy and continued through delivery, but the timing of growth faltering varied by measure: it began by 20 weeks for HC, BPD and AC, earlier as compared to FL growth that started >30 weeks. SGA infants had significantly lower mean fetal growth parameters as early as 14 weeks. Ultrasound measures below the 10th percentile were associated with a two to four times higher risk of SGA at birth compared to fetuses greater than the 50th percentile, with the largest odds ratios for AC (OR 3.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7, 5.7).--NEW SECTION--Fetal growth faltering by ultrasound begins in early gestation among rural Vietnamese populations; these patterns clearly identified those to be born SGA.

South Africa, a middle income country, has unacceptably high mortality in children less than 5 years of age. Many factors that contribute to the child mortality rate are time sensitive and require efficient access to emergency care. Delays and barriers within the emergency medical services (EMS) system increase paediatric morbidity and mortality from time sensitive illnesses.--NEW SECTION--This study is a qualitative evaluation of the prehospital care system for paediatric patients in Cape Town, South Africa. A purposive sample of healthcare personnel within and interacting with the EMS system were interviewed. A structured interview form was used to gather data. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed; two independent reviewers performed blinded content analysis of the transcribed script.--NEW SECTION--33 structured interviews were conducted over a 4 week period. Eight broad themes were identified during coding, including: access, communication, community education, equipment, infrastructure, staffing, training and triage. Subcategories were used to identify areas for targeted intervention. Overall agreement between the two independent coders was 93.36%, with a κ coefficient of 0.69.--NEW SECTION--The prehospital system is central to delivering time sensitive care for paediatric patients.

To develop fresh insights and new approaches to TB care and prevention, it is important to incorporate diverse perspectives from outside the strictly biomedical model. In the articles presented in this issue of the Journal of Bioethical Inquiry, clinical experience is married with historical and cultural context, ethical concerns are brought to bear on global health, and structural analyses shed light upon the lived experience of people living with TB. The relational and reciprocal dimensions of care feature strongly in these discussions, which serve as a poignant reminder that behind each of the yearly deaths from TB is a deeply personal story. No single discipline holds a monopoly on how to care for each of these people, but strong cases are made for support from mental health and social workers in addressing the kaleidoscope of needs in TB prevention. As the World Health Organization moves towards the goal of eliminating TB globally by 2050, attending to the needs of TB patients serves global interests to lower disease burden and to develop better integrated communities worldwide.",eng,Journal of bioethical inquiry,Historical Article,2025-04-23,2016

We excluded studies on monovalent pandemic influenza vaccine, vaccine safety, immunogenicity and uptake, and disease burden.--NEW SECTION--Seventy-four countries in the tropics and subtropics representing 60% of the world's population did not have a national vaccination policy against seasonal influenza. Thirty-eight countries used the Northern Hemisphere and 21 countries the Southern Hemisphere formulation. Forty-six countries targeted children and 57 targeted the elderly; though, the age cut-offs varied. Influenza vaccine supply increased twofold in recent years. However, coverage remained lower than five per 1000 population. Vaccine protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza in the tropics ranged from 0% to 42% in the elderly, 20-77% in children and 50-59% in healthy adults. Vaccinating pregnant women against seasonal influenza prevented laboratory-confirmed influenza in both mothers (50%) and their infants <6 months (49-63%).--NEW SECTION--Guidelines on vaccine composition, priority risk groups and vaccine availability varied widely.

Although large prospective clinical trials have shown that intensive control of blood glucose or blood pressure reduces the risk for development and progression of vascular complications in diabetes, a substantial number of diabetic patients still experience renal failure and cardiovascular events, which could account for disabilities and high mortality rate in these subjects. Objective Sulphoraphane is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate found in widely consumed cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage and Brussels sprouts, and an inducer of phase II antioxidant and detoxification enzymes with anticancer properties. We reviewed here the protective role of sulphoraphane against diabetic vascular complications. Methods In this review, literature searches were undertaken in Medline and in CrossRef. Non-English language articles were excluded. Keywords [sulphoraphane and (diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic complications, vascular, cardiomyocytes, heart or glycation)] have been used to select the articles. Results There is accumulating evidence that sulphoraphane exerts beneficial effects on vascular damage in both cell culture and diabetic animal models via antioxidative properties. Furthermore, we have recently found that sulphoraphane inhibits in vitro formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), suppresses the AGE-induced inflammatory reactions in rat aorta by reducing receptor for AGEs (RAGE) expression and decreases serum levels of AGEs in humans. Conclusion These findings suggest that blockade of oxidative stress and/or the AGE-RAGE axis by sulphoraphane may be a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing vascular complications in diabetes.",eng,Pharmaceutical biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The aims of this study were to examine the HRQoL in patients undergoing a diagnostic evaluation for possible cancer due to non-specific symptoms and further to investigate the impact of socio-demographic and medical factors associated with HRQoL at the time of diagnosis.--NEW SECTION--This was a prospective, multicenter survey study that included patients who were referred for a diagnostic evaluation due to non-specific cancer symptoms. Participants completed the EORTC-QLQ-C30 quality of life scale before and after completing the diagnostic evaluation. The baseline and follow-up EORTC-QLQ-C30 scores were compared with reference populations. The impact of socio-demographic and medical factors on HRQoL at follow-up was explored by bootstrapped multivariate linear regression.--NEW SECTION--A total of 838 patients participated in the study; 680 (81%) also completed follow-up. Twenty-two percent of the patients received a cancer diagnosis at the end of follow-up. Patients presented initially with a high burden of symptoms, less role and emotional functioning and a lower global health/QoL. Most domains improved after diagnosis and no clinically important difference between baseline and follow-up scores was found. Patients reported effects on HRQoL both at baseline and at follow-up compared with the Danish reference population and had similar scores as a cancer reference population. Co-morbidity, being unemployed and receiving a cancer diagnosis had the greatest effect on HRQoL around the time of diagnosis.--NEW SECTION--Patients with non-specific symptoms reported an affected HRQoL while undergoing a diagnostic evaluation for possible cancer.

The negative impact of MRB, due to its interference on patients' daily lives and effects on well-being, its influence on patients' beliefs and behaviours, and a potential risk for drug-related problems (DRPs) was evident. This resulted in non-adherence and poorer outcomes (unachieved therapeutic goals and damage to patients' health). Patients who experienced MRB interference in their life over time begin to juggle their medicines. Others continue their medicines despite experiencing MRB resulting in compromised physical, social or psychological well-being.--NEW SECTION--There is a shared commonality of PLEM among the studies. MRB plays a central role in influencing patients' health and well-being, beliefs and behaviour towards medicines. Given the complexity of MRB and its impact evident from this review, there is a need for healthcare practitioners to have insight into PLEM in therapeutic care plans. Understanding PLEM is an opportunity for practitioners to identify particular MRBs that patients encounter, and provide individualised care through selection of therapeutic care plans that suit a patient's life.

In order for health care providers to effectively attract patients, more knowledge is needed on the mechanisms underlying decision-making of potential travelers from different countries. A particularly promising method of studying the travelers' motives is collecting data on social media.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this study was to test what factors influence decision-making of potential medical travelers and how these factors interact. Based on existing literature, the factors analyzed included quality, cost, and waiting time for 2 procedures varying in invasiveness across 12 different destination countries.--NEW SECTION--Decision-making patterns were examined using a pilot questionnaire that generated a large amount of data from over 800 participants in 40 countries. Participants indicated their willingness to travel given different scenarios. Each scenario consisted of a combination of several factors. Additionally, participants were asked to indicate the reasons for their choice.--NEW SECTION--Individuals display high willingness to travel for medical care when combining all participants and scenarios, travel for care was chosen 66.9% of the time. Among the factors influencing their decisions, quality of the medical procedure abroad was considered most important, and cost was least important as shown by chi-square tests and corresponding odds ratios. Log-linear analyses revealed an interaction between time waiting in the local health care system and type of procedure, whereby time pressure increased the odds of agreeing to travel for the more invasive procedure. The odds of traveling to Europe and the USA were by far the highest, although participants indicated that under certain conditions they might be willing to travel to other medical destinations, such as Asia.--NEW SECTION--Our measurements yielded several reliable insights into the factors driving medical decision-making.

26828329,10.1002/0471140856.tx1413s67,The Use of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for the Study and Treatment of Liver Diseases.,"Liver disease is a major global health concern. Liver cirrhosis is one of the leading causes of death in the world and currently the only therapeutic option for end-stage liver disease (e.g., acute liver failure, cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, cholestatic diseases, metabolic diseases, and malignant neoplasms) is orthotropic liver transplantation. Transplantation of hepatocytes has been proposed and used as an alternative to whole organ transplant to stabilize and prolong the lives of patients in some clinical cases. Although these experimental therapies have demonstrated promising and beneficial results, their routine use remains a challenge due to the shortage of donor livers available for cell isolation, variable quality of those tissues, the potential need for lifelong immunosuppression in the transplant recipient, and high costs. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies and more reliable clinical treatments are urgently needed. Recent and continuous technological advances in the development of stem cells suggest they may be beneficial in this respect. In this review, we summarize the history of stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology in the context of hepatic differentiation and discuss the potential applications the technology may offer for human liver disease modeling and treatment. This includes developing safer drugs and cell-based therapies to improve the outcomes of patients with currently incurable health illnesses. We also review promising advances in other disease areas to highlight how the stem cell technology could be applied to liver diseases in the future. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",eng,Current protocols in toxicology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

26825296,10.1007/s11673-016-9706-4,What Do the Various Principles of Justice Mean Within the Concept of Benefit Sharing?,"The concept of benefit sharing pertains to the act of giving something in return to the participants, communities, and the country that have participated in global health research or bioprospecting activities. One of the key concerns of benefit sharing is the ethical justifications or reasons to support the practice of the concept in global health research and bioprospecting. This article evaluates one of such ethical justifications and its meaning to benefit sharing, namely justice. We conducted a systematic review to map the various principles of justice that are linked to benefit sharing and analysed their meaning to the concept of benefit sharing. Five principles of justice (commutative, distributive, global, procedural, and compensatory) have been shown to be relevant in the nuances of benefit sharing in both global health research and bioprospecting. The review findings indicate that each of these principles of justice provides a different perspective for a different benefit sharing rationale. For example, commutative justice provides a benefit sharing rationale that is focused on fair exchange of benefits between research sponsors and communities. Distributive justice produces a benefit sharing rationale that is focused on improving the health needs of the vulnerable research communities. We have suggested that a good benefit sharing framework particularly in global health research would be more beneficial if it combines all the principles of justice in its formulation. Nonetheless, there is a need for empirical studies to examine the various principles of justice and their nuances in benefit sharing among stakeholders in global health research.",eng,Journal of bioethical inquiry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Various effective weight-loss diets have been developed, including the Atkins diet. The Atkins diet is known as an extreme low-carbohydrate diet. This diet reduces body weight and has gained widespread popularity. However, the metabolite profiles of such a diet have been shown to be detrimental to colonic health. Therefore, a concern for the long-term health effects of this diet exists. We encountered a case in which ulcerative colitis developed while the patient was following the Atkins diet.A man, 172 cm in height and weighing 72 kg, at age 36 years followed a low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet. His weight decreased to 66 kg as desired. Thereafter he noticed bloody stool. Colonoscopy revealed diffuse inflammation limited to the rectum, and he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. He underwent an educational hospitalization for ulcerative colitis. A plant-based/semivegetarian diet was provided during hospitalization. Bloody stool disappeared during hospitalization and he achieved remission without medication for inflammatory bowel disease.This case indicates that an onset of ulcerative colitis can be an adverse event to a low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet.",eng,The Permanente journal,Case Reports,2025-04-23,2016

Task shifting has been recommended by the World Health Organization to increase access to trained and skilled birth attendants. One example of task shifting is the use of cadres of health care workers, such as nurses and auxiliary nurse-midwives, who can successfully deliver skilled care to women and infants in low-resource areas where women would otherwise lack access to critical health interventions during the childbearing years. Midwives for Haiti is an organization demonstrating the use of task shifting in its education program for auxiliary midwives. Graduates of the Midwives for Haiti education program are employed and working with women in hospitals, birth centers, and clinics across Haiti.

Overproduction of free radicals and oxidative stress has been associated with the development of diabetic complications. In the present study, the antioxidant effects of metformin (MET), glibenclamide (GLI), and repaglinide (REP) were evaluated in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The findings from this study may possibly help in understanding the efficacy of these standard drugs in managing the complications arising from diabetes mellitus (DM). Alloxan (130 mg/kg BW) was administered as a single dose to induce diabetes. Four (4) groups of rats (n = 6) were used; group 1 served as diabetic control while groups 2, 3, and 4 were the diabetic test groups that received MET (25 mg/kg), GLI (2.5 mg/kg), and REP (0.5 mg/kg), respectively. The result of the study showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in the altered antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT) and GSH concentration in diabetic treated rats compared with the diabetic control group. MET and REP produced significant effect on the MDA concentration while GLI showed insignificant reduction in the MDA concentration compared with the diabetic control. Findings from this study suggest that the administration of MET, GLI, and REP exerts significant antioxidant effects in alloxan-induced diabetic rats, thus contributing to the protective effect against oxidative stress-induced damage during diabetic complications.",eng,Journal of diabetes research,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016

Only few problem drinkers seek professional care, unfortunately, because of multiple barriers such as insufficient change motivation, fear of stigmatization or limited access to care. The aim of this study will be to examine the effectiveness of a novel Internet intervention termed Vorvida, which was developed based on established cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques with the aim of reducing problematic alcohol consumption.--NEW SECTION--A two-arm randomized control trial (RCT) will be conducted to determine whether using Vorvida results in greater reductions in self-reported problem drinking, compared with a care-as-usual/waitlist (CAU/WL) control group. There will be a baseline assessment (t0) and follow-up assessments after three (t1) and six months (t2). Inclusion criteria will be: minimum age of 18, an average consumption of alcohol >24/12 g (men/women) per day and an AUDIT-C score ≥ 3, as well as informed consent.

We sought to pool results of anesthesia care capacity assessments in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to identify patterns of deficits and provide useful targets for advocacy and intervention.--NEW SECTION--A systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar identified reports that documented anesthesia care capacity from LMICs. When multiple assessments from one country were identified, only the study with the most facilities assessed was included. Patterns of availability or deficit were described.--NEW SECTION--We identified 22 LMICs (15 low- and 8 middle-income countries) with anesthesia care capacity assessments (614 facilities assessed). Anesthesia care resources were often unavailable, including relatively low-cost ones (e.g., oxygen and airway supplies). Capacity varied markedly between and within countries, regardless of the national income. The availability of fundamental resources for safe anesthesia, such as airway supplies and functional pulse oximeters, was often not reported (72 and 36 % of hospitals assessed, respectively). Anesthesia machines and the capability to perform general anesthesia were unavailable in 43 % (132/307 hospitals) and 56 % (202/361) of hospitals, respectively.--NEW SECTION--We identified a pattern of critical deficiencies in anesthesia care capacity in LMICs, including some low-cost, high-value added resources.

While there are a number of nonsurgical and surgical options for treatment, the incidence of obesity continues to increase at an alarming rate. The inability to curtail the growing rise of the obesity epidemic may be related to a combination of increased food availability and palatability. Research into feeding behavior has yielded a number of insights into the homeostatic and reward mechanisms that govern feeding. However, there remains a gap between laboratory investigations of feeding physiology in animals and translation into meaningful treatment options for humans. In addition, laboratory investigation may not be able to recapitulate all aspects of human food consumption. In a landmark pilot study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the lateral hypothalamic area for obesity, we found that there was an increase in resting metabolic rate as well as a decreased urge to eat.

HCV vaccine development is vital in the effort toward disease control and eradication, an undertaking aided by an increased understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). In this study, we identified HCV codons that vary deep in a phylogenetic tree of HCV sequences and showed that a polymorphism at one of these positions renders Bole1a, a computationally derived, ancestral genotype 1a HCV strain, resistant to neutralization by both polyclonal-HCV-infected plasma and multiple broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies with unique binding epitopes. This bNAb resistance mutation reduces replicative fitness, which may explain the persistence of both neutralization-sensitive and neutralization-resistant variants in circulating viral strains. This work identifies an important determinant of bNAb resistance in an ancestral, representative HCV genome, which may inform HCV vaccine development.--NEW SECTION--Worldwide, more than 170 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation in the United States. Despite recent significant advances in HCV treatment, a vaccine is needed. Control of the HCV pandemic with drug treatment alone is likely to fail due to limited access to treatment, reinfections in high-risk individuals, and the potential for resistance to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) block infection by diverse HCV variants and therefore serve as a useful guide for vaccine development, but our understanding of resistance to bNAbs is incomplete.

The prognosis of clinically active tuberculosis depends on the complex interactions between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and its host. In recent years, autophagy receives particular attention for its role in host defense against intracellular pathogens, including Mtb. In present study, we aim to investigate the relationship of autophagy induction by clinical isolates of Mtb with the clinical outcomes in patients with TB.--NEW SECTION--We collected 185 clinical isolates of Mtb, and determined the effect of these Mtb isolates on autophagy induction in macrophages. It was found that most of clinical isolates of Mtb were able to induce autophagosome formation in macrophages, however, the autophagy-inducing ability varied significantly among different isolates. Of importance, our results revealed that patients infected by Mtb with poor autophagy-inducing ability displayed more severe radiographic extent of disease (p<0.001), and were more likely to have unfavorable treatment outcomes (p<0.001). No significant association was observed between the extent of Mtb-induced autophagy with some socio-demographic characteristics (such as gender, age and tobacco consumption), and some laboratory tests (such as hemoglobin, leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Furthermore, results from logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the defect in autophagy induction by clinical isolates of Mtb was an independent risk factor for far-advanced radiographic disease (aOR 4.710 [1.93-11.50]) and unfavorable treatment outcomes (aOR 8.309 [2.22-28.97]) in TB.--NEW SECTION--These data indicated that the defect in autophagy induction by Mtb isolates increased the risk of poor clinical outcomes in TB patients, and detection of clinical isolates-induced autophagosome formation might help evaluate the TB outcomes.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Quantitative monitoring of anthelminthic responses is crucial for promptly detecting changes in efficacy, potentially indicative of emerging drug resistance. Statistical models offer a powerful means to delineate and compare efficacy among individuals, among groups of individuals and among populations.--NEW SECTION--We illustrate a variety of statistical frameworks that offer different levels of inference by analysing data from nine previous studies on egg counts collected from African children before and after administration of praziquantel.--NEW SECTION--We quantify responses to praziquantel as egg reduction rates (ERRs), using different frameworks to estimate ERRs among population strata, as average responses, and within strata, as individual responses.

Population modelling methods were used to evaluate single metrics for their ability to reflect changes in disease activity with a view to understanding and improving composite indices.--NEW SECTION--A total of 11 single metrics of RA disease activity (tender and swollen joint counts, acute phase reactants and global health, pain and physical function assessments) were obtained from 203 patients with recent onset RA. Participants received combination disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) according to a treat-to-target approach with a pre-defined protocol for treatment intensification.

Measures that displayed uniformly large changes between states across the population were ranked higher in terms of discriminatory capacity.--NEW SECTION--Joint counts demonstrated a greater ability to discriminate changes in RA disease activity than others. Correlations between metrics demonstrated that erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) had limited relationships with others for baseline scores and changes in RA disease activity (r generally < 0.2). However it appeared to be important in describing changes for those individuals where ESR levels were initially elevated.--NEW SECTION--It appears unlikely that a single group of metrics may be suitable to capture disease activity changes across all RA patients and defining the most appropriate metric(s) for individual patients will be an important area of future research.",eng,British journal of clinical pharmacology,Clinical Trial,2025-04-23,2016

The following was done for all participants: thorough history, physical examination, thyroid ultrasound, measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxin (FT4), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) and assessment of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) level.--NEW SECTION--Overt hypothyroidism was detected in 42/56 while subclinical hypothyroidism was detected in 14/56 of the studied patients. Vitamin D deficiency rate was significantly higher in the AIT group compared to the control subjects (71.4 vs 21.4 %, P < 0.001). In AIT group, the mean level of 25OHD was significantly lower compared to the control group (16.2 ± 8.2 vs 33.9 ± 12.7 nmol/L, P < 0.001). The difference was more evident in patients with overt hypothyroidism than those with subclinical hypothyroidism (P < 0.01). There were significant negative correlations between serum 25OHD and age, duration of the disease, BMI, anti-TPOAb, anti-TGAb and TSH (P < 0.001 each). On the other hand, serum 25OHD correlated positively with FT4 levels. While 25OHD level was an independent risk factor for AIT, it failed to qualify as an independent risk for the progression of AIT to overt hypothyroidism after adjustment for other potential confounding factors; age, sex and BMI.--NEW SECTION--Low serum vitamin D is significantly associated with AIT in Egyptian children. However, vitamin D level is not an independent risk for the progression of AIT to overt hypothyroidism. BMI may have an influence on serum 25OHD levels.",eng,Journal of endocrinological investigation,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26808747,10.1097/SAP.0000000000000721,The Expanding Role of Education and Research in International Healthcare.,"A recent report of the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery has continued to emphasize the importance of surgery in global health. Plastic surgeons have been involved in humanitarian care of children in developing countries for many years. The ability to repair children with cleft lip and palate in resource-poor settings has made this desirable for many plastic surgeons. A number of philanthropic plastic surgery organizations arose to deal with the problem in a more structured way. Dr. Donald Laub at Stanford established Interplast (now ReSurg) in 1969. Dr. Bill and Kathy Magee established Operation Smile in 1982, and many others have followed. The unifying theme of these organizations has been the desire to provide safe and effective surgical care to children who would otherwise be forced to live out their lives with deformity. Most care has been for children with clefts, but efforts have expanded to include hand surgery and burn reconstruction. The initial effort was provided through surgical missions. A paradigm shift has occurred as sustainability and local capacity have become paramount. Education and training of local colleagues and assistance in surgical safety infrastructure are expanding the reach of plastic surgical care around the globe. The inauguration of in-country permanent surgical centers allows high-volume outcomes research, as well as unique educational collaboration between plastic surgeons of both the developed and developing world.",eng,Annals of plastic surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The combination of these two forces poses a potentially grave threat to global health, in both developed and developing countries. Current market forces do not provide appropriate incentives to stimulate new antibiotic development, thus we propose a new incentive mechanism: the Options Market for Antibiotics. This mechanism, modelled on the principle of financial call options, allows payers to buy the right, in early stages of development, to purchase antibiotics at a discounted price if and when they ever make it to market approval. This paper demonstrates the effect of such a model on the expected Net Present Value of a typical antibacterial project. As part of an integrated strategy to confront the impending antibiotic crisis, the Options Market for Antibiotics may effectively stimulate corporate and public investment into antibiotic research and development.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26808103,10.1002/ajpa.22906,Biocultural perspectives on maternal mortality and obstetrical death from the past to the present.,"Global efforts to improve maternal health are the fifth focus goal of the Millennium Development Goals adopted by the international community in 2000. While maternal mortality is an epidemic, and the death of a woman in childbirth is tragic, certain assumptions that frame the risk of death for reproductive aged women continue to hinge on the anthropological theory of the ""obstetric dilemma."" According to this theory, a cost of hominin selection to bipedalism is the reduction of the pelvic girdle; in tension with increasing encephalization, this reduction results in cephalopelvic disproportion, creating an assumed fragile relationship between a woman, her reproductive body, and the neonates she gives birth to. This theory, conceived in the 19th century, gained traction in the paleoanthropological literature in the mid-20th century. Supported by biomedical discourses, it was cited as the definitive reason for difficulties in human birth. Bioarchaeological research supported this narrative by utilizing demographic parameters that depict the death of young women from reproductive complications. But the roles of biomedical and cultural practices that place women at higher risk for morbidity and early mortality are often not considered. This review argues that reinforcing the obstetrical dilemma by framing reproductive complications as the direct result of evolutionary forces conceals the larger health disparities and risks that women face globally. The obstetrical dilemma theory shifts the focus away from other physiological and cultural components that have evolved in concert with bipedalism to ensure the safe delivery of mother and child. It also sets the stage for a framework of biological determinism and structural violence in which the reproductive aged female is a product of her pathologized reproductive body. But what puts reproductive aged women at risk for higher rates of morbidity and mortality goes far beyond the reproductive body. Moving beyond reproduction as the root causes of health inequalities reveals gendered-based oppression and inequality in health analyses. In this new model, maternal mortality can be seen as a sensitive indicator of inequality and social development, and can be explored for what it is telling us about women's health and lives. This article reviews the research in pelvic architecture and cephalopelvic relationships from the subfields of evolutionary biology, paleoanthropology, bioarchaeology, medical anthropology, and medicine, juxtaposing it with historical, ethnographic, and global maternal health analyses to offer a biocultural examination of maternal mortality and reproductive risk management. It reveals the structural violence against reproductive aged women inherent in the biomedical management of birth. By reframing birth as normal, not pathological, global health initiatives can consider new policies that focus on larger issues of disparity (e.g., poverty, lack of education, and poor nutrition) and support better health outcomes across the spectrum of life for women globally.",eng,American journal of physical anthropology,Historical Article,2025-04-23,2016
26807755,10.1086/684391,Quantifying Global Drivers of Zoonotic Bat Viruses: A Process-Based Perspective.,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), particularly zoonoses, represent a significant threat to global health. Emergence is often driven by anthropogenic activity (e.g., travel, land use change). Although disease emergence frameworks suggest multiple steps from initial zoonotic transmission to human-to-human spread, there have been few attempts to empirically model specific steps. We create a process-based framework to separate out components of individual emergence steps. We focus on early emergence and expand the first step, zoonotic transmission, into processes of generation of pathogen richness, transmission opportunity, and establishment, each with its own hypothesized drivers. Using this structure, we build a spatial empirical model of these drivers, taking bat viruses shared with humans as a case study. We show that drivers of both viral richness (host diversity and climatic variability) and transmission opportunity (human population density, bushmeat hunting, and livestock production) are associated with virus sharing between humans and bats. We also show spatial heterogeneity between the global patterns of these two processes, suggesting that high-priority locations for pathogen discovery and surveillance in wildlife may not necessarily coincide with those for public health intervention. Finally, we offer direction for future studies of zoonotic EIDs by highlighting the importance of the processes underlying their emergence.",eng,The American naturalist,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Because silicosis is a preventable disease, all efforts should be focused on preventing exposure to crystalline silica and thus development of the disease.--NEW SECTION--Denim sandblasters are at a high risk of silicosis. Patients with silicosis because of denim sandblasting exhibit rapid disease progression, and many of the complications associated with silicosis, including death, appear to be unavoidable. Thus, understanding the damage mechanism underlying silicosis in the lungs may help introduce treatment options to delay or reverse the progression of the disease. Silicosis because of denim sandblasting remains an important global health concern, particularly in low and middle-income countries.--NEW SECTION--Clinicians should be aware of potential occupational diseases, such as silicosis because of denim sandblasting, in unrecognized areas. To achieve success in the prevention of silicosis, occupational hygiene measures for crystalline silica should be supported by campaigns to not use sandblasted jeans worldwide.",eng,Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Antimalarial therapeutics acting via novel mechanisms are urgently required. Plasmodium falciparum M1 and M17 are neutral aminopeptidases which are essential for parasite growth and development. Previous work in our group has identified inhibitors capable of dual inhibition of PfA-M1 and PfA-M17, and revealed further regions within the protease S1 pockets that could be exploited in the development of ligands with improved inhibitory activity. Herein, we report the structure-based design and synthesis of novel hydroxamic acid analogues that are capable of potent inhibition of both PfA-M1 and PfA-M17. Furthermore, the developed compounds potently inhibit Pf growth in culture, including the multi-drug resistant strain Dd2.

Mixed cryoglobulinemia, a B-cell ""benign"" lymphoproliferative disorders, represents the most closely related as well as the most investigated HCV-related extrahepatic disorder. Since this virus is able to determine extrahepatic [non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)] as well as hepatic malignancies (hepatocellular carcinoma), HCV has been included among human cancer viruses. The most common histological types of HCV-associated NHL are the marginal zone, the lymphoplasmacytic and diffuse large cell lymphomas. The role of the HCV in the pathogenesis of the B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders is confirmed also by the responsiveness of the NHL to antiviral therapy. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the recent literature and a meta analysis of the epidemiology data, to explain the role of HCV in the development of NHL's lymphoma. Furthermore, the possibility to treat these HCV-related NHL with the antiviral therapy or with other therapeutic options, like chemotherapy, is also discussed.",eng,World journal of hepatology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Observational studies have reported an inverse association between coffee and cirrhosis.--NEW SECTION--To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterise the relationship between coffee consumption and cirrhosis.--NEW SECTION--We searched for studies published until July 2015 that reported odds ratios, relative risks (RR) or hazard ratios for cirrhosis stratified by coffee consumption. We calculated RRs of cirrhosis for an increase in daily coffee consumption of two cups for each study and overall. We performed analyses by study design, type of cirrhosis and mortality. We assessed the risk of bias in each study and the overall quality of evidence for the effect of coffee on cirrhosis.--NEW SECTION--We identified five cohort studies and four case-control studies involving 1990 cases and 432 133 participants. We observed a dose-response in most studies and overall. The pooled RR of cirrhosis for a daily increase in coffee consumption of two cups was 0.56 (95% CI 0.44-0.68; I(2) 83.3%). The RR pooled from cohort studies for a daily increase of two cups was 0.58 (95% CI 0.41-0.76; I(2) 91.1%) and from case-control studies it was 0.52 (95% CI 0.40-0.63; I(2) 0.0%). The pooled RR of alcoholic cirrhosis for a daily increase of two cups was 0.62 (95% CI 0.51-0.73; I(2) 0%) and of death from cirrhosis it was 0.55 (95% CI 0.35-0.74; I(2) 90.3%).--NEW SECTION--This meta-analysis suggests that increasing coffee consumption may substantially reduce the risk of cirrhosis.",eng,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In Gram-negative bacteria the low permeability of the outer membrane (OM) is a major factor contributing to resistance, making it important to understand channel-mediated small-molecule passage of the OM. Acinetobacter baumannii has five Occ (OM carboxylate channel) proteins, which collectively are of major importance for the entry of small molecules. To improve our understanding of the OM permeability of A. baumannii, we present here the X-ray crystal structures of four Occ proteins, renamed OccAB1 to OccAB4. In addition we have carried out a biochemical and biophysical characterization using electrophysiology and liposome swelling experiments, providing information on substrate specificities. We identify OccAB1 as having the largest pore of the Occ proteins with corresponding high rates of small-molecule uptake, and we suggest that the future design of efficient antibiotics should focus on scaffolds that can permeate efficiently through the OccAB1 channel.",eng,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Additionally, timely detection of infectious agents is critical in early diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Conventional pathogen detection methods such as culturing, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) require long assay times, and complex and expensive instruments making them not adaptable to point-of-care (PoC) needs at resource-constrained places and primary care settings. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop portable, simple, rapid, and accurate methods for PoC detection of infections. Here, we present the development and validation of a portable, robust and inexpensive electrochemical magnetic microbeads-based biosensor (EMBIA) platform for PoC serodiagnosis of infectious diseases caused by different types of microorganisms (parasitic protozoa, bacteria and viruses). We demonstrate the potential use of the EMBIA platform for in situ diagnosis of human (Chagas disease and human brucellosis) and animal (bovine brucellosis and foot-and-mouth disease) infections clearly differentiating infected from non-infected individuals or animals. For Chagas disease, a more extensive validation of the test was performed showing that the EMBIA platform displayed an excellent diagnostic performance almost indistinguishable, in terms of specificity and sensitivity, from a fluorescent immunomagnetic assay and the conventional ELISA using the same combination of antigens. This platform technology could potentially be applicable to diagnose other infectious and non-infectious diseases as well as detection and/or quantification of biomarkers at the POC and primary care settings.",eng,Biosensors & bioelectronics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, the relationship between vitamin D status, body composition, and cardiovascular risks has not been well characterized in Asian populations. The objectives of this study were to examine the factors associated with the low vitamin D levels in a sunny tropical region and to assess the role of vitamin D status in cardiovascular risk factors.--NEW SECTION--This was a cross-sectional study. One hundred and fourteen healthy participants (59 males and 55 females) residing in Singapore took part in this study. Plasma 25OH-D3 concentration was measured by using LC-MS/MS. Body fat (%) was measured by using three different techniques including bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), BOD POD, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Basic anthropometric measurements, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting serum insulin (FSI), and lipid profiles were obtained using standard protocols.--NEW SECTION--Approximately 42% of the participants were vitamin D deficient (< 20 ng/mL). Vitamin D status was inversely associated with body fat (%), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein (TC/HDL) ratio, while positively associated with lean body mass (LBM) and hand grip strength (HGS).--NEW SECTION--The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in a sunny tropical region reinforces the need to recognize that sunlight alone is not the precursor for optimal vitamin D status. This raises the need to investigate public health measures that will encourage exposure to sunlight without overexposure that is harmful to skin. More importantly, vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased cardiovascular risks, i.e. HOMA-IR, TC/HDL, and LDL/HDL.

Iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which are crucial regulators of human metabolism, cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis and have been reported to be involved in carcinogenesis. In this study, for the first time, we evaluated the effect of iodine-biofortified lettuce on transcriptomic profile of Caco-2 cancer cell line by applying the Whole Human Genome Microarray assay. We showed 1326 differentially expressed Caco-2 transcripts after treatment with iodine-biofortified (BFL) and non-fortified (NFL) lettuce extracts. We analysed pathways, molecular functions, biological processes and protein classes based on comparison between BFL and NFL specific genes. Iodine, which was expected to act as a free ion (KI-NFL) or at least in part to be incorporated into lettuce macromolecules (BFL), differently regulated pathways of numerous transcription factors leading to different cellular effects. In this study we showed the inhibition of Caco-2 cells proliferation after treatment with BFL, but not potassium iodide (KI), and BFL-mediated induction of mitochondrial apoptosis and/or cell differentiation. Our results showed that iodine-biofortified plants can be effectively used by cells as an alternative source of this trace element.

The reasons for plague's persistence and abrupt disappearance in Europe are poorly understood, but could have been due to either the presence of now-extinct plague foci in Europe itself, or successive disease introductions from other locations. Here we present five Y. pestis genomes from one of the last European outbreaks of plague, from 1722 in Marseille, France. The lineage identified has not been found in any extant Y. pestis foci sampled to date, and has its ancestry in strains obtained from victims of the 14th century Black Death. These data suggest the existence of a previously uncharacterized historical plague focus that persisted for at least three centuries. We propose that this disease source may have been responsible for the many resurgences of plague in Europe following the Black Death.",eng,eLife,Historical Article,2025-04-23,2016

Biomarkers of the early phase of this progressive disease are of utmost importance for global health. In this context, saliva represents a non-invasive biosample. By using systems biology tools, we aimed to (1) identify an integrated interactome between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-REDOX/nitric oxide (NO) and apoptosis upstream pathways of periodontal inflammation, and (2) characterize the attendant topological network properties to uncover putative biomarkers to be tested in saliva from patients with periodontitis. Hence, we first generated a protein-protein network model of interactions (""BIOMARK"" interactome) by using the STRING 10 database, a search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins, with ""Experiments"" and ""Databases"" as input options and a confidence score of 0.400. Second, we determined the centrality values (closeness, stress, degree or connectivity, and betweenness) for the ""BIOMARK"" members by using the Cytoscape software. We found Ubiquitin C (UBC), Jun proto-oncogene (JUN), and matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14) as the most central hub- and non-hub-bottlenecks among the 211 genes/proteins of the whole interactome. We conclude that UBC, JUN, and MMP14 are likely an optimal candidate group of host-derived biomarkers, in combination with oral pathogenic bacteria-derived proteins, for detecting periodontitis at its early phase by using salivary samples from patients.

Community health workers (CHWs) effectively improve health outcomes, but the best means for CHWs reaching rural populations is unknown. Since Zambia is predominantly Christian, this study explored the use of CHWs through churches as an existing community structure for promoting preventive health behaviors, specifically rotavirus vaccine uptake.--NEW SECTION--A noncontrolled cross-sectional study of 32 churches receiving a packaged intervention of diarrhea prevention and treatment messaging was conducted with repeated time points of data collection over 13 months (2013-2014) in the Kafue District of Zambia. Two churches were selected for each of the 17 catchment areas, and CHWs were identified and trained in the intervention of promoting 4 key messages related to diarrhea prevention and treatment: hand washing with soap, exclusive breast-feeding, rotavirus vaccination, and treating diarrhea with oral rehydration solution and zinc. The intervention was conducted within existing church's women's groups, and data was collected on attendance and the distribution of Rota Cards for tracking rotavirus immunizations.--NEW SECTION--Nineteen (59%) churches completed the study, and CHWs delivered health messages at a total of 890 women's group meetings.

26791088,10.1186/s12936-015-1065-9,Localization and interactions of Plasmodium falciparum SWIB/MDM2 homologues.,"Malaria remains a global health problem and the majority of deaths are caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Due to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant strains, novel avenues of research on the biology of the parasite are needed. The massive proliferation of asexual, intra-erythrocytic parasites every 48 h could kill the human host prior to transmission of slow-developing gametocytes to the mosquito vector. A self-induced P. falciparum programmed cell death mechanism has been hypothesized to maintain this balance between the parasite and its two hosts, but molecular participants of the cell death pathway in P. falciparum have not been characterized. Proteins with SWIB/MDM2 domains play a key role in metazoan programmed cell death and this study provides the first evaluation of two parasite SWIB/MDM2 homologues, PF3D7_0518200 (PfMDM2) and PF3D7_0611400 (PfSWIB).--NEW SECTION--The function of these proteins was assessed by predicting their structural topology with the aid of bioinformatics and determining their location within live transgenic parasites, expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged PfMDM2 and PfSWIB under normal and elevated temperatures, which mimic fever and which are known to induce a programmed cell death response. Additionally, P. falciparum phage display library technology was used to identify binding partners for the two parasite SWIB/MDM2 domains.--NEW SECTION--Structural features of the SWIB/MDM2 domains of PfMDM2 and PfSWIB, suggested that they are chromatin remodelling factors. The N-terminal signal sequence of PfMDM2 directed the protein to the mitochondrion under both normal and heat stress conditions. Plasmodium falciparum phage display library technology revealed that the C-terminal SWIB/MDM2 domain of PfMDM2 interacted with a conserved protein containing a LisH domain. PfSWIB localized to the cytoplasm under normal growth conditions, while approximately 10% of the heat-stressed trophozoite-stage parasites presented a rapid but short-lived nuclear localization pattern. Two PfSWIB binding partners, a putative Aurora-related kinase and a member of the inner membrane complex, were identified.--NEW SECTION--These novel data provide insight into the function of two parasite SWIB/MDM2 homologues and suggest that PfMDM2 plays a role within the mitochondrion and that PfSWIB is involved in a stage-specific, heat-stress, response pathway.",eng,Malaria journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

While many fluorescence or photoluminescence-based smartphone assays have been reported in the literature, common shortcomings are the requirement of an excitation light source external to the smartphone and complicated integration of that excitation source with the smartphone. Here, we show that the photographic flash associated with the smartphone camera can be utilized to enable all-in-one excitation and imaging of photoluminescence (PL), thus eliminating the need for an excitation light source external to the smartphone. A simple and low-cost 3D-printed accessory was designed to create a dark environment and direct excitation light from the smartphone flash onto a sample. Multiple colors and compositions of semiconductor quantum dot (QD) were evaluated as photoluminescent materials for all-in-one smartphone excitation and imaging of PL, and these were compared with fluorescein and R-phycoerythrin (R-PE), which are widely utilized molecular and protein materials for fluorescence-based bioanalysis. The QDs were found to exhibit much better brightness and have the best potential for two-color detection. A model protein binding assay with a sub-microgram per milliliter detection limit and a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for proteolytic activity were demonstrated, including imaging with serum as a sample matrix. In addition, FRET within tandem conjugates of a QD donor and fluorescent dye acceptor enabled smartphone detection of dye fluorescence that was otherwise unobservable without the QD to enhance its brightness. The ideal properties of photoluminescent materials for all-in-one smartphone excitation and imaging are discussed in the context of several different materials, where QDs appear to be the best overall material for this application.",eng,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Higher education offers a platform for engineering to intersect with global health research through interdisciplinary partnerships among international universities that provide excellence in education, attract nontraditional STEM students, and foster a sense of innovation. However, a traditional lack of engineering-global health collaborations, as well as limited faculty and inadequate STEM research funding in low-income countries, has stifled progress. Still, the impact of higher education on development efforts holds great potential. This value will be realized in low-income countries through strengthening local capacity, supporting innovation through educational initiatives, and encouraging the inclusion of women and minorities in STEM programs. Current international university-level partnerships are working towards integrating engineering into global health research and strengthening STEM innovation among universities in low-income countries, but more can be done.

Most cases of HCC are secondary to either infection (hepatitis B or C) or cirrhosis (alcohol being the most common cause). Clinical presentation is variable and the tumour can be an incidental finding. Treatment options for HCC and prognosis are dependent on many factors but most importantly tumour size and staging. The last two decades have revolutionised the treatment of HCC using image-guided techniques. The concepts of imaging and image-guided techniques are still young and not well described in standard textbooks and hence an up to date review article is essential. The clinical subspecialities may lack familiarity with image-guided techniques but are responsible for management of these patients before and after the treatment by interventional radiologists. This article reviews current image-guided techniques, evidence and outcomes and provides educational highlights and question and answers.

26787832,10.1128/mBio.01996-15,Age Dependence and Isotype Specificity of Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin Stalk-Reactive Antibodies in Humans.,"Influenza remains a major global health burden. Seasonal vaccines offer protection but can be rendered less effective when the virus undergoes extensive antigenic drift. Antibodies that target the highly conserved hemagglutinin stalk can protect against drifted viruses, and vaccine constructs designed to induce such antibodies form the basis for a universal influenza virus vaccine approach. In this study, we analyzed baseline and postvaccination serum samples of children (6 to 59 months), adults (18 to 49 years), and elderly individuals (≥65 years) who participated in clinical trials with a recombinant hemagglutinin-based vaccine. We found that baseline IgG and IgA antibodies against the H1 stalk domain correlated with the ages of patients. Children generally had very low baseline titers and did not respond well to the vaccine in terms of making stalk-specific antibodies. Adults showed the highest induction of stalk-specific antibodies, but the elderly had the highest absolute antibody titers against the stalk. Importantly, the stalk antibodies measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed neutralizing activity in neutralization assays and protected mice in a passive-transfer model in a stalk titer-dependent manner. Finally, we found similar patterns of stalk-specific antibodies directed against the H3 and influenza B virus hemagglutinins, albeit at lower levels than those measured against the H1 stalk. The relatively high levels of stalk-specific antibodies in the elderly patients may explain the previously reported low influenza virus infection rates in this age group. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT00336453, NCT00539981, and NCT00395174.)--NEW SECTION--The present study provides evidence that titers of broadly neutralizing hemagglutinin stalk-reactive antibodies increase with age, possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses. These relatively high levels of antistalk titers may be responsible for lower circulation rates of influenza viruses in older individuals. Our findings suggest that the level of antistalk antibodies is a good surrogate marker for protection against influenza virus infection. In addition, the levels of antistalk antibodies might determine the breadth of protection against different drifted strains.",eng,mBio,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

For this reason, antenatal care (ANC) represents a vital component of efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. To elucidate the relationship between ANC services and HIV testing among pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa, we undertook an analysis of data from four countries.--NEW SECTION--Four countries (Congo, Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda) were purposively selected to represent unique geographical regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Using Demographic and Health Survey datasets, weighted crude and adjusted logistic regression models were used to explore factors that influenced HIV testing as part of ANC services. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Arizona.--NEW SECTION--Pooled results showed that 60.7% of women received HIV testing as part of ANC. Ugandan women had the highest rate of HIV testing as part of ANC (81.5%) compared with women in Mozambique (69.4%), Nigeria (54.4%) and Congo (45.4%). Difficulty reaching a health facility was a barrier in Congo and Mozambique but not Nigeria or Uganda. HIV testing rates were lower in rural areas, among the poorest women, the least educated and those with limited knowledge of HIV. In every country, crude regression analyses showed higher odds of being tested for HIV if women received their ANC services from a skilled attendant compared with an unskilled attendant. After adjusting for confounders, women in the total sample had 1.78 (99% CI: 1.45-2.18) times the odds of having an HIV test as part of their ANC if they went to a skilled attendant compared with an unskilled attendant.--NEW SECTION--There is a need for integration of HIV testing into routine ANC service to increase opportunities for PMTCT programmes to reach HIV-positive pregnant women. Attention should be paid to the expansion of outreach services for women in rural settings, and to the training, supervision and integration of unskilled attendants into formal maternal and child health programmes. Education of pregnant women and their communities is needed to increase HIV knowledge and reduce HIV stigma.",eng,Journal of the International AIDS Society,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Research interest in N-acetylcysteine has grown among increasing evidence of the role of oxidative stress in organophosphorus poisoning. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant treatment in patients with acute organophosphorus poisoning. This was a randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial on 30 patients suffering from acute organophosphorus poisoning, who were admitted to the Poison Control Center of Tanta University Emergency Hospital, Tanta, Egypt, between April and September 2014. Interventions included oral N-acetylcysteine (600 mg three times daily for 3 days) as an added treatment to the conventional measures versus only the conventional treatment. Outcome measures included mortality, total dose of atropine administered, duration of hospitalization and the need for ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation. A total of 46 patients were screened and 30 were randomized. No significant difference was found between both groups regarding demographic characteristics and the nature or severity of baseline clinical manifestations. No major adverse effects to N-acetylcysteine therapy were reported. Malondialdehyde significantly decreased and reduced glutathione significantly increased only in the NAC-treated patients. The patients on NAC therapy required less atropine doses than those who received only the conventional treatment; however, the length of hospital stay showed no significant difference between both groups. The study concluded that the use of N-acetylcysteine as an added treatment was apparently safe, and it reduced atropine requirements in patients with acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning.",eng,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Data extraction and quality appraisal of quantitative, qualitative and case studies meeting inclusion criteria were conducted using standardised methods with reliability checking.--NEW SECTION--Forty-four studies from Africa, Asia and Latin America met the inclusion criteria (17 on biogas, 12 on LPG, 9 on solar, 6 on alcohol fuels). A broad range of inter-related enabling and limiting factors were identified for all four types of intervention, operating across seven pre-specified domains (i.e. fuel and technology characteristics, household and setting characteristics, knowledge and perceptions, financial, tax and subsidy aspects, market development, regulation, legislation and standards, and programme and policy mechanisms) and multiple levels (i.e. household, community, national). All domains matter and the majority of factors are common to all clean fuels interventions reviewed although some are fuel and technology-specific. All factors should therefore be taken into account and carefully assessed during planning and implementation of any small- and large-scale initiative aiming at promoting clean fuels for household cooking.--NEW SECTION--Despite limitations in quantity and quality of the evidence this systematic review provides a useful starting point for the design, delivery and evaluation of programmes to ensure more effective adoption and use of LPG, biogas, alcohol fuels and solar cooking.--NEW SECTION--This review was funded by the Department for International Development (DfID) of the United Kingdom.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered a possible effective alternative to conventional antibiotic therapies. An understanding of the mechanism of action of AMPs is needed in order to better control and optimize their bactericidal activity. Plantaricin EF is a heterodimeric AMP, consisting of two peptides Plantaricin E (PlnE) and Plantaricin F (PlnF). We studied the behavior of these peptides on the surface of a model lipid bilayer. We identified the residues that facilitate peptide-peptide interactions. We also identified residues that mediate interactions of the dimer with the membrane. PlnE interacts with the membrane through amino acids at both its termini, while only the N terminus of PlnF approaches the membrane. By comparing the activity of single-site mutants of the two-peptide bacteriocin and the simulations of the bacteriocin on the surface of a model lipid bilayer, structure activity relationships are proposed. These studies allow us to generate hypotheses that relate biophysical interactions observed in simulations with the experimentally measured activity. We find that single-site amino acid substitutions result in markedly stronger antimicrobial activity when they strengthen the interactions between the two peptides, while, concomitantly, they weaken peptide-membrane association. This effect is more pronounced in the case of the PlnE mutant (G20A), which interacts the strongest with PlnF and the weakest with the membrane while displaying the highest activity.",eng,Biochimica et biophysica acta,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Case Study Application: Safety and Effectiveness of Iron Interventions.,"Paramount among the challenges to our ability to address the role of food and nutrition in health promotion and disease prevention is how to design and implement context-specific interventions and guidance. The Integration to Effective Implementation (I-to-I) concept is intended to address the complexities of the global health context through engagement of the continuum of stakeholders involved in the food and nutrition enterprise. The 2014 Micronutrient Forum (MNF) Global Conference held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in June 2014 offered the opportunity to apply the I-to-I approach with the use of current concerns about the safety and effectiveness of interventions to prevent and treat iron deficiency (ID) as a case study. ID is associated with a range of adverse outcomes, especially in pregnant and nonpregnant women, infants, and primary school-age children. Strategies to combat ID include iron supplementation, multiple micronutrient powders, and food-based interventions to enhance dietary iron intake. Recent reports indicate potential increased adverse risks when iron is provided in areas with high infection burdens (e.g., malaria). This paradox has weakened iron intervention programs. Furthermore, the selection and interpretation of available biomarkers for assessing iron nutrition have been found to be compromised by the inflammatory process. These issues highlight the need for a comprehensive approach that considers basic biology, assessment, interventions, and how these can be translated into appropriate programs and policies. The application of the I-to-I with the use of the MNF offered an opportunity to explore how that might be achieved.",eng,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Accordingly, in October 2014, a World Health Organization high-level meeting endorsed the concept of a phase 2/3 clinical trial in Liberia to study Ebola vaccines. As a follow-up to the global response, in November 2014, the Government of Liberia and the US Government signed an agreement to form a research partnership to investigate Ebola and to assess intervention strategies for treating, controlling, and preventing the disease in Liberia. This agreement led to the establishment of the Joint Liberia-US Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia as the beginning of a long-term collaborative partnership in clinical research between the two countries. In this article, we discuss the methodology and related challenges associated with the implementation of the Ebola vaccines clinical trial, based on a double-blinded randomized controlled trial, in Liberia.",eng,"Clinical trials (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

It is projected to worsen with the aging population worldwide. The lack of effective therapies underscores our incomplete understanding of this complex heterogeneous syndrome. A novel paradigm has recently emerged, in which central roles are ascribed to systemic inflammation and generalized endothelial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of HFPEF. In this review, we discuss the role of the endothelium in cardiovascular homeostasis and how deranged endothelial-related signaling pathways contribute to the development of HFPEF.

26765841,10.1371/journal.pone.0147007,Intrinsic Viral Factors Are the Dominant Determinants of the Hepatitis C Virus Response to Interferon Alpha Treatment in Chimeric Mice.,"Hepatitis C virus infection is a global health problem. New direct-acting antiviral agents have been recently approved. However, due to their high cost and some genotypes remaining difficult to treat, interferon-based therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin likely may remain a component of hepatitis C virus treatment for some patients. Unfortunately, pegylated interferon / ribavirin treatment achieved favorable outcomes in less than 50% of patients. Factors determining the outcome to pegylated interferon/ribavirin include both host and viral factors. It has been a major challenge to separate the host and viral factors in most in vivo systems.--NEW SECTION--We used two hepatitis C virus strains from patients with different interferon-sensitivities and three hepatocyte donors, each with distinct interleukin 28B and interferon lambda 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms to investigate the contributions of viral and host factors to the response of hepatitis C virus to interferon treatment in chimeric mice.--NEW SECTION--We found that viral factors were the dominant factors in determining the interferon treatment outcomes in chimeric mice. Host factors, such as pre-treatment liver interferon-stimulated gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms near interleukin 28B and interferon lambda 4 coding regions, were less important determinants of the response to interferon in the chimeric mice than they were in patients. Our results also suggest that a complete immune system as seen in patients may be required for host factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms near interleukin 28B/interferon lambda 4 and pre-treatment liver interferon-stimulated gene upregulation to have an effect on the interferon response.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Many studies have investigated the association between venous thromboembolism and heart failure, but have yielded inconsistent findings. We aimed to quantify the absolute and relative risks (RR) for venous thromboembolism in patients with heart failure after hospital admission. We also assessed rates of venous thromboembolism in patients in different settings.--NEW SECTION--In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched for studies investigating the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients in hospital with heart failure. We searched for studies published between Jan 1, 1955, and March 31, 2015, in PubMed, Embase, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Ovid HealthSTAR, Global Health, Ovid Nursing Database, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, ProQuest Central, Conference Papers Index, BIOSIS Previews, and ClinicalTrials.gov. All cohort studies and subgroup analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion if they reported venous thromboembolism rates (number of events per follow-up period) or RR estimates. We extracted data from published reports and contacted the corresponding authors of records with insufficient quantitative data. RRs and 95% CIs were pooled using a random-effects model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014015504.--NEW SECTION--Of 8673 records identified, we included 71 studies with data from 88 cohorts in our analysis, with 59 cohorts included in the assessment of venous thromboembolism rates and 46 cohorts included in the meta-analysis of heart failure and risk of venous thromboembolism. Venous thromboembolism rates varied widely in patients in hospital with heart failure from different settings. The overall median symptomatic venous thromboembolism rate was 2·48% (IQR 0·84-5·61); rates was were 3·73% (1·05-7·31) for patients who did not receive thromboprophylaxis and 1·47% (0·64-3·54) for those who did. Overall, patients with heart failure in hospital had an RR of 1·51 (1·36-1·68) for venous thromboembolism. The overall I(2) statistic was 96·1% and there was no evidence of publication bias (Egger's test, p=0·46).--NEW SECTION--Heart failure is a common independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism.

Even with public awareness, the incidence of FASD is estimated to be upwards of 5% in the general population and is becoming a global health problem. The physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments of FASD are recapitulated in animal models. Recently rodent models utilizing voluntary drinking paradigms have been developed that accurately reflect moderate consumption, which makes up the majority of FASD cases. The range in severity of FASD characteristics reflects the frequency, dose, developmental timing, and individual susceptibility to alcohol exposure. As most rodent models of FASD use C57BL/6 mice, there is a need to expand the stocks of mice studied in order to more fully understand the complex neurobiology of this disorder. To that end, we allowed pregnant Swiss Webster mice to voluntarily drink ethanol via the drinking in the dark (DID) paradigm throughout their gestation period. Ethanol exposure did not alter gestational outcomes as determined by no significant differences in maternal weight gain, maternal liquid consumption, litter size, or pup weight at birth or weaning. Despite seemingly normal gestation, ethanol-exposed offspring exhibit significantly altered timing to achieve developmental milestones (surface righting, cliff aversion, and open field traversal), as analyzed through mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards models. These results confirm Swiss Webster mice as a viable option to study the incidence and causes of ethanol-induced neurobehavioral alterations during development. Future studies in our laboratory will investigate the brain regions and molecules responsible for these behavioral changes.",eng,Behavioural brain research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Therapeutic vaccination has been successfully employed to treat a subpopulation of CHB patients. Personalized treatment can not only improve therapeutic efficacy, but also decrease the cost of medical care. Since microRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved and are involved in many cellular processes, exploring their expression profiles in CHB patients in association with responsiveness to therapeutic vaccination may be an approach for personalized treatment. In this study, we examined the kinetic expression profiles of 13 miRNAs in sera and serum-derived hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg) particles in 10 CHB patients including 5 responders and 5 nonresponders selected from a large cohort of 136 patients enroled in a phase III clinical trial using antigen-antibody immunogenic complex based therapeutic vaccine (YIC). Eight miRNAs were detected in both sera and HBsAg particles. Among them, the levels of serum miRNAs and serum-derived HBsAg-carried miRNAs (let-7f, miR-22, miR-30a, and miR-122) were significantly lower in the responders group compared to those in the nonresponders group at baseline and throughout the course of treatment. The lower baseline levels of serum miRNAs and HBsAg-carried miRNAs were also associated with hepatitis e antigen clearance at week 76 and hepatitis e antigen seroconversion during the study period. In summary, our study suggests that lower baseline levels of serum miRNAs and HBsAg-carried miRNAs (let-7f, miR-22, miR-30a, and miR-122) associated with YIC treatment response and the variation trend of these 4 miRNAs could have a prognostic value for responsiveness to YIC treatment.",eng,Medicine,"Clinical Trial, Phase III",2025-04-23,2016
26764469,10.1159/000436948,Applications of Nutritional Biomarkers in Global Health Settings.,"In global health settings, there are three generic areas that require reliable biomarkers of nutritional status and function. Population surveillance needs to identify key nutrient deficiencies (or excesses) to monitor progress towards elimination of nutritional imbalances and to stratify populations into groups especially 'at risk' to whom public health resources can be focused. Clinical interventions need biomarkers to help identify disease pathways, to assist in targeting nutrient prescriptions, and to avoid potential harm (e.g. in the case of iron). Discovery science requires biomarkers in many domains, but especially in the study of nutrient-gene interactions and regarding the effects of nutritional status on the epigenome. Each of these applications imposes different constraints on the methodology though in all cases the optimum biomarker would have high sensitivity and specificity, would capture variation of functional significance, and would be cheap and easy to apply. These attributes are hard to achieve, and recent progress towards next-generation biomarkers, though holding much promise, has not yet delivered significant breakthroughs in the global health setting. Recent efforts to overcome these problems by two initiatives (BOND and INSPIRE) are highlighted as exemplars of a route map to progress.",eng,Nestle Nutrition Institute workshop series,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The flavivirus lifecycle is intimately connected to cellular lipids. Among the lipids co-opted by flaviviruses, we have focused on SM, an important component of cellular membranes particularly enriched in the nervous system. After infection with the neurotropic WNV, mice deficient in acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), which accumulate high levels of SM in their tissues, displayed exacerbated infection. In addition, WNV multiplication was enhanced in cells from human patients with Niemann-Pick type A, a disease caused by a deficiency of ASM activity resulting in SM accumulation. Furthermore, the addition of SM to cultured cells also increased WNV infection, whereas treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of SM synthesis reduced WNV infection. Confocal microscopy analyses confirmed the association of SM with viral replication sites within infected cells. Our results unveil that SM metabolism regulates flavivirus infection in vivo and propose SM as a suitable target for antiviral design against WNV.",eng,Journal of lipid research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We evaluated the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and trauma outcomes using a prospective registry of patients presenting to the largest trauma hospital in Yaoundé, Cameroon.--NEW SECTION--Trauma patients (n=2855) presenting to the emergency ward at Central Hospital, Yaoundé between April 15 and October 15, 2009 were surveyed regarding demographic and socioeconomic background, nature and severity of injuries, treatment, and disposition. A wealth score was estimated for each patient, corresponding to an SES index constructed using principle components analysis of the urban Cameroonian Demographic and Health Survey. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effects of SES on care-seeking behaviour, injury severity, and treatment outcome.--NEW SECTION--SES wealth score, care-seeking prior to visiting hospital, injury severity, treatment outcome.--NEW SECTION--Patients aged 1-89 presented with road traffic injuries (59.83%), falls (7.76%), and penetrating trauma (6.16%), and had higher SES than the broader urban Cameroonian population. Within the Yaoundé sample, being in the lowest SES quintile was associated with an increased likelihood of having sought care elsewhere before presenting to the hospital (aOR=3.28, p<0.001), after controlling for background and injury characteristics. Patients in the lowest SES quintile were also more likely to present with moderate/severe injuries (aOR=4.93, p<0.001), and were more likely to be transferred to the operating room.--NEW SECTION--Patients presenting to this trauma centre were wealthier than the broader community, suggesting the possibility of barriers to accessing care. Poorer patients were more likely to have severe injuries and more likely to need surgery, but were less likely to seek care from a major trauma centre immediately. Substantial differences in SES between the sample visiting the hospital and the broader community suggest a need for community-based sampling approaches in future trauma research.",eng,Injury,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We aimed to establish whether untreated maternal HIV infection is associated with specific perinatal outcomes.--NEW SECTION--We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the scientific literature by searching PubMed, CINAHL (Ebscohost), Global Health (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and four clinical trial databases (WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, the ClinicalTrials.gov database, and the ISRCTN Registry) for studies published from Jan 1, 1980, to Dec 7, 2014. Two authors independently reviewed the studies retrieved by the scientific literature search, identified relevant studies, and extracted the data. We investigated the associations between maternal HIV infection in women naive to antiretroviral therapy and 11 perinatal outcomes: preterm birth, very preterm birth, low birthweight, very low birthweight, term low birthweight, preterm low birthweight, small for gestational age, very small for gestational age, miscarriage, stillbirth, and neonatal death. We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case-control studies reporting perinatal outcomes in HIV-positive women naive to antiretroviral therapy and HIV-negative controls. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analyses of specific perinatal outcomes. We did subgroup and sensitivity analyses and assessed the effect of adjustment for confounders. This systematic review and meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42013005638.--NEW SECTION--Of 60,750 studies identified, we obtained data from 35 studies (20 prospective cohort studies, 12 retrospective cohort studies, and three case-control studies) including 53 623 women. Our meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies show that maternal HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (relative risk 1·50, 95% CI 1·24-1·82), low birthweight (1·62, 1·41-1·86), small for gestational age (1·31, 1·14-1·51), and stillbirth (1·67, 1·05-2·66). Retrospective cohort studies also suggest an increased risk of term low birthweight (2·62, 1·15-5·93) and preterm low birthweight (3·25, 2·12-4·99). The strongest and most consistent evidence for these associations is identified in sub-Saharan Africa. No association was identified between maternal HIV infection and very preterm birth, very small for gestational age, very low birthweight, miscarriage, or neonatal death, although few data were available for these outcomes. Correction for confounders did not affect the significance of these findings.--NEW SECTION--Maternal HIV infection in women who have not received antiretroviral therapy is associated with preterm birth, low birthweight, small for gestational age, and stillbirth, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

Its incidence continues to increase, especially within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which have limited capacity to address the growing need for treatment. The standard of care for lung cancer treatment often involves radiation therapy (RT), which plays an important therapeutic role in curative-intent treatment of early-stage to locally advanced disease, as well as in palliation. The infrastructure, equipment, and human resources required for RT may be limited in LMICs. However, this narrative review discusses the scope of the problem of lung cancer in LMICs, the role of RT technologies in lung cancer treatment, and RT capacity in developing countries. Strategies are presented for maximizing the availability and impact of RT in settings with minimal resource availability, and areas for potential future innovation are identified. Priorities for LMICs involve increasing access to RT equipment and trained health care professionals, ensuring quality of care, providing guidance on priority setting with limited resources, and encouraging innovation to increase the economic efficiency of RT delivery. Several international initiatives are currently under way and represent important first steps toward scaling up RT in LMICs to treat lung cancer.",eng,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Serological diagnosis of HBV mainly relies on the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Although there are high sensitivity commercial HBsAg enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) available, many low-resource laboratories lacking trained technicians continue to use rapid point-of-care assays with low sensitivities for HBsAg detection, due to their simplicity to operate. We developed a time-resolved fluorometric dry-reagent HBsAg immunoassay which meets the detection limit of high sensitivity EIAs but is simple to operate. To develop the assay, anti-HBsAg monoclonal antibody coated on europium nanoparticles was dried atop of biotinylated anti-HBsAg polyclonal antibody immobilized on streptavidin-coated microtiter wells. To test a sample in dry-reagent assay, serum sample and assay buffer were added to the wells, incubated, washed and europium signals were measured. The assay showed a detection limit of 0.25 ng/ml using HBsAg spiked in serum sample. When evaluated with 24 HBV positive and 37 negative serum samples, assay showed 100% sensitivity and specificity. Assay wells are stable for at least 26 weeks when stored at 4°C, and can tolerate elevated temperatures of up to 35°C for two weeks.

26762460,10.1038/nature16527,Intestinal epithelial tuft cells initiate type 2 mucosal immunity to helminth parasites.,"Helminth parasitic infections are a major global health and social burden. The host defence against helminths such as Nippostrongylus brasiliensis is orchestrated by type 2 cell-mediated immunity. Induction of type 2 cytokines, including interleukins (IL) IL-4 and IL-13, induce goblet cell hyperplasia with mucus production, ultimately resulting in worm expulsion. However, the mechanisms underlying the initiation of type 2 responses remain incompletely understood. Here we show that tuft cells, a rare epithelial cell type in the steady-state intestinal epithelium, are responsible for initiating type 2 responses to parasites by a cytokine-mediated cellular relay. Tuft cells have a Th2-related gene expression signature and we demonstrate that they undergo a rapid and extensive IL-4Rα-dependent amplification following infection with helminth parasites, owing to direct differentiation of epithelial crypt progenitor cells. We find that the Pou2f3 gene is essential for tuft cell specification. Pou2f3(-/-) mice lack intestinal tuft cells and have defective mucosal type 2 responses to helminth infection; goblet cell hyperplasia is abrogated and worm expulsion is compromised. Notably, IL-4Rα signalling is sufficient to induce expansion of the tuft cell lineage, and ectopic stimulation of this signalling cascade obviates the need for tuft cells in the epithelial cell remodelling of the intestine. Moreover, tuft cells secrete IL-25, thereby regulating type 2 immune responses. Our data reveal a novel function of intestinal epithelial tuft cells and demonstrate a cellular relay required for initiating mucosal type 2 immunity to helminth infection.",eng,Nature,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

There is still scarce information on the population structure of S. aureus strains in Asia, where the majority of the world population lives. This study characterized the diversity of S. aureus strains in northern Vietnam through multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Eighty-five carriage isolates from the community and 77 invasive isolates from the clinical setting were selected and tested for meticillin resistance and the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). MLST was performed on these isolates, of which CC59 (25.4 %), CC188 (17.3 %) and CC45 (16.7 %) were the predominant clonal complexes (CCs). CC59 carriage isolates had significantly lower rates of meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) than their corresponding clinical group isolates (32 vs 83 %). There were no significant differences in rates of MRSA between carriage isolates and clinical isolates of CC45 and CC188. CC59 carriage isolates were significantly lower in rates of PVL+ than CC59 clinical isolates (32 vs 83 %), but the converse was shown in CC45 isolates (14 vs 0 %, respectively). This study revealed vast differences in the molecular epidemiology and population structure of S. aureus in community and clinical settings in Vietnam.

26755562,10.4269/ajtmh.15-0553,Evaluation of a Structured Predeparture Orientation at the David Geffen School of Medicine's Global Health Education Programs.,"Given the lack of a standardized approach to medical student global health predeparture preparation, we evaluated an in-person, interactive predeparture orientation (PDO) at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) to understand program strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. We administered anonymous surveys to assess the structure and content of the PDO and also surveyed a subset of students after travel on the utility of the PDO. We used Fisher's exact test to evaluate the association between prior global health experience and satisfaction with the PDO. One hundred and five students attended the PDO between 2010 and 2014 and completed the survey. One hundred and four students (99.0%) reported learning new information. Major strengths included faculty mentorship (N = 38, 19.7%), opportunities to interact with the UCLA global health community (N = 34, 17.6%), and sharing global health experiences (N = 32, 16.6%). Of students surveyed after their elective, 94.4% (N = 51) agreed or strongly agreed that the PDO provided effective preparation. Students with prior global health experience found the PDO to be as useful as students without experience (92.7% versus 94.4%, P = 1.0). On the basis of these findings, we believe that a well-composed PDO is beneficial for students participating in global health experiences and recommend further comparative studies of PDO content and delivery.",eng,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26754815,10.1007/s00253-015-7210-0,Rapid drug susceptibility test of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using microscopic time-lapse imaging in an agarose matrix.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem, and multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) are spreading throughout the world. However, conventional drug susceptibility test (DST) methods, which rely on the detection of the colony formation on a solid medium, require 1-2 months to the result. A rapid and accurate DST is necessary to identify patients with drug-resistant TB and treat them with appropriate drugs. Here, we used microscopic imaging of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) immobilized in an agarose matrix for a rapid DST. The agarose matrix, which was molded in a microfluidic chip, was inoculated with MTB, and TB drugs in liquid culture medium diffused throughout the agarose to reach the MTB immobilized in the agarose matrix. After the responses of MTB to drugs were tracked with an automated microscopic system, an image-processing program automatically determined the susceptibility and resistance of MTB to specific doses of TB drugs. The automatic DST system was able to assess the drug susceptibility of various drug-resistant clinical TB strains within 9 days with an accuracy comparable to that of conventional method. Our rapid DST method based on microscopic time-lapse imaging greatly reduces the time required for a DST and can be used to rapidly and accurately treat TB patients.",eng,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In the West, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus are increasing in prevalence and impact. In the East, squamous esophageal cancer remains a large burden, but increasingly, precancerous lesions related to GERD are recognized. We review the various advanced endoscopic techniques that have been developed to improve the accuracy of endoscopic identification of esophageal disease. These techniques are designed to increase the sensitivity of detecting disease and high-risk lesions, enable targeted biopsies, decrease total number of biopsies and costs for surveillance, but also guide therapy in real-time. After proper clinical validation, the widespread use of these technologies will lead to improved outcomes, mostly in cancer prevention.",eng,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26752517,10.1038/nm.4023,"Killer lymphocytes use granulysin, perforin and granzymes to kill intracellular parasites.","Protozoan infections are a serious global health problem. Natural killer (NK) cells and cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) eliminate pathogen-infected cells by releasing cytolytic granule contents--granzyme (Gzm) proteases and the pore-forming perforin (PFN)--into the infected cell. However, these cytotoxic molecules do not kill intracellular parasites. CD8(+) CTLs protect against parasite infections in mice primarily by secreting interferon (IFN)-γ. However, human, but not rodent, cytotoxic granules contain the antimicrobial peptide granulysin (GNLY), which selectively destroys cholesterol-poor microbial membranes, and GNLY, PFN and Gzms rapidly kill intracellular bacteria. Here we show that GNLY delivers Gzms into three protozoan parasites (Trypanosoma cruzi, Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania major), in which the Gzms generate superoxide and inactivate oxidative defense enzymes to kill the parasite. PFN delivers GNLY and Gzms into infected cells, and GNLY then delivers Gzms to the intracellular parasites. Killer cell-mediated parasite death, which we term 'microbe-programmed cell death' or 'microptosis', is caspase independent but resembles mammalian apoptosis, causing mitochondrial swelling, transmembrane potential dissipation, membrane blebbing, phosphatidylserine exposure, DNA damage and chromatin condensation. GNLY-transgenic mice are protected against infection by T. cruzi and T. gondii, and survive infections that are lethal to wild-type mice. Thus, GNLY-, PFN- and Gzm-mediated elimination of intracellular protozoan parasites is an unappreciated immune defense mechanism.",eng,Nature medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This shift has gained urgency as resistance to artemisinin-combination therapies spreads in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) posing a threat to global health security. In the GMS, endemic malaria persists in forested border areas and elimination will require calibrated approaches to remove remaining pockets of residual infection. A new public health strategy called 'positive deviance' is being used to improve health promotion and community outreach in some of these zones. However, outbreaks sparked by alternative understandings of appropriate behaviour expose the unpredictable nature of 'border malaria' and difficulties eradication faces. Using a recent spike in infections allegedly linked to luxury timber trade in Thai borderlands, this article suggests that opportunities for market engagement can cause people to see 'deviance' as a means to material advancement in ways that increase disease vulnerability. A malaria outbreak in Ubon Ratchathani was investigated during two-week field-visit in November 2014 as part of longer project researching border malaria in Thai provinces. Qualitative data were collected in four villages in Ubon's three most-affected districts. Discussions with villagers focused primarily on changing livelihoods, experience with malaria, and rosewood cutting. Informants included ten men and two women who had recently overnighted in the nearby forest. Data from health officials and villagers are used to frame Ubon's rise in malaria transmission within moral and behavioural responses to expanding commodity supply-chains. The article argues that elimination strategies in the GMS must contend with volatile outbreaks among border populations wherein 'infectiousness' and 'resistance' are not simply pathogen characteristics but also behavioural dimensions born of insistent market aspirations.",eng,Social science & medicine (1982),Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A country-representative survey.,"This study investigated total sleep time in the Bangladeshi population and identified the proportion of the population at greater risk of developing chronic diseases due to inadequate sleep. Using a cross-sectional survey, total sleep time was captured and analysed in 3968 respondents aged between 6 and 106 years in 24 (of 64) districts in Bangladesh. Total sleep time was defined as the hours of total sleep in the previous 24 h. We used National Sleep Foundation (2015) guidelines to determine the recommended sleep hours in different age categories. Less or more than the recommended total sleep time (in hours) was considered 'shorter' and 'longer' sleep time, respectively. Linear and multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between demographic variables and estimated risk of shorter and longer total sleep time. The mean (±standard deviation) total sleep time of children (6-13 years), teenagers (14-17 years), young adults and adults (18-64 years) and older adults (≥65 years) were 8.6 (±1.1), 8.1 (±1.0), 7.7 (±0.9) and 7.8 (±1.4) h, respectively, which were significantly different (P < 0.01). More than half of school-age children (55%) slept less than, and 28.2% of older adults slept longer than, recommended. Residents in all divisions (except Chittagong) in Bangladesh were less likely to sleep longer than in the Dhaka division. Rural populations had a 3.96× greater chance of sleeping for a shorter time than urban residents. The Bangladeshi population tends to sleep for longer and/or shorter times than their respective recommended sleep hours, which is detrimental to health.",eng,Journal of sleep research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Increasingly, global health is being taught in medical schools, although its incorporation into an already full curriculum presents challenges. Global health was introduced into the MBChB curriculum at the University of Aberdeen through a student-selected component (SSC) as part of an existing medical humanities block. The Global Health and Humanities (GHH) module was first delivered in the autumn of 2013 and will shortly enter its third year.--NEW SECTION--This student-led study used quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the module's appropriateness and effectiveness for strengthening learning on global health, consisting of online surveys for course participants and semi-structured interviews with faculty members.--NEW SECTION--Integrating global health into the undergraduate medical curriculum by way of an SSC was regarded by teaching staff as an effective and realistic approach. A recognised strength of delivering global health as part of the medical humanities block was the opportunity to expose students to the social determinants of health through interdisciplinary teaching. Participating students all agreed that the learning approach strengthened both their knowledge of global health and a range of generic skills.--NEW SECTION--SSCs are, by definition, self-selecting, and will have a tendency to attract students already with an interest in a topic - here global health.

We therefore determined the maternal fatty acid (FA) profiles in metabolic organs after HFD administration during specific periods of gestation. Rats were fed a HFD for the first (HF1), second (HF2), or third (HF3) week, or for all three weeks (HFG) of gestation. Total maternal plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations were monitored throughout pregnancy. At day 20 of gestation, maternal plasma, liver, adipose tissue, and placenta FA profiles were determined. In HF3 mothers, plasma myristic and stearic acid concentrations were elevated, whereas docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was reduced in both HF3 and HFG mothers. In HF3 and HFG mothers, hepatic stearic and oleic acid proportions were elevated; conversely, DHA and linoleic acid (LA) proportions were reduced. In adipose tissue, myristic acid was elevated, whereas DHA and LA proportions were reduced in all mothers. Further, adipose tissue stearic acid proportions were elevated in HF2, HF3, and HFG mothers; with oleic acid increased in HF1 and HFG mothers. In HF3 and HFG mothers, placental neutral myristic acid proportions were elevated, whereas DHA was reduced. Further, placental phospholipid DHA proportions were reduced in HF3 and HFG mothers. Maintenance on a diet, high in saturated fat, but low in DHA and LA proportions, during late or throughout gestation, perpetuated reduced DHA across metabolic organs that adapt during pregnancy. Therefore a diet, with normal DHA proportions during gestation, may be important for balancing maternal FA status.",eng,Nutrients,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Haiti Air Ambulance is the first completely publicly-available helicopter ambulance service in a developing country. US standards were adopted for both aviation and aeromedical care in Haiti due to proximity and relationships. In order to implement properly, standards for aviation, critical care, and insurance reimbursement had to be put in place with local authorities. Haiti Air Ambulance worked with the Ministry of Health to author standards for medical procedures, medication usage, and staff training for aeromedical programs in the country. Utilisation criteria for the helicopter were drafted, edited, and constantly updated to ensure the program adapted to the clinical situation while maintaining US standard of care. During the first year, 76 patients were transferred; 13 of whom were children and 3 pregnant women. Three patients were intubated and two required bi-level mask ventilation. Traumatic injury and non-emergency interfacility transfers were the two most common indications for service. More than half of the transfers (54%) originated at one of six hospitals, mostly as a result of highly-involved staff. The program was limited by weather and the lack of weather reporting, radar, visual flight recognition, thus also causing an inability to fly at night.

Although the search for HCV treatments has resulted in great achievements, the current treatment methods have limitations, and new methods and drugs for hepatitis C treatment are still required. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of artesunate (ART) on HCV replication and compared these effects with those of ribavirin (RBV) and interferon-2b (IFN). The study was performed in HCV-infection cell models (JFH1-infected Huh7.5.1 and OR6 cell lines). Our results showed that the antimalarial drug ART inhibited HCV replicon replication in a dose- and time-dependent manner at a concentration that had no effect on the proliferation of exponentially growing host cells, and the inhibitory effect on HCV replication was stronger than RBV but weaker than IFN, as determined by qPCR, luciferase assays, and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the combination of ART and IFN resulted in a greater inhibition of HCV replication. These findings demonstrated that ART had an inhibitive effect on HCV replication and may be a novel supplemental co-therapy with IFN and RBV for HCV and as an alternative strategy to combat resistance mechanisms that have emerged in the presence of DAA agents.",eng,Virus genes,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) share a disproportionately high burden with 90% of the world's road traffic deaths, and where RTIs are escalating due to rapid urbanization and motorization. Although several studies have assessed the effectiveness of a specific intervention, no systematic reviews have been conducted summarizing the effectiveness of RTI prevention initiatives specifically performed in LMIC settings; this study will help fill this gap.--NEW SECTION--In accordance with PRISMA guidelines we searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, TRID, Lilacs, Scielo and Global Health. Articles were eligible if they considered RTI prevention in LMICs by evaluating a prevention-related intervention with outcome measures of crash, RTI, or death. In addition, a reference and citation analysis was conducted as well as a data quality assessment. A qualitative metasummary approach was used for data analysis and effect sizes were calculated to quantify the magnitude of emerging themes.--NEW SECTION--Of the 8560 articles from the literature search, 18 articles from 11 LMICs fit the eligibility and inclusion criteria. Of these studies, four were from Sub-Saharan Africa, ten from Latin America and the Caribbean, one from the Middle East, and three from Asia. Half of the studies focused specifically on legislation, while the others focused on speed control measures, educational interventions, enforcement, road improvement, community programs, or a multifaceted intervention.--NEW SECTION--Legislation was the most common intervention evaluated with the best outcomes when combined with strong enforcement initiatives or as part of a multifaceted approach. Because speed control is crucial to crash and injury prevention, road improvement interventions in LMIC settings should carefully consider how the impact of improvements will affect speed and traffic flow. Further road traffic injury prevention interventions should be performed in LMICs with patient-centered outcomes in order to guide injury prevention in these complex settings.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Both issues have gained increased international attention, but tobacco control has made more sustained progress in terms of international and domestic policy commitments, resources dedicated to reducing harm, and reduction of tobacco use in many high-income countries. The research presented here offers insights into why risk factors with comparable levels of harm experience different trajectories of global attention. The analysis focuses particular attention on the role of dedicated global health networks composed of individuals and organizations producing research and engaging in advocacy on a given health problem. Variation in issue characteristics and the policy environment shape the opportunities and challenges of global health networks focused on reducing the burden of disease. What sets the tobacco case apart was the ability of tobacco control advocates to create and maintain a consensus on policy solutions, expand their reach in low- and middle-income countries and combine evidence-based research with advocacy reaching beyond the public health-centered focus of the core network. In contrast, a similar network in the alcohol case struggled with expanding its reach and has yet to overcome divisions based on competing problem definitions and solutions to alcohol harm.

The search for novel anti-HCC agents is urgent. In the current study, we synthesized a liposomal C8 ceramide, and analyzed its anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical HCC models. The liposomal C8 (ceramide) potently inhibited HCC cell (HepG2, SMMC-7721 and Huh-7 lines) survival and proliferation, more efficiently than free C8 ceramide. Yet, non-cancerous HL7702 human hepatocytes were resistant to the liposomal C8 treatment. Liposomal C8 activated caspase-dependent apoptosis in HCC cells, and HCC cytotoxicity by liposomal C8 was significantly attenuated with co-treatment of caspase inhibitors. At the molecular level, we showed that liposomal C8 activated ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1)-JNK (Jun N-terminal protein kinase) signaling in HCC cells. On the other hand, JNK pharmacological inhibition or dominant negative mutation, as well as ASK1 shRNA-knockdown remarkably inhibited liposomal C8-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Further studies showed that liposomal C8 inhibited AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activation in HCC cells. Restoring AKT-mTOR activation by introducing a constitutively-active AKT alleviated HepG2 cytotoxicity by liposomal C8. In vivo, intravenous (i.v.) injection of liposomal C8 significantly inhibited HepG2 xenograft growth in severe combined immuno-deficient (SCID) mice, and mice survival was significantly improved. These preclinical results suggest that liposomal C8 could be further studied as a valuable anti-HCC agent.",eng,PloS one,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, due to heterogeneity in studies, the real estimate effect of comorbidities as modifiers of dengue severity could not be established. Further research in regions with high prevalence of dengue infection would contribute to a better understanding of the relevance of comorbidities in severe dengue, especially with a standardised protocol, for outcomes, specific comorbidities, study design-best using prospective designs-and sample sizes.",eng,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Prevention is highlighted as a priority to reduce its prevalence. Although effective preventive interventions exist, the efficacy and coverage can be improved. One proposed means to increase efficacy is by using interventions to target specific risk factors, such as rumination. Rumination-focused CBT (RFCBT) was developed to specifically target depressive rumination and reduces acute depressive symptoms and relapse for patients with residual depression in a randomised controlled trial. Preliminary findings from a Dutch randomised prevention trial in 251 high-risk 15- to 22-year-old subjects selected with elevated worry and rumination found that both supported internet-RFBCT and group-delivered RFCBT equally reduced depressive symptoms and the onset of depressive cases over a period of 1 year, relative to the no-intervention control.--NEW SECTION--A phase III randomised controlled trial following the Medical Research Council (MRC) Complex Interventions Framework will extend a Dutch trial to the United Kingdom, with the addition of diagnostic interviews, primarily to test whether guided internet-RFCBT reduces the onset of depression relative to a no-intervention control. High-risk young adults (aged 18 to 24 years), selected with elevated worry/rumination and recruited through university and internet advertisement, will be randomised to receive either guided internet-RFCBT, supported by clinical psychologists or mental health paraprofessionals, or a no-intervention control. As an adjunct arm, participants are also randomised to unguided internet-RFCBT self-help to provide an initial test of the feasibility and effect size of this intervention. While participants are also randomised to unguided internet-RFCBT, the trial was designed and powered as a phase III trial comparing guided internet-RFCBT versus a no-intervention control. In the comparison between these two arms, the primary outcomes are as follows: a) onset of major depressive episode over a 12-month period, assessed with a Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis at 3 months (post-intervention), 6 months and 15 months after randomisation. The following secondary outcomes will be recorded: the incidence of generalized anxiety disorder, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and levels of worry and rumination, measured at baseline and at the same follow-up intervals. In relation to the pilot investigation of unguided internet-RFCBT (the adjunct intervention arm), we will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the data-collection procedures, levels of attrition, effect size and acceptability of the unguided internet-RFCBT intervention.--NEW SECTION--Widespread implementation is necessary for effective prevention, suggesting that the internet may be a valuable mode of delivery. Previous research suggests that guided internet-RFCBT reduces incidence rates relative to controls. We are also interested in developing and evaluating an unguided version to potentially increase the availability and reduce the costs.--NEW SECTION--Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN12683436 .

The goal was to develop a tool to improve infection prevention and control through local capacity building within the context of an emergency response. The research showed that digital technology could be a powerful 'force multiplier' allowing much greater access to high fidelity training during an outbreak and keeping it current as protocols evolved or new safety critical steps were identified. Tailoring training to the local context was crucial to its relevance and accessibility. This initiative used a novel approach to the development of the training tool - ebuddi. It used agile development to co-create the tool with active participation of local communities. A further pilot showed how it could be extended to meet the longer term needs of triage training and ensure better quality assurance.

The coinage indicates that the spread of infectious disease transforms the spatial coordinates of the modern political environment. This article analyses this transformation by asking how the legal regime, designed to prepare for the pandemic, envisions the globe as an object of government. It demonstrates that the WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR) articulate a space of global circulation that exhibits two features. First, the infrastructures of microbial traffic become the primary matters of concern. The IHR do not focus on human life so much as they aim at securing transnational mobilities. Second, the IHR circumscribe a space that is fragmented by zones of intensified governmental control at transportational nodal points, such as airports and harbours. In these zones, technologies of screening and quarantine are applied to modulate the connectivity of people, organic matter and things. As a whole, the article investigates how processes of de- and re-territorialisation interact in the context of global health security. In analysing forms of legal worldmaking, it unearths a nomos of global circulation which applies its regulatory force to the post-human materialities of microbial traffic.",eng,Journal of international relations and development,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The framing of infectious disease as a threat to global public health and economic security coincides with preemptive forms of control. A particular type of preemptive regulation is global pandemic influenza planning that entails the governing of an imminent, albeit uncertain, global health event. We examine the discourse of 'preparedness' within pandemic planning documents produced by the World Health Organization from 1999 to 2009. We present key findings on: the construction of the influenza virus in terms of its potential to transform and expand across corporeal and territorial boundaries; and the integration of pandemic preparedness into everyday practices. Our analysis illustrates how the discourse of preparedness links the justification for population-level preemptive approaches to discursive constructions of the virus. By articulating this relationship, this article contributes to understandings of the implications of 'molecular' constructions for the biopolitical regulation of the global population.",eng,Social theory & health : STH,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

If the current trend continues, the burden of cancer will increase to 22 million new cases annually by 2030, with 81% of new cases and almost 88% of mortality occurring in less developed countries.--NEW SECTION--A qualitative review of the literature was conducted. This included a systematic search of eight electronic databases namely, PubMed, Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, Applied Social Sciences Index, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane and PsycINFO. The reference list of articles retrieved were also thoroughly searched. Inclusion criteria were studies that addressed global health, cancer disparities and global or economic development.--NEW SECTION--Thirty-one articles were identified that met the eligibility criteria. Results were synthesized in the form of a system dynamics causal loop diagram or map which led to identification of eight major stocks or system variables. These included, children and adult population, overall population health, pollution, quality of healthcare delivery, quality of neighborhood and built environment, social and community cohesiveness, healthy and social norms and attitudes, and literacy level. Based on this, a dynamic hypothesis of global health cancer disparities was developed. The causal loop diagram showed the role of multiple interacting feedback mechanisms as explanations for trends in global health cancer disparities and the underlying consequences.--NEW SECTION--Addressing these determinants of health requires an effective dynamic approach to improving global cancer health.

The number of the known carbapenemases is constantly increasing, however only four types are widely distributed: NDM-type, KPC-type, OXA-48-type and VIM-type. The frequency of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiellapneumoniae in hospitals of Saint Petersburg reached 9.2% (5.9% for NDM-type, 1.4% for OXA-48-type, 1.9% for NDM-type + OXA-48-type). Carbapenemase producers were also detected in hospitals of Moscow, Yekaterinburg, Vologda, Murmansk, Kurgan, Krasnoyarsk, Izhevsk, Krasnodar and Perm. In total 281 carbapenemase producers were recorded within 2011-2016, which were isolated from infected or colonized patients (K.pneumoniae - 247 isolates, Acinetobacter spp - 29 isolates, Enterobacter cloacae - 2 isolates, Serratia marcescens - 1 isolate, Escherichia coli - 1 isolate and Proteus mirabifis - 1 isolate). The carbapenemase-producing K.pneumoniae isolates were distinguished by considerable genetic diversity, the NDM-type carbapenemase-producers belonged to eight, KPC-type - to three and OXA-48-type - to four different sequence-types (STs) respectively. The representatives of the globally dominant genetic line, Clonal Group 258 (CG258), and also a number of the less common lines (ST147, ST273, ST307 and ST377) were detected. The K.pneumoniae strains were distinguished by a high frequency of cross-resistance and the associated resistance to antibiotics of different groups. The frequency of resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones reached 100%. Among the NDM-type carbapenemase producers the frequency of resistance to aminoglycosides exceeded 90%, among the KPC-type carbapenemase producers the frequency of resistance corresponded to 66% for amikacin and 93% for gentamicin, among the OXA-48 type carbapenemase producers the frequency of resistance was even lower (50% and 73% respectively). Approximately 80% of the NDM-type, 90% of the KPC-type and only 60% of the OXA-48-type carbapenemase producers showed a high level of resistance to imipenem and meropenem. The frequency of resistance to tigecycline varied within 6.7% to 14.8% and the frequency of resistance to polymyxin was within 4.2% to 20%. The OXA-40- and OXA-23-types carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter spp. remained susceptible only to polymyxin.

Many high risk elderly patients undergo cardiac surgery. In addition, advanced age has been shown to be a strong predictor of adverse neurological outcome. Despite sig- nificant improvements achieved in the perioperative care of cardiac surgical patients, neurological complications remain a global health issue. Recent findings have pointed out that cerebral hypoperfusion and too deep levels of anesthesia are major sources of adverse neurological outcomes. Cerebral near-in-frared spectroscopy provides information about cerebral perfusion non-invasively, and is increasingly used. Depth of anesthesia is evaluated using monitors that are based on processed electroencephalogram.

Voice handicap and QOL were assessed using the QOL questionnaires developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC); variables used were functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), global QOL scale (pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact, and sexuality), and the functional, physical, and emotional aspects of the voice handicap (one-way ANOVA test).--NEW SECTION--The mean age of the patients was 59.22 (standard deviation = 9.00) years. A total of 26 (40%) patients had moderate VHI (between 31 and 60) and 39 (60%) patients had severe VHI (higher than 61). Results of the HRQL questionnaires showed that patients who underwent speech therapy obtained better scores in most scales (P = 0.000). Patients with esophageal voice had a high score for functional scales compared with or without other voice rehabilitation methods (P = 0.07), and the VHI score for transesophageal prosthesis was improved after an adjustment period. The global health status and VHI scores showed a statistically significant correlation between speaker groups.--NEW SECTION--The EORTC and the VHI questionnaires offer more information regarding life after laryngectomy.",eng,Journal of research in medical sciences : the official journal of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
28327852,10.17843/rpmesp.2016.334.2567,[Person centered clinical care: principles and strategies].,"The development of person-centered clinical care is inscribed within an international programmatic movement towards a medicine focused on the totality of the person. This movement, with broad historical bases, has been maturing since 2008 through conferences among global health institutions, research projects and academic publications. This paper is aimed at elucidating the conceptual principles of person-centered medicine (PCM) and to delineate strategies for the practical application of such principles in clinical care services. The above objectives have been approached through literature reviews, international consultations, and reflections on the patterns and indications obtained. The principles identified for person-centered medicine are the following: Ethical commitment, holistic framework, cultural awareness and responsiveness, communication and relational focus, individualized clinical care, common ground among clinicians, patient and family for joint diagnostic understanding and shared decision making, person- and community-centered organization of integrated services, and person-centered medical education and research. Additionally, pertinent strategies have been delineated for the implementation of such principles in clinical care. The authors conclude that the presented principles and strategies are consistent with suggestions offered in the literature and may serve as bases for the design of indices and scales. Their continuous refinement is proposed through future international and local studies. to clarify the key concepts of the movement as well as strategies for their practical clinical application.",spa,Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,Case Reports,2025-04-23,2016

Screening for diabetic retinopathy has the potential to increase the number of cases treated early, especially in populations with limited access to care.--NEW SECTION--To determine the efficacy of an automated algorithm in interpreting screening ophthalmoscopic photographs from patients with diabetes compared with a reading center interpretation.--NEW SECTION--Retrospective cohort analysis of 15,015 patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes in the Harris Health System in Harris County, Texas, who had undergone a retinal screening examination and nonmydriatic fundus photography via the Intelligent Retinal Imaging System (IRIS) from June 2013 to April 2014 were included. The IRIS-based interpretations were compared with manual interpretation. The IRIS algorithm population statistics were calculated.--NEW SECTION--Sensitivity and false-negative rate of the IRIS computer-based algorithm compared with reading center interpretation of the same images.--NEW SECTION--A total of 15 015 consecutive patients (aged 18-98 years); mean 54.3 years with known type 1 or 2 diabetes underwent nonmydriatic fundus photography for a diabetic retinopathy screening examination. The sensitivity of the IRIS algorithm in detecting sight-threatening diabetic eye disease compared with the reading center interpretation was 66.4% (95% CI, 62.8%-69.9%) with a false-negative rate of 2%. The specificity was 72.8% (95% CI, 72.0%-73.5%). In a population where 15.8% of people with diabetes have sight-threatening diabetic eye disease, the IRIS algorithm positive predictive value was 10.8% (95% CI, 9.6%-11.9%) and the negative predictive value was 97.8% (95% CI, 96.8%-98.6%).--NEW SECTION--In this large urban setting, the IRIS computer algorithm-based screening program had a high sensitivity and a low false-negative rate, suggesting that it may be an effective alternative to conventional reading center image interpretation. The IRIS algorithm shows promise as a screening program, but algorithm refinement is needed to achieve better performance. Further studies of patient safety, cost-effectiveness, and widespread applications of this type of algorithm should be pursued to better understand the role of teleretinal imaging and automated analysis in the global health care system.",eng,JAMA ophthalmology,Evaluation Study,2025-04-23,2016

ICD-based injury severity measures can be empirically derived or mapped, but no single approach has been formally recommended. This study aimed to compare the performance of ICD-based injury severity measures to predict in-hospital mortality among injury-related admissions.--NEW SECTION--A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Global Health databases were searched from their inception through September 2014. Observational studies that assessed the performance of ICD-based injury severity measures to predict in-hospital mortality and reported discriminative ability using the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were included. Metrics of model performance were extracted. Pooled AUC were estimated under random-effects models.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-two eligible studies reported 72 assessments of discrimination on ICD-based injury severity measures. Reported AUC ranged from 0.681 to 0.958. Of the 72 assessments, 46 showed excellent (0.80 ≤ AUC < 0.90) and 6 outstanding (AUC ≥ 0.90) discriminative ability. Pooled AUC for ICD-based Injury Severity Score (ICISS) based on the product of traditional survival proportions was significantly higher than measures based on ICD mapped to Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores (0.863 vs. 0.825 for ICDMAP-ISS [p = 0.005] and ICDMAP-NISS [p = 0.016]). Similar results were observed when studies were stratified by the type of data used (trauma registry or hospital discharge) or the provenance of survival proportions (internally or externally derived). However, among studies published after 2003 the Trauma Mortality Prediction Model based on ICD-9 codes (TMPM-9) demonstrated superior discriminative ability than ICISS using the product of traditional survival proportions (0.850 vs. 0.802, p = 0.002). Models generally showed poor calibration.--NEW SECTION--ICISS using the product of traditional survival proportions and TMPM-9 predict mortality more accurately than those mapped to AIS codes and should be preferred for describing injury severity when ICD is used to record injury diagnoses.--NEW SECTION--Systematic review and meta-analysis, level III.",eng,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Highlighting common risk factors for CKD of uncertain etiology across various regions and populations may be important for health policy and public health responses.--NEW SECTION--We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science databases to identify published studies on CKDu. The search was generated in January of 2015; no language or date limits were used. We used a vote-counting method to evaluate exposures across all studies.--NEW SECTION--We identified 1607 articles, of which 26 met inclusion criteria. Eighteen (69%) were conducted in known CKDu-endemic countries: Sri Lanka (38%), Nicaragua (19%), and El Salvador (12%). The other studies were from India, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Sweden, Tunisia, Tanzania, and the United States. Heavy metals, heat stress, and dietary exposures were reported across all geographic regions. In south Asia, family history, agrochemical use, and heavy metal exposures were reported most frequently, whereas altitude and temperature were reported only in studies from Central America. Across all regions, CKDu was most frequently associated with a family history of CKDu, agricultural occupation, men, middle age, snake bite, and heavy metal exposure.--NEW SECTION--Studies examining etiologies of CKDu have reported many exposures that are heterogeneous and vary by region. To identify etiologies of CKDu, designing consistent and comparative multisite studies across high-risk populations may help elucidate the importance of region-specific versus global risk factors.",eng,Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The oral data extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study in 2010 (Murray et al, 2012) show that caries, periodontal disease, edentulism, oral cancer and cleft lip/palate collectively accounted for 18 814 000 disability-adjusted life-years; and the global burden of periodontal disease, oral cancer and caries increased markedly by an average of 45.6% from 1990 to 2010 in parallel with the major non-communicable diseases like diabetes by 69.0%. Oral diseases and non-communicable diseases are closely interlinked through sharing common risk factors (e.g. excess sugar consumption and tobacco use) and underlying infection/inflammatory pathways.--NEW SECTION--Oral disease remains a major public health burden worldwide. It is of great importance to integrate oral health into global health agenda via the common risk factor approach.

26704179,10.1093/heapol/czv122,BRICS countries and the global movement for universal health coverage.,"This article explores BRICS' engagement in the global movement for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the implications for global health governance. It is based on primary data collected from 43 key informant interviews, complemented by a review of BRICS' global commitments supporting UHC. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire that included both closed- and open-ended questions. Question development was informed by insights from the literature on UHC, Cox's framework for action, and Kingdon's multiple-stream theory of policy formation. The closed questions were analysed with simple descriptive statistics and the open-ended questions using grounded theory approach. The analysis demonstrates that most BRICS countries implicitly supported the global movement for UHC, and that they share an active engagement in promoting UHC. However, only Brazil, China and to some extent South Africa, were recognized as proactively pushing UHC in the global agenda. In addition, despite some concerted actions, BRICS countries seem to act more as individual countries rather that as an allied group. These findings suggest that BRICS are unlikely to be a unified political block that will transform global health governance. Yet the documented involvement of BRICS in the global movement supporting UHC, and their focus on domestic challenges, shows that BRICS individually are increasingly influential players in global health. So if BRICS countries should probably not be portrayed as the centre of future political community that will transform global health governance, their individual involvement in global health, and their documented concerted actions, may give greater voice to low- and middle-income countries supporting the emergence of multiple centres of powers in global health.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Social, economic, and political factors influence patients' burden of disease, access to treatment, and health outcomes. This challenge has motivated recent calls for increased attention to the social determinants of health. At the same time, advocates have called for increased attention to global health. Each year, more U.S. medical students participate in global health experiences. Yet, the global health training that is available varies widely. The discipline of social medicine, which attends to the social determinants of disease, social meanings of disease, and social responses to disease, offers a solution to both challenges. The analyses and techniques of social medicine provide an invaluable toolkit for providing health care in the United States and abroad.In 2007, Harvard Medical School implemented a new course, required for all first-year students, that teaches social medicine in a way that integrates global health. In this article, the authors argue for the importance of including social medicine and global health in the preclinical curriculum; describe Harvard Medical School's innovative, integrated approach to teaching these disciplines, which can be used at other medical schools; and explore the barriers that educators may face in implementing such a curriculum, including resistance from students.

De novo organ creation is one of the long-term goals of the medical community. One of the promising avenues is that of tissue engineering: the use of biomaterials to create cells, structures, or even whole organs. Tissue engineering has emerged from its nascent stage, with several proof-of-principle trials performed across various tissue types. As tissue engineering moves from the realm of case trials to broader clinical study, three major questions have emerged: (1) Can the production of biological scaffolds be scaled up accordingly to meet current and future demands without generating an unfavorable immune response? (2) Are biological scaffolds plus or minus the inclusion of cells replaced by scar tissue or native functional tissue? (3) Can tissue-engineered organs be grown in children and adolescents given the different immune profiles of children?

As the lytic action of bacteriophages is unaffected by the antibiotic resistance status of their bacterial target, it is thought that phage therapy may have considerable potential in the treatment of a wide range of topical and localized infections. As yet this interest has not extended to intravenous (IV) use, which is surprising given that the historical record shows that phages are likely to be safe and effective when delivered by this route. Starting almost 100 years ago, phages were administered intravenously in treatment of systemic infections including typhoid, and Staphylococcal bacteremia. There was extensive IV use of phages in the 1940s to treat typhoid, reportedly with outstanding efficacy and safety. The safety of IV phage administration is also underpinned by the detailed work of Ochs and colleagues in Seattle who have over four decades' experience with IV injection into human subjects of large doses of highly purified coliphage PhiX174. Though these subjects included a large number of immune-deficient children, no serious side effects were observed over this extended time period. The large and continuing global health problems of typhoid and Staphylococcus aureus are exacerbated by the increasing antibiotic resistance of these pathogens. We contend that these infections are excellent candidates for use of IV phage therapy.",eng,FEMS microbiology letters,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Providing nearby access to safe drinking water is a primary public health concern and a frequent public health intervention throughout sub-Saharan Africa; access to water eliminates long gathering and transport time and provides an individual with more personal time. Previous research has not reviewed the aspect of time and relationship changes after implemented water interventions.--NEW SECTION--A qualitative phenomenological approach used 52 semistructured interviews to examine relationship experiences among primary water gatherers and their families after receiving nearby access to water. This study took place throughout the historically semiarid eastern region in Kitui, Kenya, where community members have been beneficiaries of various water interventions.--NEW SECTION--Before the water intervention, family members experienced difficulties with irregular meal times and food availability, infrequent family conversations, irritation with lack of bathing and cleanliness, and general discontent without the availability of 1 able-bodied family member. Participants' experiences after implemented water interventions revealed enhanced relationships within household family units; additional personal time was gained and used to rebuild relationships. The newly established relationships included constructive discussions and conversations built around understanding and developing solutions to address economic or individual challenges encountered by the family.--NEW SECTION--This study's findings suggest that relationships significantly improved after households receive access to nearby water.

The association between depression and telomere length was significant, with a Cohen's d effect size of -0.205 (p<0.0001, I(2)=42%). Depression severity significantly associated with telomere length (p=0.03). Trim and fill analysis indicated the presence of publication bias (p=0.003), but that the association remained highly significant after accounting for the bias. Subgroup analysis revealed depression assessment tools, telomere measurement techniques, source tissue and comorbid medical conditions significantly affected the relationship.--NEW SECTION--Other potentially important sub-groups, including antidepressant use, have not been investigated in sufficient detail or number yet and thus were not addressed in this meta-analysis.--NEW SECTION--There is a negative association between depression and telomere length. Further studies are needed to clarify potential causality underlying this association and to elucidate the biology linking depression and this cellular marker of stress exposure and aging.",eng,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This current statement updates the Collegium's earlier statements with a focus on global health dimensions of asbestos and asbestos-related diseases (ARD). The ARD epidemic will likely not peak for at least a decade in most industrialized countries and for several decades in industrializing countries. Asbestos and ARD will continue to present challenges in the arena of occupational medicine and public health, as well as in clinical research and practice, and have thus emerged as a global health issue. Industrialized countries that have already gone through the transition to an asbestos ban have learned lessons and acquired know-how and capacity that could be of great value if deployed in industrializing countries embarking on the transition. The accumulated wealth of experience and technologies in industrialized countries should thus be shared internationally through global campaigns to eliminate ARD.",eng,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26686330,10.1111/bioe.12224,Humanity and Justice in Global Health: Problems with Venkatapuram's Justification of the Global Health Duty.,"One of the most ambitious and sophisticated recent approaches to provide a theory of global health justice is Sridhar Venkatapuram's recent work. In this commentary, we first outline the core idea of Venkatapuram's approach to global health justice. We then argue that one of the most important elements of the account, Venkatapuram's basis of global health duties, is either too weak or assumed implicitly without a robust justification. The more explicit grounding of the duty to protect and promote health capabilities is based on Martha Nussbaum's version of the capability approach. We argue that this foundation gives rise to humanitarian duties rather than duties of justice proper. Venkatapuram's second argument from the social determinants of health thesis is instead a stronger candidate for grounding duties of justice. However, as a justificatory argument, it is only alluded to and has not yet been spelled out sufficiently. We offer plausible justificatory steps to fill this gap and draw some implications for global health action. We believe this both strengthens Venkatapuram's approach and serves to broaden the basis for future action in the area of global health.",eng,Bioethics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We report a case of meningitis caused by NDM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, for which intrathecal administration of colistin was curative. A previously healthy 38-year-old Japanese man, who lived in Hyderabad, India, suddenly collapsed and was brought to a local hospital. He was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage and underwent emergency surgery which included partial skull removal. Approximately 1 month after surgery, he was repatriated to Japan and was admitted to our institution with information that he had been treated for multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter infection with colistin. A week after admission, he developed aspiration pneumonia due to NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae, which was successfully treated by intravenous (IV) administration of colistin. Subsequently, he underwent a surgical procedure to repair his skull defect. He developed high-grade fever and altered mental status on postoperative day 2. NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae was identified in the cerebrospinal fluid, establishing the diagnosis of meningitis. Although IV colistin was only partially effective, intrathecal colistin (10 mg daily by lumbar puncture for 14 days) successfully eradicated the meningitis. Because of economic globalization, NDM-1-producing bacteria may be brought to Japan by those who are repatriated after sustaining critical illnesses and being treated in foreign countries. This report may provide useful information on the treatment of central nervous system infection by NDM-1-producing bacteria.",eng,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,Case Reports,2025-04-23,2016

Cox regression model was used for both univariate and multivariate analyses of OS.--NEW SECTION--Global health status (GH) dimension score at baseline was associated with favourable OS when adjusted for clinical, functional, and histological factors (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.986; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.980-0.992). We distinguished three groups according to GH score: high (GH <46), intermediate (46 ≤ GH ≤ 67), and low (GH >67) mortality risk. The median OS values were 14.5, 8.2, and 5.3 months in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories, respectively (log-rank P <0.0001). In the high-risk group, doublet chemotherapy was not associated with favourable OS (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.49-1.003; P=0.052), whereas in the intermediate- and low-risk groups, doublet chemotherapy was associated with favourable OS (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.54-0.96; P=0.023 and HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.30-0.84; P=0.0089, respectively).--NEW SECTION--This study supports the additional prognostic value of HRQoL data at diagnosis to identify vulnerable subpopulations in elderly NSCLC patients.

26681206,10.1071/AH15162,Contribution of mobile health applications to self-management by consumers: review of published evidence.,"Objective The aim of the present study was to review the contribution of mobile health applications ('apps') to consumers' self-management of chronic health conditions, and the potential for this practice to inform health policy, procedures and guidelines. Methods A search was performed on the MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, ProQuest and Global Health (Ovid) databases using the search terms 'mobile app*', 'self-care', 'self-monitoring', 'trial', 'intervention*' and various medical conditions. The search was supplemented with manual location of emerging literature and government reports. Mapping review methods identified relevant titles and abstracts, followed by review of content to determine extant research, reports addressing the key questions, and gaps suggesting areas for future research. Available studies were organised by disease state, and presented in a narrative analysis. Results Four studies describing the results of clinical trials were identified from Canada, England, Taiwan and Australia; all but the Australian study used custom-made apps. The available studies examined the effect of apps in health monitoring, reporting positive but not robust findings. Australian public policy and government reports acknowledge and support self-management, but do not address the potential contribution of mobile interventions. Conclusions There are limited controlled trials testing the contribution of health apps to consumers' self-management. Further evidence in this field is required to inform health policy and practice relating to self-management. What is known about the topic? Australian health policy encourages self-care by health consumers to reduce expenditure in health services. A fundamental component of self-care in chronic health conditions is self-monitoring, which can be used to assess progress towards treatment goals, as well as signs and symptoms of disease exacerbation. An abundance of mobile health apps is available for self-monitoring. What does this study add? A limited number of randomised control trials have assessed the clinical impact of health apps for self-monitoring. The body of evidence relating to current and long-term clinical impact is developing. Despite endorsing self-care, Australian health policy does not address the use and potential contribution of mobile health apps to health care. What are the implications? Widespread and sustained use of validated mobile health apps for chronic health conditions should have potential to improve consumer independence, confidence and burden on health services in the longer term. However, a significant body of scientific evidence has not yet been established; this is mirrored in the lack of acknowledgement of health apps in Australian health policy referring to consumers' self-management.",eng,Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A recent progress review of the Global Vaccine Action Plan stated that ""countries should urgently identify barriers and bottlenecks and implement targeted approaches to increase and sustain coverage"". However, vaccination coverage may be determined by a complex mix of demographic, structural, social and behavioral factors. To develop a practical taxonomy to organise the myriad possible root causes of a gap in vaccination coverage rates, we performed a narrative review of the literature and tested whether all non-socio-demographic determinants of coverage could be organised into 4 dimensions: Access, Affordability, Awareness and Acceptance. Forty-three studies were reviewed, from which we identified 23 primary determinants of vaccination uptake. We identified a fifth domain, Activation, which captured interventions such as SMS reminders which effectively nudge people towards getting vaccinated. The 5As taxonomy captured all identified determinants of vaccine uptake. This intuitive taxonomy has already facilitated mutual understanding of the primary determinants of suboptimal coverage within inter-sectorial working groups, a first step towards them developing targeted and effective solutions.",eng,Vaccine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Previous studies have suggested that the interleukin 28B (IL28B) rs8099917 genotype is related to spontaneous clearance of HCV in Caucasian populations. Our objective was to investigate the association of the IL28B rs8099917 genotype with spontaneous clearance of HCV by community-dwelling Japanese. A cross-sectional community-based population study of 993 Japanese residents was conducted. Based on anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA levels, 50 subjects were assigned to the spontaneous-clearance group, 155 to the chronic-infection group, and 788 to the control group.

Laboratory research has focused on individual waterpipe users while group use is common. This study examined user toxicant exposure and smoke toxicant yield associated with individual and group waterpipe smoking.--NEW SECTION--Twenty-two pairs of waterpipe smokers used a waterpipe individually and as a dyad. Before and after smoking, blood was sampled and expired carbon monoxide (CO) measured; puff topography was recorded throughout. One participant from each pair was selected randomly and their plasma nicotine and expired air CO concentrations were compared when smoking alone to when smoking as part of a dyad. Recorded puff topography was used to machine-produce smoke that was analyzed for toxicant content.--NEW SECTION--There was no difference in mean plasma nicotine concentration when an individual smoked as part of a dyad (mean = 14.9 ng/ml; standard error of the mean [SEM] = 3.0) compared to when smoking alone (mean = 10.0 ng/ml; SEM = 1.5). An individual smoking as part of as a dyad had, on average, lower CO (mean = 15.8 ppm; SEM = 2.0) compared to when smoking alone (mean= 21.3 ppm; SEM = 2.7). When two participants smoked as a dyad they took, on average, more puffs (mean = 109.8; SEM = 7.6) than a singleton smoker (mean = 77.7; SEM = 8.1) and a shorter interpuff interval (IPI; dyad mean = 23.8 seconds; SEM = 1.9; singleton mean = 40.8 seconds; SEM = 4.8). Higher concentrations of several toxicants were observed in dyad-produced smoke.--NEW SECTION--Dyad smoking may increase smoke toxicant content, likely due to the dyad's shorter IPIs and greater puff number. More work is needed to understand if group waterpipe smoking alters the health risks of waterpipe tobacco smoking.--NEW SECTION--This study is the first to measure toxicants in smoke generated from a waterpipe when used by a dyad. Relative to smoke generated by a singleton, dyad smoke had higher concentration of some toxicants. These differences may be attributed to differences in puffing behavior, specifically the shorter IPI and greater puff number observed in the dyad condition. Relative to singleton smokers, dyad smokers were exposed to less CO, but nicotine exposure did not differ. More work is needed to assess the health effects of inhalation of more toxicant-laden smoke during group waterpipe use.",eng,Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

There have been no major advances for the treatment of UBC in the last 30 years. In this study, we attempted to discover novel candidate therapeutic biomarkers for UBC. We utilized a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS-based proteomic method to compare and identify differentially expressed proteins in UBC and adjacent normal tissues. Thirty five differentially expressed proteins (over 2-fold, p<0.05) were identified. Further cluster analysis revealed these proteins were mainly involved in metabolism, apoptosis regulation, calcium ion binding and so on. Among them, phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), significantly up-regulated in UBC, was selected for detailed analysis. Immunohistochemical data showed that increased expression of PGAM1 was correlated with the severity of histological grade. Knockdown of PGAM1 expression by RNAi contributed to a marked antitumor activity in vivo. Moreover, we found, upon attenuation of PGAM1, its substrate 3-PG (3-phosphoglycerate) was up-regulated and product 2-PG (2-phosphoglycerate) was down-regulated, which consequently inhibited aerobic glycolysis and oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that are essential to cancer cell proliferation.

This phase III trial prospectively assessed whether continued irreversible ErbB-family blockade with afatinib plus paclitaxel has superior outcomes versus switching to chemotherapy alone in patients acquiring resistance to erlotinib/gefitinib and afatinib monotherapy.--NEW SECTION--Patients with relapsed/refractory disease following ≥1 line of chemotherapy, and whose tumors had progressed following initial disease control (≥12 weeks) with erlotinib/gefitinib and thereafter afatinib (50 mg/day), were randomized 2:1 to receive afatinib plus paclitaxel (40 mg/day; 80 mg/m(2)/week) or investigator's choice of single-agent chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Other end points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), safety and patient-reported outcomes.--NEW SECTION--Two hundred and two patients with progressive disease following clinical benefit from afatinib were randomized to afatinib plus paclitaxel (n = 134) or single-agent chemotherapy (n = 68). PFS (median 5.6 versus 2.8 months, hazard ratio 0.60, P = 0.003) and ORR (32.1% versus 13.2%, P = 0.005) significantly improved with afatinib plus paclitaxel. There was no difference in OS. Global health status/quality of life was maintained with afatinib plus paclitaxel over the entire treatment period. The median treatment duration was 133 and 51 days with afatinib plus paclitaxel and single-agent chemotherapy, respectively; 48.5% of patients receiving afatinib plus paclitaxel and 30.0% of patients receiving single-agent chemotherapy experienced drug-related grade 3/4 adverse events.

As a core method field in population health science and medicine, epidemiology is a growing scientific discipline that can analyze disease risk factors and develop statistical methodologies to maximize utilization of big data on populations and disease pathology. The evolving transdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) can advance biomedical and health research by linking exposures to molecular pathologic signatures, enhancing causal inference and identifying potential biomarkers for clinical impact. The MPE approach can be applied to any diseases, although it has been most commonly used in neoplastic diseases (including breast, lung and colorectal cancers) because of availability of various molecular diagnostic tests. However, use of state-of-the-art genomic, epigenomic and other omic technologies and expensive drugs in modern healthcare systems increases racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. To address this, we propose to integrate molecular pathology, epidemiology and social science. Social epidemiology integrates the latter two fields. The integrative social MPE model can embrace sociology, economics and precision medicine, address global health disparities and inequalities, and elucidate biological effects of social environments, behaviors and networks. We foresee advancements of molecular medicine, including molecular diagnostics, biomedical imaging and targeted therapeutics, which should benefit individuals in a global population, by means of an interdisciplinary approach of integrative MPE and social health science.",eng,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Almost two-thirds of matriculating medical students expect to participate in a global health experience during medical school, continuing into residency and early careers. Despite positive intent, such short-term experiences in global health (STEGHs) may exacerbate global health inequities and even cause harm. Growing out of the ""medical missions"" tradition, contemporary participation continues to evolve. Ethical concerns and other disciplinary approaches, such as public health and anthropology, can be incorpo rated to increase effectiveness and sustainability, and to shift the culture of STEGHs from focusing on trainees and their home institutions to also considering benefits in host communities and nurtur ing partnerships. The authors propose four core principles to guide ethical development of educational STEGHs: (1) skills building in cross-cultural effective ness and cultural humility, (2) bidirectional participatory relationships, (3) local capacity building, and (4) long-term sustainability. Application of these principles highlights the need for assessment of STEGHs: data collection that allows transparent compar isons, standards of quality, bidirectionality of agreements, defined curricula, and ethics that meet both host and sending countries' standards and needs. To capture the enormous potential of STEGHs, a paradigm shift in the culture of STEGHs is needed to ensure that these experiences balance training level, personal competencies, medical and cross-cultural ethics, and educational objectives to minimize harm and maximize benefits for all involved.",eng,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, the types and sources of particles most responsible are not yet known.--NEW SECTION--We sought to identify the causal characteristics and sources of air pollution underlying past associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality, as established in the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study-II cohort.--NEW SECTION--Individual risk factor data were evaluated for 445,860 adults in 100 U.S. metropolitan areas followed from 1982 through 2004 for vital status and cause of death. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated IHD mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for PM2.5, trace constituents, and pollution source-associated PM2.5, as derived from air monitoring at central stations throughout the nation during 2000-2005.--NEW SECTION--Associations with IHD mortality varied by PM2.5 mass constituent and source. A coal combustion PM2.5 IHD HR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.08) per microgram/cubic meter, versus an IHD HR = 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.02) per microgram/cubic meter PM2.5 mass, indicated a risk roughly five times higher for coal combustion PM2.5 than for PM2.5 mass in general, on a per microgram/cubic meter PM2.5 basis. Diesel traffic-related elemental carbon (EC) soot was also associated with IHD mortality (HR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.06 per 0.26-μg/m3 EC increase). However, PM2.5 from both wind-blown soil and biomass combustion was not associated with IHD mortality.--NEW SECTION--Long-term PM2.5 exposures from fossil fuel combustion, especially coal burning but also from diesel traffic, were associated with increases in IHD mortality in this nationwide population. Results suggest that PM2.5-mortality associations can vary greatly by source, and that the largest IHD health benefits per microgram/cubic meter from PM2.5 air pollution control may be achieved via reductions of fossil fuel combustion exposures, especially from coal-burning sources.--NEW SECTION--Thurston GD, Burnett RT, Turner MC, Shi Y, Krewski D, Lall R, Ito K, Jerrett M, Gapstur SM, Diver WR, Pope CA III. 2016.

Pseudoginsenoside-F11 (PF11) is an ocotillol-type saponin that is isolated from Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) and was shown to have neuroprotective effects to promote learning and memory and to antagonize the pharmacological effects of morphine. Furthermore, PF11 also shows protective effects against METH-induced neurotoxicity in mice. However, the effects of PF11 on METH-induced preference and dopamine (DA) release have not been defined.--NEW SECTION--We investigated the effects of PF11 administration on METH-induced hyperlocomotion and conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice. Subsequently, extracellular DA and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were determined in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice after co-administration of PF11 and METH using in vivo microdialysis analyses. Moreover, the effects of PF11 administration on the μ-opioid neuronal responses, DAMGO (μ-opioid receptor agonist; [D-Ala(2), N-MePhe(4), Gly-ol]-enkephalin)-induced hyperlocomotion and accumbal extracellular DA increase were investigated to elucidate how PF11 inhibits METH-induced dependence by dopaminergic neuronal hyperfunction.--NEW SECTION--Co-administration of PF11 and METH for 6 days attenuated METH-induced locomotor sensitization compared with treatment with METH alone. In the CPP test, PF11 administration also inhibited METH-induced place preference. In vivo microdialysis analyses indicated that co-administration of PF11 and METH for 7 days prevented METH-induced extracellular DA increase in the NAc and repeated PF11 administration with or without METH for 7 days increased extracellular GABA levels in the NAc, whereas single administration of PF11 did not. Furthermore, DAMGO-induced hyperlocomotion and accumbal extracellular DA increase were significantly inhibited by acute PF11 administration.--NEW SECTION--The present data suggest that PF11 inhibits METH-induced hyperlocomotion, preference, and accumbal extracellular DA increase by regulating GABAergic neurons and μ-opioid receptors.",eng,Psychopharmacology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Airway inflammation was assessed with the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and participants exhaled at various exhalation flows to determine alveolar and bronchial NO.--NEW SECTION--In total 34 subjects were enrolled in the study; 19 subjects had a normal BMI (18.50-24.99), whilst 15 subjects were overweight (BMI 25.00-29.99), or obese (BMI ≥30). All subjects had normal spirometry. However, IOS measures of airway resistance (R) at 5Hz, 20Hz and frequency dependence (R5-20) were elevated in overweight/obese individuals, compared to subjects with a normal BMI (median (interquartile range)); 5Hz: 0.41 (0.37, 0.45) vs. 0.32 (0.30, 0.37)kPa/l/s; 20Hz: 0.34 (0.30, 0.37) vs. 0.30 (0.26, 0.33)kPa/l/s; R5-20: 0.06 (0.04, 0.11) vs. 0.03 (0.01, 0.05)kPa/l/s; p<0.05), whereas airway reactance at 20Hz was decreased in overweight/obese individuals (20Hz: 0.07 (0.03, 0.09) vs. 0.10 (0.07, 0.13)kPa/l/s, p=0.009; 5Hz: -0.12 (-0.15, -0.10) vs. -0.10 (-0.13, -0.09)kPa/l/s, p=0.07).

Nanotechnology offers enormous potential in medicine, yet there is limited knowledge regarding the toxicity of nanoparticles (NP) for mycobacterial species that cause serious human diseases (e.g. tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy). Mycobacterial diseases are a major global health problem; TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) kills up to 2 million people annually and there are over 200 000 leprosy cases each year caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae). Few drugs are effective against these mycobacteria and increasing antibiotic resistance exacerbates the problem. As such, alternative therapies are urgently needed but most current assays used to assess the effectiveness of therapeutics against mycobacteria are slow and expensive. This study aimed to develop a rapid, low-cost assay which can be used for screening the antimicrobial properties of compounds against pathogenic mycobacteria and to assess the toxicity of three NP (silver [Ag], copper oxide [Cu(II)O], and zinc oxide [ZnO]) against a green fluorescent protein reporter strain of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, a slow growing, pathogenic mycobacterial species causing paratuberculosis in ruminants. Fluorescence was used to monitor mycobacterial growth over time, with NP concentrations of 6.25-100 μg/mL tested for up to 7 days, and a method of data analysis was designed to permit comparison between results.

Herein, we present a study of the immuno-potentiating mechanisms of YIC revealed by live-cell imaging technology. We studied internalization and dissociation of YIC in cells in vitro, and antigen presentation and T cell stimulation in mice. We found that after YIC was internalized via the Fcγ receptors (FcγR) of antigen presenting cells, it was subsequently transferred through early and late endosomal into lysosomal compartments. The dissociation of YIC was mainly observed in the late endosome. Furthermore when YIC were injected into mice, the populations of IFN-γ- and TNF-α-producing CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were higher in the YIC group than in controls receiving antigen or antibody alone.

This study sought to examine the hypothesis that reductions in fatigue after anti-TNF therapy reflect changes in central, not peripheral, pain mechanisms.--NEW SECTION--Data came from patients with severe baseline fatigue (Short Form 36 health survey [SF-36] vitality scale ≤12.5; n = 2,652), recruited to the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for RA for commencing anti-TNF therapies between October 2000 and November 2008. Data of interest comprised change over 6 months in fatigue, pain (SF-36 bodily pain scale), and disease activity constituents (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], global health, swollen joints, and tender joints). Principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation determined latent variables of symptom change; variables were accepted provided they had eigenvalues ≥1.--NEW SECTION--Six factors were identified, of which 2 met acceptance criteria (eigenvalues of 2.39 and 1.14, respectively). Following rotation, loadings indicated that factor 1 comprised markers of peripheral inflammation: change in ESR, swollen joints, tender joints, and global health. This distinct loading led to factor 1 being labeled peripheral inflammation. Conversely, factor 2 comprised change in pain, fatigue, and global health and an absence of peripheral inflammation markers and was therefore labeled central inflammation.--NEW SECTION--Following anti-TNF therapies, reductions in fatigue and pain appear to reflect improvements in central, rather than peripheral, inflammation. Therefore, for those seeking to treat fatigue via pain mechanisms, improvements may be maximized by the application of treatment modalities that effectively target central mechanisms.",eng,Arthritis care & research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

To enable assessment of healthcare value in stroke management, an international standard set of patient-centered stroke outcome measures was defined for use in a variety of healthcare settings.--NEW SECTION--A modified Delphi process was implemented with an international expert panel representing patients, advocates, and clinical specialists in stroke outcomes, stroke registers, global health, epidemiology, and rehabilitation to reach consensus on the preferred outcome measures, included populations, and baseline risk adjustment variables.--NEW SECTION--Patients presenting to a hospital with ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage were selected as the target population for these recommendations, with the inclusion of transient ischemic attacks optional. Outcome categories recommended for assessment were survival and disease control, acute complications, and patient-reported outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes proposed for assessment at 90 days were pain, mood, feeding, selfcare, mobility, communication, cognitive functioning, social participation, ability to return to usual activities, and health-related quality of life, with mobility, feeding, selfcare, and communication also collected at discharge. One instrument was able to collect most patient-reported subdomains (9/16, 56%). Minimum data collection for risk adjustment included patient demographics, premorbid functioning, stroke type and severity, vascular and systemic risk factors, and specific treatment/care-related factors.--NEW SECTION--A consensus stroke measure Standard Set was developed as a simple, pragmatic method to increase the value of stroke care. The set should be validated in practice when used for monitoring and comparisons across different care settings.",eng,Stroke,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26603918,10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00474-2,Access to effective antimicrobials: a worldwide challenge.,"Recent years have seen substantial improvements in life expectancy and access to antimicrobials, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, but increasing pathogen resistance to antimicrobials threatens to roll back this progress. Resistant organisms in health-care and community settings pose a threat to survival rates from serious infections, including neonatal sepsis and health-care-associated infections, and limit the potential health benefits from surgeries, transplants, and cancer treatment. The challenge of simultaneously expanding appropriate access to antimicrobials, while restricting inappropriate access, particularly to expensive, newer generation antimicrobials, is unique in global health and requires new approaches to financing and delivering health care and a one-health perspective on the connections between pathogen transmission in animals and humans. Here, we describe the importance of effective antimicrobials. We assess the disease burden caused by limited access to antimicrobials, attributable to resistance to antimicrobials, and the potential effect of vaccines in restricting the need for antibiotics.",eng,"Lancet (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Most women (91.5%) in the studies had pre-eclampsia. Baseline serum magnesium concentrations were consistently <1 mmol/l across studies. Intravenous loading dose between 4 and 6 g was associated with a doubling of this baseline concentration half an hour after injection. Maintenance infusion of 1 g/hour consistently produced concentrations well below 2 mmol/l, whereas maintenance infusion at 2 g/hour and the Pritchard intramuscular regimen had higher but inconsistent probability of producing concentrations between 2 and 3 mmol/l. Volume of distribution of magnesium varied (13.65-49.00 l) but the plasma clearance was fairly similar (4.28-5.00 l/hour) across populations.--NEW SECTION--The profiles of Zuspan and Pritchard regimens indicate that the minimum effective serum magnesium concentration for eclampsia prophylaxis is lower than the generally accepted level. Exposure-response studies to identify effective alternative dosing regimens should target concentrations achievable by these standard regimens.--NEW SECTION--Minimum effective serum magnesium concentration for eclampsia prophylaxis is lower than the generally accepted therapeutic level.",eng,BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

(31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allows non-invasive probing of important liver metabolites. Recently, the adiabatic multi-echo spectroscopic imaging sequence with spherical k-space sampling (AMESING) was introduced at 7T, enabling acquisition of T2 information. T2-weighed averaging of the multiple echoes improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The purpose of our study was to implement AMESING MRSI of the liver at 3T and 7T, derive localized T2 information and compare T2-weighted average spectra in terms of SNR.--NEW SECTION--Ten male volunteers underwent 2D AMESING MRSI at 3T and 7T after a minimum four-hour fast. SNR was calculated for PC, PE, Pi, GPE, GPC and α-ATP using maximum peak amplitudes and the SD of the noise. Metabolite peak ratios were calculated after fitting in jMRUI. SNR values and peak ratios were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.--NEW SECTION--For the first time liver metabolites' T2 values at 7T were measured: PE (55.6±3.5 ms), PC (51.2±2.3 ms), Pi (46.4±1.1 ms), GPE (44.0±0.8 ms), GPC (50.4±0.8 ms) and α-ATP (18.2±0.4 ms). SNR gain using T2-weighted averaging at 7T resulted in a 1.2× SNR gain. In conjunction with higher field strength and improved coil set-up T2-weighted averaging at 7T allowed a total 3.2× SNR gain compared to 3T FID-only.--NEW SECTION--AMESING 2D MRSI of the liver at 7T provides T2 values that allow T2-weighted averaging of data from multiple echoes resulting in improved SNR.",eng,Magnetic resonance imaging,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

It is reported as the reason for 1-4% of all hospital admissions in developed countries. The prognosis in HF remains unfavourable. Having at our disposal a large group of patients with systolic HF at a high-volume reference cardiovascular centre with the possibility to implement complete diagnostics and therapy we decided to analyse the clinical data, administered therapies, and prognosis in HF patients.--NEW SECTION--The COMMIT-HF is a single-centre observational study that is underway in the Third Chair and Department of Cardiology of the Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases in Zabrze. The study population is a cohort of adult HF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%. Patients with acute coronary syndromes are excluded from the analysis. Complete patient demographics: medical history, hospitalisation data (diagnostic and therapeutic), and in-hospital results are collected. Twelve-month follow-up is based on the information acquired from the national health-care provider.--NEW SECTION--As of 31 December 2013 a group of 1798 patients have been enrolled (mean age 60.9 ± 12.8 years, 20.3% of subjects female, mean LVEF 26.06 ± 6.09, ischaemic aetiology 64.5%, atrial fibrillation 33.2%, diabetes mellitus 41.2%, chronic kidney disease stage ≥ III 29%).

In spite of commendable research on Indian BIG FOUR venomous species; Naja naja and Bungarus caeruleus (elapid); Daboia russelii and Echis carinatus (viperid), no significant progress has been achieved in terms of diagnosis and management of biting species with appropriate anti-snake venom. Major hurdle is identification of offending species. Present study aims at differentiation of Indian BIG FOUR snake venoms based on their distinguish action on rodent blood coagulation. Assessment of coagulation alterations by elapid venoms showed negligible effect on re-calcification time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and factors assay (I, II, V, VIII and X) both in vitro and in vivo. However, viperid venoms demonstrated significant anticoagulant status due to their remarkable fibrinogen degradation potentials as supported by fibrinogenolytic activity, fibrinogen zymography and rotational thromboelastometry.

To review trends or patterns in the positions taken by members of the WTO with respect to tobacco control measures. To discuss possible explanations for these observed trends/patterns.--NEW SECTION--We gathered data on tobacco-related disputes in the WTO since its establishment in 1995 and its forerunner, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), prior-FCTC and post-FCTC. We also looked at debates on tobacco control measures within the WTO more broadly. To this end, we classified and coded the positions of WTO member states during discussions on tobacco control and the FCTC, from 1995 until 2013, within the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Council.--NEW SECTION--There is a growing interest within the WTO for tobacco-related issues and opposition to tobacco control measures is moving away from high-income countries towards low(er) income countries.--NEW SECTION--The growing prominence of tobacco issues in the WTO can be attributed at least in part to the fact that during the past decade tobacco firms have been marginalised from the domestic policy-making process in many countries, which has forced them to look for other ways and forums to influence decision-making. Furthermore, the finding that almost all recent opposition within the WTO to stronger tobacco regulations came from developing countries is consistent with a relative shift of transnational tobacco companies' lobbying efforts from developed to developing countries.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We undertook a literature search of seven electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Medline, Global Health, Web of Knowledge, Academic Search Complete and Africa Wide Information) and manually searched bibliographies of included articles. The search was restricted to population-based studies on hearing impairment in Africa. Data were extracted using a standard protocol.--NEW SECTION--We identified 232 articles and included 28 articles in the final analysis. The most common cut-offs used for hearing impairment were 25 and 30 dB HL, but this ranged between 15 and 40 dB HL. For a cut-off of 25 dB, the median was 7.7% for the children- or school-based studies and 17% for population-based studies. For a cut-off of 30 dB HL, the median was 6.6% for the children or school-based studies and 31% for population-based studies. In schools for the deaf, the most common cause of hearing impairment was cryptogenic deafness (50%) followed by infectious causes (43%). In mainstream schools and general population, the most common cause of hearing impairment was middle ear disease (36%), followed by undetermined causes (35%) and cerumen impaction (24%).--NEW SECTION--There are very few population-based studies available to estimate the prevalence of hearing impairment in Africa.

Nearly half of respondents (45%) reported decreased self-perceived efficiency in clinical care tasks. Qualitative data identified concerns related to STLs' professionalism and teamwork. Respondents also identified knowledge gaps in understanding differences in health systems and epidemiology in host country settings. Respondents preferred that rotations last at least 4 weeks and that STLs complete predeparture training.--NEW SECTION--STLs were largely positively regarded by international host clinical preceptors. To improve mutuality of benefits, sending institutions should ensure learners understand host country expectations of professionalism and that learners are well prepared for medical, ethical, and cultural challenges through participation in predeparture curricula that prepare them clinically and emotionally for these international experiences.

Babies born preterm have an elevated risk for long-term adverse medical and neurodevelopmental sequelae. Substantial evidence implicates intrauterine infection and/or inflammation in PTB. However, these are often relatively late findings in the process, when PTB is inevitable. Identification of earlier markers of PTB may make successful intervention possible. Although select proteins, notably those related to the inflammatory pathways, have been associated with PTB, there has been a lack of research into the role of other protein pathways in the development of PTB. The purpose of this study was to investigate, using a previously described biomarker discovery approach, a subset of circulating proteins and their association with PTB focusing on samples from early pregnancy.--NEW SECTION--The objectives of the study were as follows: (1) to perform a large-scale biomarker discovery, utilizing an innovative platform to identify proteins associated with preterm birth in plasma taken between 10 and 15 weeks' gestation and, (2) to determine which protein pathways are most strongly associated with preterm birth. To address these aims, we measured 1129 proteins in a plasma sample from early pregnancy using a multiplexed aptamer-based proteomic technology developed in Colorado by SomaLogic.--NEW SECTION--Using a nested case-control approach, we measured proteins at a single time point in early pregnancy in 41 women who subsequently delivered preterm and 88 women who had term uncomplicated deliveries. We measured 1129 proteins using a multiplexed aptamer-based proteomic technology developed by SomaLogic. Logistic regressions and random forests were used to compare protein levels.--NEW SECTION--The complement factors B and H and the coagulation factors IX and IX ab were the highest-ranking proteins distinguishing cases of preterm birth from term controls. The top 3 pathways associated with preterm birth were the complement cascade, the immune system, and the clotting cascade.--NEW SECTION--Using a discovery approach, these data provide further confirmation that there is an association of immune- and coagulation-related events in early pregnancy with preterm birth. Thus, plasma protein profiles at 10-15 weeks of gestation are related to the development of preterm birth later in pregnancy.",eng,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

HIV-1 affects the central nervous system by releasing viral proteins that trigger neuronal death and neuroinflammation, and promotes alterations known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). This disorder is not fully understood, and no specific treatments are available. Recently, we demonstrated that the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120IIIB induces a functional upregulation of the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7) in neuronal cells. Furthermore, this upregulation promotes cell death that can be abrogated with receptor antagonists, suggesting that α7 may play an important role in the development of HAND. The partial duplication of the gene coding for the α7, known as CHRFAM7A, negatively regulates α7 expression but its role in HIV infection has not been studied. Hence, we studied both CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A regulation patterns in various gp120IIIB in vitro conditions. In addition, we measured CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A expression levels in postmortem brain samples from patients suffering from different stages of HAND. Our results demonstrate the induction of CHRNA7 expression accompanied by a significant downregulation of CHRFAM7A in neuronal cells when exposed to pathophysiological concentrations of gp120IIIB. Our results suggest a dysregulation of CHRFAM7A and CHRNA7 expressions in the basal ganglia from postmortem brain samples of HIV+ subjects and expand the current knowledge about the consequences of HIV infection in the brain.",eng,Journal of neurovirology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

IL-17, a CD4 T cell-derived mediator of angiogenesis, plays a major role in stimulating angiogenesis by regulating the production of a variety of proangiogenic factors, including the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The level of VEGF expression correlates with tumor progression and metastasis in gastric cancer tissues. Abnormal activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) rendered the tumor cells highly angiogenic, which is manifested by an increased microvascular density (MVD) and considered it as a potential molecular marker for poor prognosis in gastric cancer angiogenesis. We determined that IL-17A-induced VEGF upregulation and neovascularization through a Stat3-mediated signaling pathway and hypothesized that blocking the Stat3 activation by using JSI-124, an inhibitor of phosphorylated Stat3, could significantly reduce the VEGF expression and can thus prevent angiogenesis. We showed an inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor progression when JSI-124 was treated with IL-17A in the cells and xenografts in an animal model and suggested that targeting the Stat pathway with JSI-124 could derive an effective therapeutic target for gastric cancers and could be a promising drug in gastric cancer treatment.",eng,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26566246,10.1002/hep.28280,Antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B viral infection in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Chronic hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection remains a significant global health problem. Evidence-based guidelines are needed to help providers determine when treatment should be initiated, which medication is most appropriate, and when treatment can safely be stopped. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases HBV guideline methodology and writing committees developed a protocol a priori for this systematic review. We searched multiple databases for randomized controlled trials and controlled observational studies that enrolled adults ≥18 years old diagnosed with chronic HBV infection who received antiviral therapy. Data extraction was done by pairs of independent reviewers. We included 73 studies, of which 59 (15 randomized controlled trials and 44 observational studies) reported clinical outcomes. Moderate-quality evidence supported the effectiveness of antiviral therapy in patients with immune active chronic HBV infection in reducing the risk of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In immune tolerant patients, moderate-quality evidence supports improved intermediate outcomes with antiviral therapy. Only very low-quality evidence informed the questions about discontinuing versus continuing antiviral therapy in hepatitis B e antigen-positive patients who seroconverted from hepatitis B e antigen to hepatitis B e antibody and about the safety of entecavir versus tenofovir. Noncomparative and indirect evidence was available for questions about stopping versus continuing antiviral therapy in hepatitis B e antigen-negative patients, monotherapy versus adding a second agent in patients with persistent viremia during treatment, and the effectiveness of antivirals in compensated cirrhosis with low-level viremia.--NEW SECTION--Most of the current literature focuses on the immune active phases of chronic HBV infection; decision-making in other commonly encountered and challenging clinical settings depends on indirect evidence.",eng,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In total, 81 countries or territories, having data at least for 5 years in 1990-1999 and in 2000-2009, were included in the analysis. Additional analysis for regional trends with 57 countries was performed.--NEW SECTION--Over the decades considered, analysis showed a declining trend in the overall suicide rate for males from 10.30 to 9.51 per 100,000 (p = .076), and for females from 4.39 to 4.18 (p = .472). The average suicide rate showed a significant decline for both genders in Europe, dropping from 13.13 to 10.93 (p = .001) in males and from 3.88 to 3.34 in females (p = .038). There was a significant increase in South American countries for males, from 7.36 to 11.47 (p = .016), and a close to significant rise for females, from 5.59 to 7.98 (p = .053). Although other world regions did not show significant trends, there were several significant changes at country level.--NEW SECTION--Reasons behind the decrease in Western countries could potentially be related to the overall improvements in global health; the possible contribution of suicide prevention activities remains unclear. Increases in several South American countries might be related to economic recession and its impact on adolescents from diverse cultural backgrounds, and partly also to improvements in mortality registration.",eng,The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

For the control of tuberculosis as well as other infectious diseases, WHO recommended ""ASSURED"" (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to the end user) diagnostic tools that can easily be maintained and used in developing countries. Aptamers are promising tools for developing point-of-care diagnostic assays for TB. In this study, ssDNA aptamers that recognize Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra were selected by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). For this purpose, two different selection protocols, ultrafiltration and centrifugation, were applied. A total of 21 TB specific aptamers were selected. These aptamers exhibited ""G-rich"" regions on the 3' terminus of the aptamers, including a motif of ""TGGGG,"" ""GTGG,"" or ""CTGG."" Binding capability of selected aptamers were investigated by quantitative PCR and Mtb36 DNA aptamer was found the most specific aptamer to M. tuberculosis H37Ra. The dissociation constant (K d) of Mtb36 aptamer was calculated as 5.09 ± 1.43 nM in 95% confidence interval. Relative binding ratio of Mtb36 aptamer to M. tuberculosis H37Ra over Mycobacterium bovis and Escherichia coli was also determined about 4 times and 70 times more, respectively.

26537672,10.1128/JVI.01835-15,Small Interfering RNA Pathway Modulates Initial Viral Infection in Midgut Epithelium of Insect after Ingestion of Virus.,"Numerous viruses are transmitted in a persistent manner by insect vectors. Persistent viruses establish their initial infection in the midgut epithelium, from where they disseminate to the midgut visceral muscles. Although propagation of viruses in insect vectors can be controlled by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) antiviral pathway, whether the siRNA pathway can control viral dissemination from the midgut epithelium is unknown. Infection by a rice virus (Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus [SRBSDV]) of its incompetent vector (the small brown planthopper [SBPH]) is restricted to the midgut epithelium. Here, we show that the siRNA pathway is triggered by SRBSDV infection in continuously cultured cells derived from the SBPH and in the midgut of the intact insect. Knockdown of the expression of the core component Dicer-2 of the siRNA pathway by RNA interference strongly increased the ability of SRBSDV to propagate in continuously cultured SBPH cells and in the midgut epithelium, allowing viral titers in the midgut epithelium to reach the threshold (1.99 × 10(9) copies of the SRBSDV P10 gene/μg of midgut RNA) needed for viral dissemination into the SBPH midgut muscles. Our results thus represent the first elucidation of the threshold for viral dissemination from the insect midgut epithelium. Silencing of Dicer-2 further facilitated the transmission of SRBSDV into rice plants by SBPHs. Taken together, our results reveal the new finding that the siRNA pathway can control the initial infection of the insect midgut epithelium by a virus, which finally affects the competence of the virus's vector.--NEW SECTION--Many viral pathogens that cause significant global health and agricultural problems are transmitted via insect vectors. The first bottleneck in viral infection, the midgut epithelium, is a principal determinant of the ability of an insect species to transmit a virus. Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) is restricted exclusively to the midgut epithelium of an incompetent vector, the small brown planthopper (SBPH). Here, we show that silencing of the core component Dicer-2 of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway increases viral titers in the midgut epithelium past the threshold (1.99 × 10(9) copies of the SRBSDV P10 gene/μg of midgut RNA) for viral dissemination into the midgut muscles and then into the salivary glands, allowing the SBPH to become a competent vector of SRBSDV. This result is the first evidence that the siRNA antiviral pathway has a direct role in the control of viral dissemination from the midgut epithelium and that it affects the competence of the virus's vector.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26537186,10.1002/stem.2232,Arsenic Promotes NF-Κb-Mediated Fibroblast Dysfunction and Matrix Remodeling to Impair Muscle Stem Cell Function.,"Arsenic is a global health hazard that impacts over 140 million individuals worldwide. Epidemiological studies reveal prominent muscle dysfunction and mobility declines following arsenic exposure; yet, mechanisms underlying such declines are unknown. The objective of this study was to test the novel hypothesis that arsenic drives a maladaptive fibroblast phenotype to promote pathogenic myomatrix remodeling and compromise the muscle stem (satellite) cell (MuSC) niche. Mice were exposed to environmentally relevant levels of arsenic in drinking water before receiving a local muscle injury. Arsenic-exposed muscles displayed pathogenic matrix remodeling, defective myofiber regeneration and impaired functional recovery, relative to controls. When naïve human MuSCs were seeded onto three-dimensional decellularized muscle constructs derived from arsenic-exposed muscles, cells displayed an increased fibrogenic conversion and decreased myogenicity, compared with cells seeded onto control constructs. Consistent with myomatrix alterations, fibroblasts isolated from arsenic-exposed muscle displayed sustained expression of matrix remodeling genes, the majority of which were mediated by NF-κB. Inhibition of NF-κB during arsenic exposure preserved normal myofiber structure and functional recovery after injury, suggesting that NF-κB signaling serves as an important mechanism of action for the deleterious effects of arsenic on tissue healing. Taken together, the results from this study implicate myomatrix biophysical and/or biochemical characteristics as culprits in arsenic-induced MuSC dysfunction and impaired muscle regeneration. It is anticipated that these findings may aid in the development of strategies to prevent or revert the effects of arsenic on tissue healing and, more broadly, provide insight into the influence of the native myomatrix on stem cell behavior.",eng,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Notwithstanding nuclear triage and management plans and technical monitoring standards within the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization (WHO), the capacity to rapidly deploy a robust professional workforce with the internal coordination and collaboration capabilities required for large-scale nuclear crises is profoundly lacking. A similar dilemma, evident in the early stages of the Ebola epidemic, was eventually managed by using worldwide infectious disease experts from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and multiple multidisciplinary WHO-supported foreign medical teams. This success has led the WHO to propose the development of a Global Health Workforce. A strategic format is proposed for nuclear preparedness and response that builds and expands on the current model for infectious disease outbreak currently under consideration. This study proposes the inclusion of a nuclear global health workforce under the technical expertise of the International Atomic Energy Agency and WHO's Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network leadership and supported by the International Health Regulations Treaty. Rationales are set forth for the development, structure, and function of a nuclear workforce based on health outcomes research that define the unique health, health systems, and public health challenges of a nuclear crisis. Recent research supports that life-saving opportunities are possible, but only if a rapidly deployed and robust multidisciplinary response component exists.",eng,Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,Historical Article,2025-04-23,2016

We designed a prospective pilot study investigating whether elderly patients (>60 years) would also be able to participate in such a programme. It consisted of physiotherapist-supervised alternating endurance and resistance workouts on 6 of 7 days a week. Sixteen consecutive patients undergoing allo-HSCT were enrolled into the study. The median age was 64.5 years. Twelve patients participated in the programme until the time of discharge (75%) from the transplant unit. Therefore, the predefined criteria regarding feasibility were met. The reason for drop out was transplantation associated mortality in all patients (n = 4). Adherence was very good with a median of 85% attended training sessions. No adverse events were recorded. The endurance capacity dropped by 7% and lower extremity strength improved by 2% over time. Quality of life decreased during the study period, with global health being significantly worse at the time of discharge. In conclusion, a combined and intensified strength and endurance exercise programme is feasible and safe in a population of elderly patients undergoing allo-HSCT.

This review discusses the link between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular diseases onset, focusing on the role of recently emerging downstream mediators, namely, oxidative stress and glucose metabolic pathway perturbations. The role of hyperglycemia-mediated activation of nonoxidative glucose pathways (NOGPs) [i.e., the polyol pathway, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and protein kinase C] in this process is extensively reviewed. The proposal is made that there is a unique interplay between NOGPs and a downstream convergence of detrimental effects that especially affect cardiac endothelial cells, thereby contributing to contractile dysfunction. In this process the AGE pathway emerges as a crucial mediator of hyperglycemia-mediated detrimental effects. In addition, a vicious metabolic cycle is established whereby hyperglycemia-induced NOGPs further fuel their own activation by generating even more oxidative stress, thereby exacerbating damaging effects on cardiac function. Thus NOGP inhibition, and particularly that of the AGE pathway, emerges as a novel therapeutic intervention for the treatment of cardiovascular complications such as acute myocardial infarction in the presence hyperglycemia.",eng,American journal of physiology.

The dosage of added sugar intake as a percentage of total energy was extracted or calculated. Means and standard deviations of pre- and post-test measurements or changes in ectopic fat depots were collected.--NEW SECTION--Fourteen RCTs were included. Most of the studies had a medium to high risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed that, compared with eucaloric controls, subjects who consumed added sugar under hypercaloric conditions likely increased ectopic fat, particularly in the liver (pooled standardized mean difference = 0.9 [95%CI, 0.6-1.2], n = 6) and muscles (pooled SMD = 0.6 [95%CI, 0.2-1.0], n = 4). No significant difference was observed in liver fat, visceral adipose tissue, or muscle fat when isocaloric intakes of different sources of added sugars were compared.--NEW SECTION--Data from a limited number of RCTs suggest that excess added sugar intake under hypercaloric diet conditions likely increases ectopic fat depots, particularly in the liver and in muscle fat. There are insufficient data to compare the effect of different sources of added sugars on ectopic fat deposition or to compare intake of added sugar with intakes of other macronutrients. Future well-designed RCTs with sufficient power and duration are needed to address the role of sugars on ectopic fat deposition.",eng,Nutrition reviews,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This disease is complex in nature because it arises from multiple interactions of genetic, local environmental, and host factors, resulting in biological heterogeneity. This genetic intricacy converges on molecular characteristics reflecting the pathophysiology, tumor biology, and clinical outcome. Therefore, understanding the molecular characteristics at a genomic level is pivotal to improving the clinical care of patients with gastric cancer. A recent landmark study, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, showed the molecular landscape of gastric cancer through a comprehensive molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric cancers. The proposed molecular classification divided gastric cancer into four subtypes: Epstein-Barr virus-positive, microsatellite unstable, genomic stable, and chromosomal instability. This information will be taken into account in future clinical trials and will be translated into clinical therapeutic decisions.

Few accounts are available of that significant yet cloistered synthesis process: none contemporaneous. In contrast, this study examines health's evolving location in the first-phase of the next iteration of global development goal negotiation for the post-2015 era, through the synchronous perspectives of representatives of key multilateral and related organizations. As part of the Go4Health Project, in-depth interviews were conducted in mid-2013 with 57 professionals working on health and the post-2015 agenda within multilaterals and related agencies. Using discourse analysis, this article reports the results and analysis of a Universal Health Coverage (UHC) theme: contextualizing UHC's positioning within the post-2015 agenda-setting process immediately after the Global Thematic Consultation on Health and High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda (High-Level Panel) released their post-2015 health and development goal aspirations in April and May 2013, respectively.

Although more participants support the High-Level Panel's May 2013 report's proposal-'Ensure Healthy Lives'-as the next umbrella health goal, they nevertheless still emphasize the need for UHC to achieve this and thus be incorporated as part of its trajectory. Despite UHC's conceptual ambiguity and cursory mention in the High-Level Panel report, its proponents suggest its re-emergence will occur in forthcoming State led post-2015 negotiations.

We analyzed data from 538 patients emergently hospitalized for acute LGIB. We used propensity score matching to adjust for differences between patients who underwent early colonoscopy vs elective colonoscopy. Outcomes included rates of adverse events during bowel preparation and colonoscopy procedures, stigmata of recent hemorrhage, endoscopic therapy, blood transfusion requirement, 30-day rebleeding and mortality, and length of hospital stay.--NEW SECTION--We selected 163 pairs of patients for analysis on the basis of propensity matching. We observed no significant differences between the early and elective colonoscopy groups in bowel preparation-related rates of adverse events (1.8% vs 1.2%, P = .652), colonoscopy-related rates of adverse events (none in either group), blood transfusion requirement (27.6% vs 27.6%, P = 1.000), or mortality (1.2% vs 0, P = .156). The early colonoscopy group had higher rates than the elective group for stigmata of recent hemorrhage (26.4% vs 9.2%, P < .001) and endoscopic therapy (25.8% vs 8.6%, P < .001), including clipping (17.8% vs 4.9%, P < .001), band ligation (6.1% vs 1.8%, P = .048), and rebleeding (13.5% vs 7.4%, P = .070). Patients in the early colonoscopy group stayed in the hospital for a shorter mean time (10 days) than patients in the elective colonoscopy group (13 days) (P < .001).--NEW SECTION--Early colonoscopy for patients with acute LGIB is safe, allows for endoscopic therapy because it identifies the bleeding source, and reduces hospital stay. However, compared with elective colonoscopy, early colonoscopy does not reduce mortality and may increase the risk for rebleeding.",eng,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Although the number of cases of azole-resistant aspergillosis is still limited, resistance mechanisms continue to emerge, thereby threatening the role of the azole class in the management of diseases caused by Aspergillus. The majority of cases of azole-resistant disease are due to resistant A. fumigatus originating from the environment. Patient management is difficult due to the absence of patient risk factors, delayed diagnosis, and limited treatment options, resulting in poor treatment outcome. International and collaborative efforts are required to understand how resistance develops in the environment to allow effective measures to be implemented aimed at retaining the use of azoles both for food production and human medicine.",eng,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Evidence from the Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was inconclusive due to lack of relevant data.--NEW SECTION--To complement the evidence from the Cochrane review, we assessed available data from non-randomized studies on the comparative efficacy and safety of alternative magnesium sulfate regimens for the management of preeclampsia and eclampsia. Sources included Medline, EMBASE, Popline, CINAHL, Global Health Library, African Index Medicus, Biological abstract, BIOSIS and reference lists of eligible studies. We selected non-randomized study designs including quasi-RCTs, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies that compared magnesium sulfate regimens in women with preeclampsia or eclampsia.--NEW SECTION--Of 6178 citations identified, 248 were reviewed in full text and five studies of low to very low quality were included. Compared with standard regimens, lower-dose regimens appeared equally as good in terms of preventing seizures [odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-2.28, 899 women, four studies], maternal morbidity (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.32-0.71, 796 women, three studies), and fetal and/or neonatal mortality (OR 0.87, 95%CI 0.38-2.00, 800 women, four studies). Comparison of loading dose only with maintenance dose regimens showed no differences in seizure rates (OR 0.99, 95%CI 0.22-4.50, 146 women, two studies), maternal morbidity (OR 0.53, 95%CI 0.15-1.93, 146 women, two studies), maternal mortality (OR 0.63, 95%CI 0.05-7.50, 146 women, two studies), and fetal and/or neonatal mortality (OR 0.49, 95%CI 0.23-1.03, 146 women, two studies).--NEW SECTION--Lower-dose and loading dose-only regimens could be as safe and efficacious as standard regimens; however, this evidence comes from low to very low quality studies and further high quality studies are needed.",eng,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

As such, it is crucial to explore factors related to the accuracy of children's reports of what they consumed.--NEW SECTION--The objective was to evaluate factors related to the accuracy of self-reported dietary intake information elicited by interview methods from children aged 6 to 12 years.--NEW SECTION--A systematic review of English articles using PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PsycEXTRA, PsycBOOKS, CINAHL Complete, Global Health, and MEDLINE Complete was performed. Search terms included interview, diet, children, and recall; studies were limited to those published from 1970 onward. Additional studies were identified using the reference lists of published articles. Studies that assessed children's dietary intake using direct observation, doubly labeled water, or the double-portion method and compared it with their recall of that intake (unassisted by parents) using an interview were included.--NEW SECTION--The 45 studies that met the inclusion criteria showed that specific interview techniques designed to enhance children's recall accuracy had little effect. Rather, the timing of the interview appeared most important: The shorter the retention interval between children's consumption and their recall, the more accurate their memories. Children's age, body mass index, social desirability, food preferences, and cognitive ability were also related to accuracy.--NEW SECTION--Factors related to the accuracy of children's dietary reporting should be taken into consideration when asking about consumption. Further research is required to examine whether other interview techniques, such as those developed to enhance children's recall of repeated staged events, can improve children's dietary reporting accuracy.",eng,Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

It is well documented that stress increases the incidences of various cardiovascular disorders. Regular exercise is known to reduce resting blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). This study was designed to clarify the effects of long-term exercise on stress-evoked cardiovascular responses and to emphasize post-stress recovery effects. Male Wistar rats underwent 8 weeks of moderate treadmill training, with cardiovascular responses, autonomic nervous system activities and local Fos reactivity changes in the cardiovascular regulation center were monitored before, during and after immobilization stress. A spectral analysis of cardiovascular parameters was used to examine autonomic nervous activities. We found that long-term exercise (i) lowered resting BP, HR and sympathetic activity, but increased resting parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS); (ii) accelerated post-stress recovery of stress-evoked cardiovascular and sympathetic responses along with increased BRS and (iii) accelerated post-stress recovery of stress-evoked neuron activations in the paraventricular nucleus, but delayed it in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius. We conclude that, in rats, long-term exercise accelerated recovery of stress-evoked cardiovascular responses differentially altering hypothalamic and medullar neuron activities.",eng,"Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

There is a paucity of published information on the cost-effectiveness of surgery in low- and middle-income countries, a key metric in the prioritisation of limited resources.--NEW SECTION--All patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, elective and emergency inguinal hernia repair, elective and emergency caesarean section, amputation, fracture manipulation, or fracture fixation over a 3 months period in a single district African hospital were assessed. World Health Organisation global burden of disease (GBD) methodology was used to calculate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved for each patient (using global and local life expectancy). Fully loaded costs were calculated for each patient’s care and providing the overall surgical service. Cost-effectiveness was calculated in year 2012 US$ per DALY saved for each procedure and overall.--NEW SECTION--A total of 428 patients were included, with an overall cost-effectiveness of $10.70 per DALY averted. The cost-effectiveness of individual procedures (global life expectancy) was: Amputation—$17.66; Emergency caesarean section—$7.42; Elective caesarean section—$20.50; Emergency laparotomy—$8.62; Elective hernia repair—$15.26; Emergency hernia repair—$4.36; Fracture/dislocation reduction—$69.03; Fracture/dislocation fixation—$225.89.--NEW SECTION--Surgery is a highly cost-effective healthcare measure in the setting of an African district hospital. The presented outcomes demonstrate that surgery is on a par with better-recognised and funded interventions such as HIV anti-retrovirals, malaria prevention and diarrhoea treatment. There are recognised limitations with the GBD methodology used here; however, this remains the best way to investigate the cost-effectiveness of health interventions. This study provides useful information on an, at present, under-studied field.",eng,World journal of surgery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26468529,10.1128/JVI.01849-15,The Phosphatidylserine and Phosphatidylethanolamine Receptor CD300a Binds Dengue Virus and Enhances Infection.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the etiological agent of the major human arboviral disease. We previously demonstrated that the TIM and TAM families of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) receptors involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells mediate DENV entry into target cells. We show here that human CD300a, a recently identified phospholipid receptor, also binds directly DENV particles and enhances viral entry. CD300a facilitates infection of the four DENV serotypes, as well as of other mosquito-borne viruses such as West Nile virus and Chikungunya virus. CD300a acts as an attachment factor that enhances DENV internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. CD300a recognizes predominantly phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEth) and to a lesser extent PtdSer associated with viral particles. Mutation of residues in the IgV domain critical for phospholipid binding abrogate CD300a-mediated enhancement of DENV infection. Finally, we show that CD300a is expressed at the surface of primary macrophages and anti-CD300a polyclonal antibodies partially inhibited DENV infection of these cells. Overall, these data indicate that CD300a is a novel DENV binding receptor that recognizes PtdEth and PtdSer present on virions and enhance infection.--NEW SECTION--Dengue disease, caused by dengue virus (DENV), has emerged as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans and is a major global health concern. The molecular bases of DENV-host cell interactions during virus entry are poorly understood, hampering the discovery of new targets for antiviral intervention. We recently discovered that the TIM and TAM proteins, two receptor families involved in the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer)-dependent phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells, interact with DENV particles-associated PtdSer through a mechanism that mimics the recognition of apoptotic cells and mediate DENV infection. In this study, we show that CD300a, a novel identified phospholipid receptor, mediates DENV infection. CD300a-dependent DENV infection relies on the direct recognition of phosphatidylethanolamine and to a lesser extent PtdSer associated with viral particles. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms that mediate DENV entry and reinforce the concept that DENV uses an apoptotic mimicry strategy for viral entry.",eng,Journal of virology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Two reviewers independently identified all manuscripts pertaining to the administration of ketamine in both human and animal subjects in which the impact on CBF/cerebral vasculature was recorded by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, xenon computed tomography, transcranial Doppler velocities, arteriovenous difference in N2O method of CBF measurement, cerebral digital subtraction angiography, or any other objective means of CBF determination.--NEW SECTION--We identified 38 animal studies with various animal models studied. Overall there was a trend to a direct vasodilatory effect of ketamine on the cerebral vasculature, with a trend in most studies to an increase or regional CBF (rCBF) or global CBF.Twenty human studies were identified. The majority displayed an increase in rCBF and global CBF on imaging in patients without neurological illness.--NEW SECTION--Animal models indicate an increase in global CBF and rCBF with ketamine administration, with a trend to vasodilation of medium-sized intracranial vessels through a calcium-dependent mechanism.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork between 2010 and 2012, in this article I explore efforts by a small-scale public-private partnership to use private veterinarians to sustainably control zoonotic sleeping sickness in Uganda. With a fundamental tension between business incentives and vector control, I show how divergences in knowledge, power, values, and social norms shaped project implementation and community responses. Reflecting more widely on the relationships between project plans and local realities, I argue that these encounters reveal the heuristic value in approaching global health interventions as evolving 'social experiments.'

We provide a scenario that includes the impact of alcohol on HIV/AIDS incidence, and qualitative predictions on future exposure and harm.--NEW SECTION--Overall, alcohol consumption has a large impact on burden of disease and mortality in African countries. Alcohol-attributable disease burden is more important when the impact of alcohol consumption on the incidence and course of HIV/AIDS is taken into account, with alcohol being responsible, in 2012, for 6.4% of all deaths and 4.7% of all DALYs lost in the African region. Alcohol exposure is expected to increase in the next years, and thus alcohol-attributable fractions.--NEW SECTION--The weight of new evidence, especially of alcohol's role in the incidence and course of HIV/AIDS, is particularly relevant to African countries and points to the need for a strong policy response to reduce the alcohol-related burden of disease on the continent.",eng,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

26438780,10.1093/heapol/czv070,Pneumonia's second wind? A case study of the global health network for childhood pneumonia.,"Advocacy, policy, research and intervention efforts against childhood pneumonia have lagged behind other health issues, including malaria, measles and tuberculosis. Accelerating progress on the issue began in 2008, following decades of efforts by individuals and organizations to address the leading cause of childhood mortality and establish a global health network. This article traces the history of this network's formation and evolution to identify lessons for other global health issues. Through document review and interviews with current, former and potential network members, this case study identifies five distinct eras of activity against childhood pneumonia: a period of isolation (post WWII to 1984), the duration of WHO's Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Programme (1984-1995), Integrated Management of Childhood illness's (IMCI) early years (1995-2003), a brief period of network re-emergence (2003-2008) and recent accelerating progress (2008 on). Analysis of these eras reveals the critical importance of building a shared identity in order to form an effective network and take advantage of emerging opportunities. During the ARI era, an initial network formed around a relatively narrow shared identity focused on community-level care. The shift to IMCI led to the partial dissolution of this network, stalled progress on addressing pneumonia in communities and missed opportunities. Frustrated with lack of progress on the issue, actors began forming a network and shared identity that included a broad spectrum of those whose interests overlap with pneumonia. As the network coalesced and expanded, its members coordinated and collaborated on conducting and sharing research on severity and tractability, crafting comprehensive strategies and conducting advocacy. These network activities exerted indirect influence leading to increased attention, funding, policies and some implementation.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Although reperfusion therapy is the treatment to increase blood supply to the ischemic myocardium, this intervention potentially causes cardiac tissue damage and instigates arrhythmias, processes known as reperfusion injury. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are glycemic control drugs commonly used in T2DM patients. Growing evidence from basic and clinical studies demonstrates that a DPP-4 inhibitor could exert cardioprotection and improve left ventricular function by reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and increasing reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) activity. However, recent reports also showed potentially adverse cardiac events due to the use of a DPP-4 inhibitor. To investigate this disparity, future large clinical trials are essential in verifying whether DPP-4 inhibitors are beneficial beyond their glycemic control particularly for the ischemic heart in obese-insulin resistant subjects and T2DM patients.",eng,International journal of cardiology,Letter,2025-04-23,2016

HPV also causes anal, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and oropharyngeal cancer. Prophylactic HPV vaccines based on recombinantly expressed virus-like particles have been developed. Two first-generation, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines prevent infections and disease caused by HPV16 and HPV18, the two HPV genotypes that cause approximately 70% of cervical cancer, and one of these vaccines also prevents HPV6 and HPV11, the two HPV genotypes that cause 90% of genital warts. A next-generation vaccine, recently approved by the U.S. FDA, targets HPV16, HPV18, and five additional HPV genotypes that together causes approximately 90% of cervical cancer as well as HPV6 and HPV11. In clinical trials, these vaccines have shown high levels of efficacy against disease and infections caused by the targeted HPV genotypes in adolescent females and males and older females. Data indicate population effectiveness, and therefore cost effectiveness, is highest in HPV-naive young females prior to becoming sexually active. Countries that implemented HPV vaccination before 2010 have already experienced decreases in population prevalence of targeted HPV genotypes and related anogenital diseases in women and via herd protection in heterosexual men. Importantly, after more than 100 million doses given worldwide, HPV vaccination has demonstrated an excellent safety profile. With demonstrated efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and safety, universal HPV vaccination of all young, adolescent women, and with available resources at least high-risk groups of men, should be a global health priority.

A more marked dose-response independent association was found with current smoking behaviour (ie, AOR2v1=2.47; AOR3v1=3.16; AOR4v1=3.62).--NEW SECTION--The marketing receptivity index was associated with important variation in smoking-related perceptions, intentions and behaviour among Argentine adolescents. Future research should determine the predictive validity and generalisability of this measure to other contexts, including the explanatory power gained by integrating cigarette package brand recognition tasks.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Outcomes were HrQoL (SF-12), infection-related concerns, global health status, fatigue (FACIT), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and somatic symptoms (SSS-8).--NEW SECTION--Comparisons between groups (n1=42, n2=32, n3=12) yielded no significant differences in HrQoL, subjective risk of infection, and most other psychosocial variables. However, the Ebola patient treatment group experienced significantly higher levels of social isolation than both other groups. The best predictors of poor physical and mental HrQoL were perceived lack of knowledge about the Ebola virus disease (physical: B=-1.2, p=0.05; mental: B=-1.3, p=0.03) and fatigue (physical: B=-0.3, p=0.02; mental: B=-0.53, p<0.001).--NEW SECTION--Ebola patient treatment in tertiary care does not seem to be associated with lower HrQoL and enhanced subjective risk of infection, but seems to yield feelings of social isolation in health-care professionals.",eng,Journal of psychosomatic research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

However, because of challenges in rolling out the technology and weak quality assurance measures, the promise of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related POCT in resource-limited settings has not been fully exploited to improve patient care and impact public health. Because of these challenges, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), in partnership with other organizations, recently launched the Diagnostics Access Initiative. Expanding HIV programs, including the ""test and treat"" strategies and the newly established UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, will require increased access to reliable and accurate POCT results.

The changes in bronchial microvasculature that occurin asthma and COPD contribute to airway wall remodeling. Angiogenesis seems to be more prevalent in asthma and vasodilatation seemsmore relevant in COPD while vascular leak is present in both diseases. Recently, there has been increased interest in the vascular component of airway remodeling in chronic bronchial inflammation of asthma and COPD although its role in the progression of the diseases has not been fully elucidated. Various cells andmediators are involved in the vascular remodeling in asthma and COPD while proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors exert angiogenic and antiangiogenic effects. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of blood vessel growth mainly in asthma but also in COPD. In asthmatic airways VEGF promotes proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells and induces vascular leakage and permeability. It has also been involved in enhanced allergic sensitization, upregulated subsequent T-helper-2 type inflammatory responses, chemotaxis for monocytes and eosinophils, and airway oedema. Impaired VEGF signaling has been associated with emphysema in animal models. Studies on lung biopsies have shown a decreasing effect of anti-asthma drugs to the vascular component of airway remodeling. There is less available evidence on the effect of the currently used drugs on airway microvascular network in COPD. This review article explores the current knowledge regarding vascular biomarkers in asthma and COPD as well as the therapeutic implications of these mediators.",eng,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Until 2013, Chikungunya infection had been largely restricted to East Africa and the Indian Ocean, with cases within the USA reported to be from foreign travel. However, in 2014, over 1 million suspected cases were reported in the Americas, and a recently infected human could serve as an unwitting reservoir for the virus resulting in an epidemic in the continental USA. Chikungunya infection is increasingly being associated with neurological sequelae. In this study, we sought to understand the role of astrocytes in the neuropathogenesis of Chikungunya infection. Even after virus has been cleared form the circulation, astrocytes were activated with regard to TLR2 expression. In addition, white matter astrocytes were hypertrophic, with increased arbor volume in gray matter astrocytes. Combined, these would alter the number and distribution of synapses that each astrocyte would be capable of forming. These results provide the first evidence that Chikungunya infection induces morphometric and innate immune activation of astrocytes in vivo. Perturbed glia-neuron signaling could be a major driving factor in the development of Chikungunya-associated neuropathology.",eng,Journal of neurovirology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Current Estimates and Limitations.,"Reducing the global burden of sepsis, a recognized global health challenge, requires comprehensive data on the incidence and mortality on a global scale.--NEW SECTION--To estimate the worldwide incidence and mortality of sepsis and identify knowledge gaps based on available evidence from observational studies.--NEW SECTION--We systematically searched 15 international citation databases for population-level estimates of sepsis incidence rates and fatality in adult populations using consensus criteria and published in the last 36 years.--NEW SECTION--The search yielded 1,553 reports from 1979 to 2015, of which 45 met our criteria. A total of 27 studies from seven high-income countries provided data for metaanalysis. For these countries, the population incidence rate was 288 (95% confidence interval [CI], 215-386; τ = 0.55) for hospital-treated sepsis cases and 148 (95% CI, 98-226; τ = 0.99) for hospital-treated severe sepsis cases per 100,000 person-years. Restricted to the last decade, the incidence rate was 437 (95% CI, 334-571; τ = 0.38) for sepsis and 270 (95% CI, 176-412; τ = 0.60) for severe sepsis cases per 100,000 person-years. Hospital mortality was 17% for sepsis and 26% for severe sepsis during this period. There were no population-level sepsis incidence estimates from lower-income countries, which limits the prediction of global cases and deaths. However, a tentative extrapolation from high-income country data suggests global estimates of 31.5 million sepsis and 19.4 million severe sepsis cases, with potentially 5.3 million deaths annually.--NEW SECTION--Population-level epidemiologic data for sepsis are scarce and nonexistent for low- and middle-income countries.

Previous study reported that early psychiatric intervention for advanced cancer patients may improve QOL. We evaluated the trajectory of health-related QOL (HRQOL) in patients with pancreatic cancer after an early psychiatric intervention.--NEW SECTION--A prospective cohort study was performed in 108 pancreatic cancer patients who received consultation liaison psychiatry from November, 2011 to October, 2014 at Nagoya University Hospital. Longitudinal changes in HRQOL and the association between aspects of HRQOL and survival were evaluated using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire core 30 before treatment and every month after the start of treatment.--NEW SECTION--Physical functioning significantly decreased after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment compared with baseline, but global health status (GHS), role functioning, emotional functioning, and social functioning showed a tendency to improve. Severe impairment of GHS, fatigue, and appetite loss were apparent at 3 months prior to death. In multivariate analysis, pain was a significant prognostic factor for survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.109; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.021-1.204; P = 0.013), in addition to poor performance status (HR, 5.473; 95%CI, 2.338-12.816; P < .0001) and distant metastases at diagnosis (HR, 3.274; 95%CI, 1.872-5.725; P < .0001).--NEW SECTION--Early psychiatric intervention in patients with pancreatic cancer may maintain HRQOL.

The recent clinical licensing of direct-acting antivirals enables viral cure. However, limited access to therapy and treatment failure in patient subgroups warrants a continuing effort to develop complementary antiviral strategies. Furthermore, once fibrosis is established, curing HCV infection does not eliminate the risk for HCC. High-throughput approaches and screens have enabled the investigation of virus-host interactions on a genome-wide scale. Gain- and loss-of-function screens have identified essential host-dependency factors in the HCV viral life cycle, such as host cell entry factors or regulatory factors for viral replication and assembly. Network analyses of systems-scale data sets provided a comprehensive view of the cellular state following HCV infection, thus improving our understanding of the virus-induced responses of the target cell. Interactome, metabolomics and gene expression studies identified dysregulated cellular processes potentially contributing to HCV pathogenesis and HCC. Drug screens using chemical libraries led to the discovery of novel antivirals. Here, we review the contribution of high-throughput approaches for the investigation of virus-host interactions, viral pathogenesis and drug discovery.",eng,Virus research,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Despite widespread recognition of this, young people, including those from culturally diverse backgrounds in wealthy nations such as Australia, remain largely hidden to, and underserved by, sexual and reproductive healthcare services. A scoping review was undertaken to describe the range of research on sexual and reproductive health among culturally diverse young people in Australia, in order to identify gaps in the literature. This comprised a systematic literature search and key informant consultations, followed by descriptive thematic analysis of the included literature. One hundred and twenty papers were deemed eligible for inclusion, and findings are presented as three separate analyses. The first provides an overview of four dimensions identified in the literature: (i) cultural diversity; (ii) the resettlement experiences of migrant communities; (iii) the sexual and reproductive health needs of these communities; and (iv) the practices of health services in this field. The second explores what is known from the literature about culturally diverse young people's needs for, use of, and engagement with services for sexual and reproductive health, while the third identifies two knowledge gaps: (1) the perspectives of culturally diverse young people regarding sexual and reproductive health and health care; and (2) the engagement of culturally diverse young people with sexual and reproductive health services.

We use this model to study patient time courses of viral load under treatment with daclatasvir, an inhibitor of the viral non-structural protein NS5A. Model analysis predicts that treatment efficacy can be increased by combining daclatasvir with dedicated viral polymerase inhibitors, corresponding to promising current strategies in drug development.

In recent years, diseases associated with inflammation and septicemia have already become a global health issue. Therefore, there is a rising demand for the development of novel ""super"" antibiotics. In this context, antimicrobial peptides offer an attractive, alternate therapeutic solution to conventional antibiotics.--NEW SECTION--Microbroth dilution assay was performed to investigate the antimicrobial activities of the two designed peptides against Gram negative bacterial pathogens. Fluorescence studies including NPN dye uptake assay, Calcein entrapped vesicle leakage assay, quenching and anisotropy in presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were performed to elucidate binding interactions and enhanced membrane permeabilisation. Hemolytic assay and endotoxin/LPS neutralisation assay were performed to study the hemolytic effects and LPS scavenging abilities of the peptides. High resolution NMR studies were performed to obtain insights into LPS-peptide interaction at the molecular level.--NEW SECTION--Here, we report more potent analogues of previously designed peptide VG16KRKP, designed through dimerization via Cys-Cys disulphide linkage and N-terminal lipidation. Similar to the parent peptide, VG16KRKP, the modified analogue peptides are non hemolytic in nature, but possessed, 2-10-fold increase in antibacterial activities against E. coli, human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the devastating plant pathogen, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris as well as membrane permeabilization, and endotoxin neutralization. LPS bound solution structure of both analogues, as determined by NMR spectroscopy, reveal that the conserved hydrophobic triad motif, formed by Trp5, Leu11 and Phe12 is compactly organized and stabilized either by the acyl chain or disulphide bond. This structural constraint accounts for the separation of polar face from the hydrophobic face of the peptides. Our novel peptides designed through Cys-Cys dimerization and N-terminal lipidation, will serve as a template to develop more potent antimicrobials in future, to control plant and human diseases.",eng,Journal of colloid and interface science,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

26405157,10.1093/heapol/czv092,Network advocacy and the emergence of global attention to newborn survival.,"Globally 2.9 million babies die each year before reaching 28 days of life. Over the past quarter century, neonatal mortality has declined at a slower pace than post-neonatal under-five mortality: in consequence newborns now comprise 44% of all deaths to children under five years. Despite high numbers of newborn deaths, global organizations and national governments paid little attention to the issue until 2000, and resources, while growing since then, remain inadequate. This study examines the factors behind these patterns of policy attention: the delayed emergence of attention, its sudden appearance in 2000, its growth thereafter, but the dearth of resources to date. Drawing on a framework on global health networks grounded in collective action theory, the study finds that a newborn survival network helped to shift perceptions about the problem's severity and tractability, contributing to the rise of global attention. Its efforts were facilitated by pressure on governments to achieve the child survival Millennium Development Goal and by growing awareness that the neonatal period constituted a growing percentage of under-five mortality, a fact the network publicized. The network's relatively recent emergence, its predominantly technical rather than political composition and strategies, and its inability to date to find a framing of the issue that has convinced national political leaders of the issue's urgency, in part explain the insufficiency of resources. However, since 2010 a number of non-health oriented inter-governmental organizations have begun to pay attention to the issue, and several countries with high neonatal mortality have created national plans, developments which augur well for the future. The study points to two broader implications concerning how neglected global health issues come to attract attention: priority emerges from a confluence of factors, rather than any single cause; and growth in priority may depend on the creation of a broader political coalition that extends beyond the largely technically oriented actors who may first press for attention to a problem.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

All patients received a questionnaire on HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30), illness perception (B-IPQ) and satisfaction with information provision (EORTC QLQ-INFO-25). Multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the association between satisfaction with information provision and HRQoL as well as illness perception.--NEW SECTION--Response rate was 70% (N = 697), 34% (N = 222) indicated to be dissatisfied with the information received. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed a significant positive association between satisfaction with information provision and global health (P = <0.001), emotional functioning (P = 0.004), social functioning (P = 0.027), physical functioning (P = 0.002) and role functioning (P = 0.001).

These developments provide an interesting case study into the factors that contribute to the sustainability of initiatives to support and co-ordinate global health research in the 21st century.--NEW SECTION--We reviewed the history of attempts to govern, support or co-ordinate research in global health. Moreover, we studied the changes and shifts in funding flows attributed to global health research. This allowed us to map the structure of the global health research system, as it has evolved under the increased funding contributions of the past decade. Bearing in mind its structure, core functions and dynamic nature, we proposed a framework on how to effectively support the system to increase its efficiency.--NEW SECTION--Based on our framework, which charted the structure and function of the global health research system and exposed places and roles for many stakeholders within the system, five basic needs emerged: (i) to co-ordinate funding among donors more effectively; (ii) to prioritize among many research ideas; (iii) to quickly recognize results of successful research; (iv) to ensure broad and rapid dissemination of results and their accessibility; and (v) to evaluate return on investments in health research.--NEW SECTION--The global health research system has evolved rapidly and spontaneously. It has not been optimally efficient, but it is possible to identify solutions that could improve this. There are already examples of effective responses for the need of prioritization of research questions (eg, the CHNRI method), quick recognition of important research (eg, systems used by editors of the leading journals) and rapid and broadly accessible publication of the new knowledge (eg, PLoS One journal as an example).

I show that the encounter between the feasible and the fantastic in the realm of public health generates feelings of absurdity and futility among medical professionals, characteristic of disease control in the precarious present. Precarity is neither a social and economic condition per se, nor is the link between disease and precarity static. It is a dynamic process of political inclusions, exclusions, and inequalities, which differ substantially within the unequal spheres of precarious lives.

26377525,10.1177/1090198115604623,Baseline Evaluation of a Participatory Mobile Health Intervention for Dengue Prevention in Sri Lanka.,"Challenges posed by infectious disease outbreaks have led to a range of participatory mobile phone-based innovations that use the power of crowdsourcing for disease surveillance. However, the dynamics of participatory behavior by crowds in such interventions have yet to be examined. This article reports results from a baseline evaluation of one such intervention called Mo-Buzz, a mobile-based crowdsource-driven socially mediated system developed to address gaps in dengue surveillance and education in Colombo, Sri Lanka. We conducted a 30-minute cross-sectional field survey (N = 404) among potential users of Mo-Buzz in Colombo. We examined individual, institutional, and cultural factors that influence their potential intention-to-use Mo-Buzz and assessed if these factors varied by demographic factors. Descriptive analysis revealed high perceived ease-of-use (PEOU; M = 3.81, SD = 0.44), perceived usefulness (PU; M = 4.01, SD = 0.48), and intention-to-use (PI; M = 3.91, SD = 0.46) among participants. Analysis of variance suggested participants in the 31 to 40 years age group reported highest PEOU, whereas the oldest group reported high perceived institutional efficacy (M = 3.59, SD = 0.64) and collectivistic tendencies. Significant differences (at the p < .05 level) were also found by education and income. Regression analysis demonstrated that PU, behavioral control, institutional efficacy, and collectivism were significant predictors of PI. We concluded that despite high overall PI, future adoption and use of Mo-Buzz will be shaped by a complex mix of factors at different levels of the public health ecology. Implications of study findings from theoretical and practical perspectives related to the future adoption of mobile-based participatory systems in public health are discussed and ideas for a future research agenda presented.",eng,Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016

Participants enrolled ranged from 50 to 71 years of age, residing in six U.S. states and two cities. Cox proportional hazard models yielded hazard ratio (HR) estimates per 10 μg/m3 of PM2.5 exposure.--NEW SECTION--PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with total mortality (HR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.05) and CVD mortality (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.15), but the association with respiratory mortality was not statistically significant (HR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.13). A significant association was found with respiratory mortality only among never smokers (HR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.56). Associations with 10-μg/m3 PM2.5 exposures in yearly participant residential annual mean, or in metropolitan area-wide mean, were consistent with baseline exposure model results. Associations with PM2.5 were similar when adjusted for ozone exposures. Analyses of California residents alone also yielded statistically significant PM2.5 mortality HRs for total and CVD mortality.--NEW SECTION--Long-term exposure to PM2.5 air pollution was associated with an increased risk of total and CVD mortality, providing an independent test of the PM2.5-mortality relationship in a new large U.S. prospective cohort experiencing lower post-2000 PM2.5 exposure levels.--NEW SECTION--Thurston GD, Ahn J, Cromar KR, Shao Y, Reynolds HR, Jerrett M, Lim CC, Shanley R, Park Y, Hayes RB. 2016.

26366470,10.3111/13696998.2015.1093493,Comparison of historical medical spending patterns among the BRICS and G7.,"The past few decades have been marked by a bold increase in national health spending across the globe. Rather successful health reforms in leading emerging markets such as BRICS reveal a reshaping of their medical care-related expenditures. There is a scarcity of evidence explaining differences in long-term medical spending patterns between top ranked G7 traditional welfare economies and the BRICS nations.--NEW SECTION--A retrospective observational study was conducted on a longitudinal WHO Global Health Expenditure data-set based on the National Health Accounts (NHA) system. Data were presented in a simple descriptive manner, pointing out health expenditure dynamics and differences between the two country groups (BRICS and G7) and individual nations in a 1995-2013 time horizon.--NEW SECTION--Average total per capita health spending still remains substantially higher among G7 (4747 Purchase Power Parity (PPP) $PPP in 2013) compared to the BRICS (1004 $PPP in 2013) nations. The percentage point share of G7 in global health expenditure (million current PPP international $US) has been falling constantly since 1995 (from 65% in 1995 to 53.2% in 2013), while in BRICS nations it grew (from 10.7% in 1995 to 20.2% in 2013). Chinese national level medical spending exceeded significantly that of all G7 members except the US in terms of current $PPP in 2013.--NEW SECTION--Within a limited time horizon of only 19 years it appears that the share of global medical spending by the leading emerging markets has been growing steadily. Simultaneously, the world's richest countries' global share has been falling constantly, although it continues to dominate the landscape. If the contemporary global economic mainstream continues, the BRICS per capita will most likely reach or exceed the OECD average in future decades. Rising out-of-pocket expenses threatening affordability of medical care to poor citizens among the BRICS nations and a too low percentage of GDP in India remain the most notable setbacks of these developments.",eng,Journal of medical economics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

While epidemiologists and public health practitioners and scholars have long expressed concern with the changing global distribution of the burden of NCDs, it is only in more recent years that the aetiology, politics and consequences of these shifts have become an object of critical social scientific enquiry. These shifts mark the starting point for this special issue on 'The Politics of NCDs in the Global South' and act as the basis for new, critical interventions in how we understand NCDs. In this paper, we aim not only to introduce and contextualise the six contributions that form this special issue, but also to identify and explore three themes - problematisation, care and culture - that index the main areas of analytical and empirical concern that have motivated analyses of NCDs in the global South and are central to critical engagement with their political contours.",eng,Health & place,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

For effective control of this dreadful disease, it is necessary to diagnose TB cases at the initial stages of infection. The serodiagnosis of disease represents simple, rapid and inexpensive method that can be used at the primary health care levels. In this study we have compared sensitivity of two PPE proteins of M. tuberculosis, i.e., Rv0256c and Rv1168c for their use as serodiagnostic markers in active tuberculosis patients. Employing a standardized enzyme immunoassay with these PPE proteins as candidate antigens we were able to successfully discriminate the TB patients' sera from the BCG-vaccinated healthy controls. Further, we observed that Rv1168c displayed higher sensitivity in detecting extrapulmonary and smear negative pulmonary TB cases which are difficult to diagnose by available diagnostic methods. Overall the study highlights that Rv1168c can be used as a potential serodiagnostic marker for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis disease.",eng,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Insulin resistance is closely associated with obesity and precedes the development of type 2 diabetes. However, there is now increasing evidence to suggest that diet itself may independently be associated with type 2 diabetes risk. A diet with a high acid load (or high potential renal net acid load, PRAL) can result in a decrease in pH towards the lower end of the normal physiological range, which may in turn lead to the development of insulin resistance. Conversely, reducing dietary acid load (the so called 'alkaline diet') may be protective and prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes. Here, we explore the influence of dietary acid load on the development of mild metabolic acidosis and induction of insulin resistance. Whilst large prospective cohort studies link high dietary acid load or low serum bicarbonate with the development of type 2 diabetes, the effect of a diet with a low acid (or high alkaline) load remains unclear. Further interventional studies are required to investigate the influence of dietary composition on the body's acid/base balance, insulin resistance and incidence of type 2 diabetes.",eng,Biochimie,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

26360801,10.1111/pbi.12476,Expression of β-glucosidase increases trichome density and artemisinin content in transgenic Artemisia annua plants.,"Artemisinin is highly effective against multidrug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, the aetiological agent of the most severe form of malaria. However, a low level of accumulation of artemisinin in Artemisia annua is a major limitation for its production and delivery to malaria endemic areas of the world. While several strategies to enhance artemisinin have been extensively explored, enhancing storage capacity in trichome has not yet been considered. Therefore, trichome density was increased with the expression of β-glucosidase (bgl1) gene in A. annua through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgene (bgl1) integration and transcript were confirmed by molecular analysis. Trichome density increased up to 20% in leaves and 66% in flowers of BGL1 transgenic plants than Artemisia control plants. High-performance liquid chromatography, time of flight mass spectrometer data showed that artemisinin content increased up to 1.4% in leaf and 2.56% in flowers (per g DW), similar to the highest yields achieved so far through metabolic engineering. Artemisinin was enhanced up to five-fold in BGL1 transgenic flowers. This study opens the possibility of increasing artemisinin content by manipulating trichomes' density, which is a major reservoir of artemisinin. Combining biosynthetic pathway engineering with enhancing trichome density may further increase artemisinin yield in A. annua. Because oral feeding of Artemisia plant cells reduced parasitemia more efficiently than the purified drug, reduced drug resistance and cost of prohibitively expensive purification process, enhanced expression should play a key role in making this valuable drug affordable to treat malaria in a large global population that disproportionally impacts low-socioeconomic areas and underprivileged children.",eng,Plant biotechnology journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Evidence from a meta-analysis of associations between stunting and multidimensional child development in fifteen low- and middle-income countries.,"Despite documented associations between stunting and cognitive development, few population-level studies have measured both indicators in individual children or assessed stunting's associations with other developmental domains.--NEW SECTION--Meta-analysis using publicly available data from fifteen Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS-4) to assess the association between stunting and development, controlling for maternal education, family wealth, books in the home, developmentally supportive parenting and sex of the child, stratified by country prevalence of breast-feeding ('low BF'<90 %, 'high BF' ≥90 %). Ten-item Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI) scores assessed physical, learning, literacy/numeracy and socio-emotional developmental domains. Children on track in three or four domains were considered 'on-track' overall.--NEW SECTION--Fifteen low- and middle-income countries.--NEW SECTION--Publically available data from 58 513 children aged 36-59 months.--NEW SECTION--Severe stunting (height-for-age Z-score <-3) was negatively associated with on-track development (OR=0·75; 95 % CI 0·67, 0·83). Any stunting (Z-score <-2) was negatively associated with on-track development in countries with high BF prevalence (OR=0·82; 95 % CI 0·75, 0·89). Severe and any stunting were negatively associated with physical development (OR=0·77; 95 % CI 0·66, 0·89 and OR=0·82; 95 % CI 0·74, 0·91, respectively) and literacy/numeracy development in high BF countries (OR=0·45; 95 % CI 0·38, 0·53 and OR=0·59, 95 % CI 0·51, 0·68, respectively), but not low BF countries (OR=0·93; 95 % CI 0·70, 1·23 and OR=0·95, 95 % CI 0·79, 1·12, respectively). Any stunting was negatively associated with learning (OR=0·79; 95 % CI 0·72, 0·88).

Nutrition Information Panel data for 23 sub-categories of packaged snack foods (n = 3481) were extracted from The George Institute for Global Health's 2013 branded food composition database. Variations in serving size and energy content per serving were examined. Energy contents per serving were compared to recommendations in the Australian Dietary Guidelines. Serving sizes varied within and between snack food categories. Mean energy content per serving varied from 320 kJ to 899 kJ. More energy per serving than the recommended 600 kJ was displayed by 22% (n = 539) of snack foods classified in the Australian Dietary Guidelines as discretionary foods. The recommendation for energy content per serving was exceeded in 60% (n = 635) of snack foods from the Five Food Groups. Only 37% (n = 377) of confectionery products displayed the industry-agreed serving size of 25 g. Energy content per serving of many packaged snack foods do not align with the Australian Dietary Guidelines and the industry agreed serving size has not been taken up widely within the confectionery category. Given the inconsistencies in serving sizes, featuring serving size in front-of-pack information may hinder the objective of a clear and simple nutrition message.

Virtual interactive presence and augmented reality (VIPAR), an iPad-based tool, allows surgeons to provide long-distance, virtual assistance wherever a wireless internet connection is available. Local and remote surgeons view a composite image of video feeds at each station, allowing for intraoperative telecollaboration in real time.--NEW SECTION--Local and remote stations were established in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and Birmingham, Alabama, as part of ongoing neurosurgical collaboration. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus coagulation with VIPAR was used for subjective and objective evaluation of system performance.--NEW SECTION--VIPAR allowed both surgeons to engage in complex visual and verbal communication during the procedure. Analysis of 5 video clips revealed video delay of 237 milliseconds (range, 93-391 milliseconds) relative to the audio signal. Excellent image resolution allowed the remote neurosurgeon to visualize all critical anatomy. The remote neurosurgeon could gesture to structures with no detectable difference in accuracy between stations, allowing for submillimeter precision. Fifteen endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus coagulation procedures have been performed with the use of VIPAR between Vietnam and the United States, with no significant complications. 80% of these patients remain shunt-free.--NEW SECTION--Evolving technologies that allow long-distance, intraoperative guidance, and knowledge transfer hold great potential for highly efficient international neurosurgical education.

The prognostic value of PROs in patients with isolated liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) who undergo surgery is unclear. In this study we investigated whether baseline PROs are prognostic in this patient group.--NEW SECTION--From April 2004 to May 2007, consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of CRC liver metastases completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-LMC21 questionnaires before surgery. Patients were followed until death or data were censored on April 9, 2012. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the effect of PROs on survival controlling for predefined clinical covariates. Models were simplified using a backwards stepwise approach and model utility appraised using the Harrell C and Somers D statistics and bootstrap methods.--NEW SECTION--Two hundred thirty-two patients underwent liver resection and 101 (43.5%) survived 5 years. Multivariate analysis controlling for relevant clinical covariates showed that a 10-point improvement in baseline global quality of life scores was associated with a 54% improvement in survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.63; P < .001), and a clinically significant weight loss was associated with 75% worse survival (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.20-2.55; P = .004). Smaller effects were noted for worsening abdominal pain, taste problems, and fatigue (30%-38% poorer survival). Results of bootstrap resampling suggested that global health and weight loss most reliably predicted survival.--NEW SECTION--Results of this study demonstrated that patients who reported worse baseline global quality of life and increased weight loss before liver resection for CRC liver metastases had significantly poorer survival.

Chronically infected people are at risk for progressive hepatic fibrosis and consequent cirrhosis. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) level in serum is a complementary marker for intrahepatic HBV DNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Sortilin-1 (SORT1) has been reported to be involved in the post-Golgi vesicle trafficking of Apo lipoproteins degradation pathways. This study was designed to evaluate the hepatic and serum expression of HBsAg and its association with hepatic SORT1 gene expression in patients with chronic HBV. Thirty chronic hepatitis B patients with histological examination results were enrolled in this study. Liver biopsies were analyzed for hepatic HBsAg and SORT1 gene expression by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), respectively. Twenty seven out of 30 (90%) liver biopsies had positive staining for HBsAg and showed a significant inverse association with hepatic SORT1 fold change gene expression (β = -0.5, P = 0.042). There was significant association between HBV DNA levels and HBsAg expression in hepatocyte or serum titer of HBsAg (r = 0.39, P = 0.029; r = 0.39, P = 0.032 respectively). Serum ALT was also correlated with hepatic activity index (HAI) score (β = 0.6, P = 0.001).

While combined antiretroviral therapy has been successful in controlling the virus in patients, HIV can develop resistance to drugs used for treatment, rendering available drugs less effective and limiting treatment options. Initiatives to find novel drugs for HIV treatment are ongoing, although traditional drug design approaches often focus on known binding sites for inhibition of established drug targets like reverse transcriptase and integrase. These approaches tend towards generating more inhibitors in the same drug classes already used in the clinic. Lack of diversity in antiretroviral drug classes can result in limited treatment options, as cross-resistance can emerge to a whole drug class in patients treated with only one drug from that class. A fresh approach in the search for new HIV-1 drugs is fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), a validated strategy for drug discovery based on using smaller libraries of low molecular weight molecules (<300 Da) screened using primarily biophysical assays. FBDD is aimed at not only finding novel drug scaffolds, but also probing the target protein to find new, often allosteric, inhibitory binding sites. Several fragment-based strategies have been successful in identifying novel inhibitory sites or scaffolds for two proven drug targets for HIV-1, reverse transcriptase and integrase. While any FBDD-generated HIV-1 drugs have yet to enter the clinic, recent FBDD initiatives against these two well-characterised HIV-1 targets have reinvigorated antiretroviral drug discovery and the search for novel classes of HIV-1 drugs.",eng,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Ebola virus disease (EVD), a severe viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome caused by Ebola virus (EBOV) is transmitted by direct contact with the body fluids of infected person and objects contaminated with virus or infected animals. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared EVD epidemic as public health emergency of international concern with severe global economic burden. At fatal EBOV infection stage, patients usually die before the antibody response. Currently, rapid blood tests to diagnose EBOV infection include the antigen or antibodies capture using ELISA and RNA detection using RT/Q-PCR within 3-10 days after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, few nanotechnology-based colorimetric and paper-based immunoassay methods have been recently reported to detect Ebola virus. Unfortunately, these methods are limited to laboratory only. As state-of-the art (SoA) diagnostics time to confirm Ebola infection, varies from 6h to about 3 days, it causes delay in therapeutic approaches. Thus developing a cost-effective, rapid, sensitive, and selective sensor to detect EVD at point-of-care (POC) is certainly worth exploring to establish rapid diagnostics to decide therapeutics. This review highlights SoA of Ebola diagnostics and also a call to develop rapid, selective and sensitive POC detection of EBOV for global health care. We propose that adopting miniaturized electrochemical EBOV immunosensing can detect virus level at pM concentration within ∼40min compared to 3 days of ELISA test at nM levels.",eng,Biosensors & bioelectronics,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26318679,10.1093/heapol/czu046,A framework on the emergence and effectiveness of global health networks.,"Since 1990 mortality and morbidity decline has been more extensive for some conditions prevalent in low- and middle-income countries than for others. One reason may be differences in the effectiveness of global health networks, which have proliferated in recent years. Some may be more capable than others in attracting attention to a condition, in generating funding, in developing interventions and in convincing national governments to adopt policies. This article introduces a supplement on the emergence and effectiveness of global health networks. The supplement examines networks concerned with six global health problems: tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia, tobacco use, alcohol harm, maternal mortality and newborn deaths. This article presents a conceptual framework delineating factors that may shape why networks crystallize more easily surrounding some issues than others, and once formed, why some are better able than others to shape policy and public health outcomes. All supplement papers draw on this framework. The framework consists of 10 factors in three categories: (1) features of the networks and actors that comprise them, including leadership, governance arrangements, network composition and framing strategies; (2) conditions in the global policy environment, including potential allies and opponents, funding availability and global expectations concerning which issues should be prioritized; (3) and characteristics of the issue, including severity, tractability and affected groups. The article also explains the design of the project, which is grounded in comparison of networks surrounding three matched issues: TB and pneumonia, tobacco use and alcohol harm, and maternal and newborn survival.

A control group of 57 healthy volunteers was also evaluated. The questionnaire was translated into Moroccan language.--NEW SECTION--Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.829, suggesting good internal consistency, and test-retest reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.987). A good correlation was observed between UW-QOL composite scores and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) global health status/QOL scores (P < .001). There was also low concordance between the UW-QOL scores and the Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores of the 36-Item Short-Form questionnaire (SF-36) (P = .017 and P = .014, respectively).--NEW SECTION--The Moroccan UW-QOL questionnaire appears to be culturally appropriate and psychometrically valid.",eng,"The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Data analysis included: (1) evaluations of differences in PGH-7 scores between groups defined by sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, and access to health care; (2) associations with 15 PROMIS pediatric measures; and (3) correlations with two health-related quality-of-life instruments, the KIDSCREEN-10 and PedsQL-15.--NEW SECTION--PGH-7 scores were lower for children with chronic conditions, Hispanic ethnicity, low socioeconomic status, and barriers to accessing health care. The PGH-7 showed excellent convergent and discriminant validity with PROMIS pediatric measures of physical, mental, and social health. The PGH-7 was strongly correlated with the KIDSCREEN-10, which assesses positive health, and moderately correlated with the PedsQL-15, which assesses problems with a child's health.--NEW SECTION--The PGH-7 measures global health, summarizing a child's physical, mental, and social health into a single score. These properties make it a useful clinical, population health, and research tool for applications that require an efficient, precise, and valid summary measure of a children's self-reported health status. Future research should prospectively evaluate the PGH-7's capacity to detect change that results from alterations in clinical status, transformations of the healthcare delivery system, and children's health development.",eng,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26307936,10.1002/pri.1645,Global Health Competencies for Physiotherapist Education in the United States.,"Increasingly global health education is being incorporated into health professions' curricula. Various disciplines have defined global health competencies (GHC) for their areas of professional practice. However, physiotherapist educators have not delineated GHC for physiotherapist education. This study's purpose was to develop GHC for United States (US)-based physiotherapist education.--NEW SECTION--We developed an online survey using 30 GHC from a nursing study and 4 GHC that we developed. We recruited physiotherapists who were clinicians and/or faculty employed in the US, or who had been employed as clinicians and/or faculty in the US within the past 5 years to complete the survey. We examined descriptive data for Likert responses and used content analysis for analysis of open-ended responses. The University of Texas at El Paso Institutional Review Board granted exempt status for the study.--NEW SECTION--One hundred eighty-eight participants completed the survey. A majority agreed or strongly agreed that 33 of the total 34 GHC were relevant to physiotherapist education. Four major categories emerged from open-ended responses: beyond entry level, greater relevance to physiotherapy, emphasis on US concerns, and value of understanding international issues and perspectives.--NEW SECTION--Although most participants agreed with the GHC, open-ended responses indicated the need for revision of the GHC to make them more relevant to entry-level physiotherapist education. We plan to revise the GHC and then validate the modified GHC through a future Delphi study. Study limitations include the limited number of participants and that the lack of an operational definition of 'global health' may have created confusion.--NEW SECTION--The study's results may inform physiotherapist educators inside and outside of the US as they contend with determining how to most effectively prepare physiotherapist students for competent practice in a globalized world.

We assessed the impact of smoking on life expectancy worldwide between 1980 and 2010.--NEW SECTION--We retrieved cause-specific mortality data from the WHO Mortality Database by sex, year and age for 63 countries with high or moderate quality data (1980-2010). Using the time of the peak of the smoking epidemic by country, relative risks from the three waves of the Cancer Prevention Study were applied to calculate the smoking impact ratio and population attributable fraction. Finally, we estimated the potential gain in life expectancy at age 40 if smoking-related deaths in middle age (40-79 years) were eliminated.--NEW SECTION--Currently, tobacco smoking is related to approximately 20% of total adult mortality in the countries in this study (24% in men and 12% in women). If smoking-related deaths were eliminated, adult life expectancy would increase on average by 2.4 years in men (0.1 in Uzbekistan to 4.8 years in Hungary) and 1 year in women (0.1 in Kyrgyzstan to 2.9 years in the USA). The proportion of smoking-related mortality among men has declined in most countries, but has increased in the most populous country in the world, that is, China from 4.6% to 7.3%. Increases in the impact of tobacco on life expectancy were observed among women in high-income countries.--NEW SECTION--Recent trends indicate a substantial rise in the population-level impact of tobacco smoking on life expectancy in women and in middle-income countries.

Drawing on qualitative, ethnographic research with indigenous women and health workers, the paper demonstrates that women experience poor-quality HIV education and counselling, and that indigenous practices and concerns are largely not addressed by HIV services. We attribute this to a combination of national anti-indigenous and anti-separatist political concerns with donor-led interventions that result in limited localisation and reduced effectiveness of HIV prevention measures. In West Papua, services are needed that enhance cooperation and shared commitment, and that acknowledge and work to overcome existing inequalities, ethnic tensions and discrimination in the health system. Beyond Indonesia, donor-led HIV programmes and interventions need to balance avoidance of politically sensitive issues with complicity in perpetuating health inequalities. Translating global health interventions and donor priorities into locally compelling HIV prevention activities involves more than navigating local cultural and religious beliefs. Programme development and implementation strategies that entail confronting structural questions as well as social hierarchies, cleavages and silences are needed to render more effective services; strategies that are inherently political.",eng,"Culture, health & sexuality",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Drivers for this disease vary by region and are not well understood for North African countries such as Egypt. A deeper understanding of RVF risk factors would inform disease management policies.--NEW SECTION--The present study employs mathematical and computational modeling techniques to ascertain the extent to which the severity of RVF epizootics in Egypt differs depending on the interaction between imported ruminant and environmentally-constrained mosquito populations.--NEW SECTION--An ordinary differential system of equations, a numerical model, and an individual-based model (IBM) were constructed to represent RVF disease dynamics between localized mosquitoes and ruminants being imported into Egypt for the Greater Bairam. Four cases, corresponding to the Greater Bairam's occurrence during distinct quarters of the solar year, were set up in both models to assess whether the different season-associated mosquito populations present during the Greater Bairam resulted in RVF epizootics of variable magnitudes.--NEW SECTION--The numerical model and the IBM produced nearly identical results: ruminant and mosquito population plots for both models were similar in shape and magnitude for all four cases. In both models, all four cases differed in the severity of their corresponding simulated RVF epizootics. The four cases, ranked by the severity of the simulated RVF epizootics in descending order, correspond with the occurrence of the Greater Bairam on the following months: July, October, April, and January. The numerical model was assessed for sensitivity with respect to parameter values and exhibited a high degree of robustness.--NEW SECTION--Limiting the importation of infected ruminants beginning one month prior to the Greater Bairam festival (on years in which the festival falls between the months of July and October: 2014-2022) might be a feasible way of mitigating future RVF epizootics in Egypt.",eng,Public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This type of emergence poses a vital challenge to control TB cases across the world. Mortality and morbidity rates are high due to this new face of TB. The newer nanotechnology-based drug-delivery approaches involving micro-metric and nano-metric carriers are much needed at this stage. These delivery systems would provide more advantages over conventional systems of treatment by producing enhanced therapeutic efficacy, uniform distribution of drug molecule to the target site, sustained and controlled release of drug molecules and lesser side effects. The main aim to develop these novel drug-delivery systems is to improve the patient compliance and reduce therapy time. This article reviews and elaborates the new concepts and drug-delivery approaches for the treatment of TB involving solid-lipid particulate drug-delivery systems (solid-lipid micro- and nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers), vesicular drug-delivery systems (liposomes, niosomes and liposphere), emulsion-based drug-delivery systems (micro and nanoemulsion) and some other novel drug-delivery systems for the effective treatment of tuberculosis and role of immunomodulators as an adjuvant therapy for management of MDR-TB and XDR-TB.",eng,Drug delivery,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

26282859,10.1093/heapol/czv035,The challenge of sustaining effectiveness over time: the case of the global network to stop tuberculosis.,"Where once global health decisions were largely the domain of national governments and the World Health Organization, today networks of international organizations, governments, private philanthropies and other entities are actively shaping public policy. However, there is still limited understanding of how global networks form, how they create institutions, how they promote and sustain collective action, and how they adapt to changes in the policy environment. Understanding these processes is crucial to understanding their effectiveness: whether and how global networks influence policy and public health outcomes. This study seeks to address these gaps through the examination of the global network to stop tuberculosis (TB) and the factors influencing its effectiveness over time. Drawing from ∼ 200 document sources and 16 interviews with key informants, we trace the development of the Global Partnership to Stop TB and its work over the past decade. We find that having a centralized core group and a strategic brand helped the network to coalesce around a primary intervention strategy, directly observed treatment short course. This strategy was created before the network was formalized, and helped bring in donors, ministries of health and other organizations committed to fighting TB-growing the network. Adaptations to this strategy, the creation of a consensus-based Global Plan, and the creation of a variety of participatory venues for discussion, helped to expand and sustain the network. Presently, however, tensions have become more apparent within the network as it struggles with changing internal political dynamics and the evolution of the disease. While centralization and stability helped to launch and grow the network, the institutionalization of governance and strategy may have constrained adaptation. Institutionalization and centralization may, therefore, facilitate short-term success for networks, but may end up complicating longer-term effectiveness.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26276763,10.1093/heapol/czu064,The global health network on alcohol control: successes and limits of evidence-based advocacy.,"Global efforts to address alcohol harm have significantly increased since the mid-1990 s. By 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) had adopted the non-binding Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol. This study investigates the role of a global health network, anchored by the Global Alcohol Policy Alliance (GAPA), which has used scientific evidence on harm and effective interventions to advocate for greater global public health efforts to reduce alcohol harm. The study uses process-tracing methodology and expert interviews to evaluate the accomplishments and limitations of this network. The study documents how network members have not only contributed to greater global awareness about alcohol harm, but also advanced a public health approach to addressing this issue at the global level. Although the current network represents an expanding global coalition of like-minded individuals, it faces considerable challenges in advancing its cause towards successful implementation of effective alcohol control policies across many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The analysis reveals a need to transform the network into a formal coalition of regional and national organizations that represent a broader variety of constituents, including the medical community, consumer groups and development-focused non-governmental organizations. Considering the growing harm of alcohol abuse in LMICs and the availability of proven and cost-effective public health interventions, alcohol control represents an excellent 'buy' for donors interested in addressing non-communicable diseases. Alcohol control has broad beneficial effects for human development, including promoting road safety and reducing domestic violence and health care costs across a wide variety of illnesses caused by alcohol consumption.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Hydroxyurea represents the only available disease-modifying therapy for SCA, and has proven safety and efficacy in high-resource countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, there is minimal use of hydroxyurea, due to lack of data, absence of evidence-based guidelines, and inexperience among healthcare providers.--NEW SECTION--A partnership was established between investigators in North America and sub-Saharan Africa, to develop a prospective multicenter research protocol designed to provide data on the safety, feasibility, and benefits of hydroxyurea for children with SCA.--NEW SECTION--The Realizing Effectiveness Across Continents with Hydroxyurea (REACH, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01966731) trial is a prospective, phase I/II open-label dose escalation study of hydroxyurea that will treat a total of 600 children age 1-10 years with SCA: 150 at each of four different clinical sites within sub-Saharan Africa (Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and Uganda).

26273062,10.1093/heapol/czu114,Agenda setting for maternal survival: the power of global health networks and norms.,"Nearly 300,000 women--almost all poor women in low-income countries--died from pregnancy-related complications in 2010. This represents a decline since the 1980s, when an estimated half million women died each year, but is still far higher than the aims set in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) at the turn of the century. The 1970s, 1980s and 1990 s witnessed a shift from near complete neglect of the issue to emergence of a network of individuals and organizations with a shared concern for reducing maternal deaths and growth in the number of organizations and governments with maternal health strategies and programmes. Maternal health experienced a marked change in agenda status in the 2000s, attracting significantly higher level attention (e.g. from world leaders) and greater resource commitments (e.g. as one issue addressed by US$40 billion in pledges to the 2010 Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health) than ever before. Several differences between network and actor features, issue characteristics and the policy environment pre- and post-2000 help to explain the change in agenda status for global maternal mortality reduction. Significantly, a strong poverty reduction norm emerged at the turn of the century; represented by the United Nations MDGs framework, the norm set unusually strong expectations for international development actors to advance included issues. As the norm grew, it drew policy attention to the maternal health goal (MDG 5). Seeking to advance the goals agenda, world leaders launched initiatives addressing maternal and child health. New network governance and framing strategies that closely linked maternal, newborn and child health shaped the initiatives. Diverse network composition--expanding beyond a relatively narrowly focused and technically oriented group to encompass allies and leaders that brought additional resources to bear on the problem--was crucial to maternal health's rise on the agenda in the 2000s.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Anosmin-1 (ANOS1) gene encodes a cell adhesion molecule that plays diverse roles in multiple malignancies. We performed global expression profiling of GC cell lines and small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments to determine the effect of ANOS1 expression on phenotype. We evaluated the association of ANOS1 mRNA and protein levels in patients' tissue and sera with clinicopathological factors of GC subtypes. Differential expression of ANOS1 mRNA by GC cell lines correlated positively to levels of ITGAV, FOXC2 and NODAL mRNAs and inversely with those of TFPI2. Inhibiting ANOS1 expression decreased the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells. The mean level of ANOS1 mRNA was significantly higher in 237 GC tissues compared with the corresponding noncancerous adjacent tissues. Elevated ANOS1 levels associated significantly with the phenotypes of GC, shorter disease-free and overall survival. ANOS1 expression was a more significant prognostic marker for diffuse and distal nondiffuse GC. ANOS1 concentrations in sera increased sequentially in sera of healthy subjects, localized GC and disseminated GCs. Prognosis was worse for patients with preoperative serum ANOS1 ≥ 600 pg/ml compared with those with <600 pg/ml.

It contributes to a growing ethnography on global health, biosociality, and patient-provider dynamics. Therapeutic citizenship is a biopolitical citizenship that includes claims and ethical projects that emerge from techniques to control and manage bodies. In some contexts, therapeutic citizenship has included activism and claims-making against local, national, and international power brokers. This article investigates therapeutic citizenship in the specific context of impoverished urban Zambian compounds, sites of food insecurity, unemployment, and political exclusion, as well as targets for donor, NGO, and faith-based organisation projects and PLHIV support group proliferation. The article utilises data from participant observations at two Lusaka AIDS clinics, interviews, and focused discussions with support groups of PLHIVs. It argues that PLHIVs continuously negotiate subjectivities related to kinship, clientship, religious belief, and political citizenship in processes that complicate therapeutic citizenship. Rather than fostering participation in PLHIV support groups or challenging 'politics as usual' through activist claims-making to institutions of biopower, these processes lead to therapeutic pacifism.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26253698,10.1093/heapol/czv001,From global agenda-setting to domestic implementation: successes and challenges of the global health network on tobacco control.,"Global policy attention to tobacco control has increased significantly since the 1990 s and culminated in the first international treaty negotiated under the auspices of the World Health Organization--the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Although the political process that led to the creation of the FCTC has been extensively researched, the FCTC's progression from an aspirational treaty towards a global health governance framework with tangible policy effects within FCTC member countries has not been well-understood to date. This article analyses the role of the global health network of tobacco control advocates and scientists, which formed during the FCTC negotiations during the late 1990 s, in translating countries' commitment to the FCTC into domestic policy change. By comparing the network's influence around two central tobacco control interventions (smoke-free environments and taxation), the study identifies several scope conditions, which have shaped the network's effectiveness around the FCTC's implementation: the complexity of the policy issue and the relative importance of non-health expertise, the required scope of domestic political buy-in, the role of the general public as network allies, and the strength of policy opposition. These political factors had a greater influence on the network's success than the evidence base for the effectiveness of tobacco control interventions. The network's variable success points to a trade-off faced by global health networks between their need to maintain internal cohesion and their ability to form alliances with actors in their social environment.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Building on our review of the existing measles and rubella health economics literature, we develop inputs for use in regional and global models of the expected future benefits and costs of vaccination, treatment, surveillance, and other global coordination activities. Given diversity in the world and limited data, we characterize the costs for countries according to the 2013 World Bank income levels using 2013 U.S. dollars (2013$US). We estimate that routine immunization and supplemental immunization activities will cost governments and donors over 2013$US 2.3 billion per year for the foreseeable future, with high-income countries accounting for 55% of the costs, to vaccinate global birth cohorts of approximately 134 million surviving infants and to protect the global population of over 7 billion people. We find significantly higher costs and health consequences of measles or rubella disease than with vaccine use, with the expected disability-adjusted life year (DALY) loss for case of disease generally at least 100 times the loss per vaccine dose. To support estimates of the economic benefits of investments in measles and/or rubella elimination or control, we characterize the probabilities of various sequelae of measles and rubella infections and vaccine adverse events, the DALY inputs for health outcomes, and the associated treatment costs. Managing measles and rubella to achieve the existing and future regional measles and rubella goals and the objectives of the Global Vaccine Action Plan will require an ongoing commitment of financial resources that will prevent adverse health outcomes and save the associated treatment costs.",eng,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Yet, despite high rates of interest among students and medical trainees to include global health opportunities in their training, there is still no clear understanding of how this interest will translate into viable and sustained global health careers after graduation. Building on a growing conversation about how to support careers in academic global health, this Perspective describes the practical challenges faced by physicians pursuing these careers after they complete training. Writing from their perspective as junior faculty at one U.S. academic health center with a dedicated focus on global health training, the authors describe a number of practical issues they have found to be critical both for their own career development and for the advice they provide their mentees. With a particular emphasis on the financial, personal, professional, and logistical challenges that young ""expat"" global health physicians in academic institutions face, they underscore the importance of finding ways to support these career paths, and propose possible solutions. Such investments would not only respond to the rational and moral imperatives of global health work and advance the mission of improving human health but also help to fully leverage the potential of what is already an unprecedented movement within academic medicine.",eng,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26243811,10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-052114,State-ownership of tobacco industry: a 'fundamental conflict of interest' or a 'tremendous opportunity' for tobacco control?,"Despite state-owned tobacco companies (SOTCs) accounting for over 40% of global production, the significance of state-ownership for tobacco control strategies has received limited academic and policy attention. The complex interests associated with SOTCs present diverse challenges for tobacco control policy, particularly in implementing Article 5.3 of WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Based on a review of existing literature, this paper examines current challenges and potential opportunities presented by governmental participation in the tobacco industry, identifying three contrasting perspectives from academic and policy sources. The first two perspectives centre on recognising that economic interests inherent in an SOTC are in tension with a government's public health responsibilities. This conflict can be perceived as either fundamental and fixed ('intrinsic conflict') or as amenable to either exacerbation or amelioration via organisational mechanisms ('institutionally-mediated conflict')-as suggested by the contrasting examples of China and Thailand. A third, less prominent perspective (which we refer to as 'interest alignment') suggests that it may be possible to radically alter the objectives and behaviour of SOTCs in order to advance tobacco control. Finally, we draw on this analysis to consider policy options for advancing tobacco control in countries with SOTCs. Guidance on implementation of Article 5.3 demonstrates strategic ambiguity by including elements of all three perspectives described above. We argue that legislative separation of tobacco control from SOTC oversight provides a desirable alternative to industry privatisation, and that radically realigning the goals of SOTCs to reduce tobacco consumption could make an important contribution to endgame strategies.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Mental health status was measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The QoL outcomes were assessed longitudinally using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38 questionnaires at the baseline and 6 months after diagnosis.--NEW SECTION--Of the 852 survivors who responded (94 %), 187 (22 %) had a type D personality. The proportion of patients with duration of symptoms >1 month and being diagnosed after emergency admissions in type D group is significantly higher than that in non-type D group. At both of the time points, type D patients reported statistically significant lower scores on most of the functional scales, global health status/QoL scales, and worse symptom scores compared to patients without a type D personality. At the 6-month time point, a higher percentage of patients in the type D group demonstrated QoL deterioration. Clinically elevated levels of anxiety and depression were more prevalent in type D than in non-type D survivors.--NEW SECTION--Type D personality was associated with poor QoL and mental health status among survivors of rectal cancer, even after adjustment for confounding background variables. Type D personality might be a general vulnerability factor to screen for subgroups at risk for longer symptom duration and emergency admissions in clinical practice.",eng,International journal of colorectal disease,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

HCV NS4B protein represents a validated target for the identification of new drugs to be added to the combination regimen recently approved. During the last years, NS4B has thus been the object of impressive medicinal chemistry efforts, which led to the identification of promising preclinical candidates. In this context, the present review aims to discuss research published on NS4B functional inhibitors focusing the attention on hit identification, hit-to-lead optimization, ADME profile evaluation, and the structure-activity relationship data raised for each compound family taken into account. The information delivered in this review will be a useful and valuable tool for those medicinal chemists dealing with research programs focused on NS4B and aimed at the identification of innovative anti-HCV compounds.",eng,Journal of medicinal chemistry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Using a primarily qualitative study design, we studied three experiences of mentorship and eight mentorship programmes for early career global health researchers based in high-income and low- and middle-income countries. For the latter, we drew upon programme materials, existing unpublished data and more formal mixed-method evaluations, supplemented by individual email questionnaire responses. Research team members wrote stories, and the team assembled and analysed them for key themes. Across the diverse experiences and programmes, key emergent themes included: great mentors inspire others in an inter-generational cascade, mentorship is transformative in personal and professional development and involves reciprocity, and finding the right balance in mentoring relationships and programmes includes responding creatively to failure. Among the challenges encountered were: struggling for more level playing fields for new health researchers globally, changing mindsets in institutions that do not have a culture of mentorship and building collaboration not competition. Mentoring networks spanning institutions and countries using multiple virtual and face-to-face methods are a potential avenue for fostering organisational cultures supporting quality mentorship in global health research.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells, and their activity is known to correlate to viral treatment response of HCV. In this study, we investigate the immune effects of viral load decline with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in blood.--NEW SECTION--Twelve patients with chronic HCV were treated with asunaprevir and daclatasvir, and peripheral blood was analyzed at various time points during therapy.--NEW SECTION--In line with previous studies, we confirmed restoration of HCV-specific T-cell frequency upon viral load decline. In addition, we show that serum interferon (IFN)-γ inducible-protein 10, interleukin (IL)-12p40, and IL-18 levels decreased early after start of therapy. Surface expression of activation receptors NKp30, NKp46, and inhibitory receptor NKG2A on blood NK cells reduced during therapy. In addition, the expression of TRAIL on NK cells was reduced during IFN-free therapy, suggesting a decrease in TRAIL-mediated killing by NK cells.--NEW SECTION--We show that viral load decline as a consequence of treatment with novel DAAs in chronic HCV patients reduces serum levels of NK cell-stimulating cytokines and causes correction of the altered NK cell phenotype observed in chronic HCV patients.--NEW SECTION--NCT02282709.",eng,The Journal of infectious diseases,Clinical Trial,2025-04-23,2016

These changes may be mediated by reduction in circulating proangiogenic and proinflammatory factors. In this first study of intravenous ω-3FAs as a therapy in cancer patients, we aimed to assess if it could augment the antitumor activity of gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and improve QOL.--NEW SECTION--Patients were administered gemcitabine 1000 mg/m3 weekly followed by up to 100 g (200 mg/mL) of ω-3 rich lipid emulsion for 3 weeks followed by a rest week. This was continued for up to 6 cycles, progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient request, or death. The primary outcome measure was objective response rate, with secondary outcome measures of overall and progression free survival, QOL scores, and adverse events.--NEW SECTION--Fifty patients were recruited. Response rate was 14.3% and disease control rate was 85.7%. Overall and progression free survival were 5.9 and 4.8 months, respectively. Increase in global health of > 10% over baseline was seen in 47.2% of patients. More than 50% of patients had > 10% increase in QOL scores in generic symptom scores and both disease-specific domains.

The reforms introduced by the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework are ill-suited to providing sufficient levels of access to vaccines to meet the needs of developing states, and as such developing states will continue to be reliant upon the traditional methods of vaccine procurement to procure the majority of the vaccines they required. Using procurement during 2009-H1N1 as a case study, this paper examines the methods of procurement utilised by states in order to determine if the procurement tools available to developing states are sufficient to procure adequate levels of pandemic influenza vaccines. Particular focus is given to the role Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs) play in the procurement process. By exploring this case study it is possible to argue that these procurement methods are ineffective for developing states, and when the next influenza pandemic occurs, demand will once again outstrip supply globally, due to supply of vaccines being dominated by the developed states with APAs in place.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Few studies have examined neighborhood perceptions related to walking and cycling for transport in different countries. Therefore, it is challenging to prioritize appropriate built-environment interventions.--NEW SECTION--The aim of this study was to examine the strength and shape of the relationship between adults' neighborhood perceptions and walking and cycling for transport across diverse environments.--NEW SECTION--As part of the International Physical activity and Environment Network (IPEN) adult project, self-reported data were taken from 13,745 adults (18-65 years) living in physically and socially diverse neighborhoods in 17 cities across 12 countries. Neighborhood perceptions were measured using the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale, and walking and cycling for transport were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form. Generalized additive mixed models were used to model walking or cycling for transport during the last seven days with neighborhood perceptions. Interactions by city were explored.--NEW SECTION--Walking-for-transport outcomes were significantly associated with perceived residential density, land use mix-access, street connectivity, aesthetics, and safety. Any cycling for transport was significantly related to perceived land use mix-access, street connectivity, infrastructure, aesthetics, safety, and perceived distance to destinations. Between-city differences existed for some attributes in relation to walking or cycling for transport.--NEW SECTION--Many perceived environmental attributes supported both cycling and walking; however, highly walkable environments may not support cycling for transport.

The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the associations between pretreatment QOL scores and survival or functional outcomes in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).--NEW SECTION--This prospective study enrolled a total of 141 patients with previously untreated HNSCC who underwent curative treatments from October 2010 to March 2012. Patients completed questionnaires on QOL including the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Core QOL questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EORTC QOL questionnaire Head and Neck Cancer module (QLQ-H&N35). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify QOL scores significantly associated with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and functional outcomes of gastrostomy or tracheostomy dependence.--NEW SECTION--The 2-year OS and DFS rates were 82.3 and 78.0%, respectively. The rates of gastrostomy and tracheostomy dependence were 9.2 and 14.9%, respectively. After controlling for clinical factors, specific QOL indices of 'dyspnea' (hazard ratio 1.023 [95% confidence interval 1.006-1.039]) and 'appetite loss' (1.020 [1.005-1.034]) were significantly associated with OS, while 'insomnia' (1.013 [1.002-1.025]) and 'appetite loss' (1.014 [1.001-1.026]) scores were significantly predictive of DFS (P < 0.05). Global health status score (0.967 [0.935-1.000]) and fatigue (1.048 [1.010-1.086]) were significantly associated with the dependence of tracheostomy (P < 0.05).

26153141,10.1002/wnan.1359,Engineering immunity in the mucosal niche against sexually transmitted infections.,"The mucosal surfaces of the genital tract are the site of entry to over 30 different bacterial, parasitic, and viral pathogens that are the cause of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. Women and adolescent girls are more severely impacted by STIs than men due in part to a greater biological susceptibility for acquiring infections and differences in disease sequelae. While it is widely accepted that preventative vaccines against the most commonly transmitted STIs would have a major impact on decreasing the global health burden of STIs for women worldwide, several challenges preclude their development. The female genital tract is a complex niche of microflora, hormonal influences, and immune tissues and cells that result in a mucosal immune system that is distinct from other mucosal sites and from our systemic immune system. An appreciation of these differences and their effect on shaping mucosal immunity to sexually transmitted pathogens is an important determinant for the design of effective STI vaccines. Here we describe the anatomy and mucosal immune system of the female reproductive tract, and discuss bioengineering strategies to design mucosal vaccines that overcome delivery challenges and coordinate the presentation kinetics and compartmentalization of antigens and adjuvants to relevant mucosal immune cell subsets. In particular, we describe recent progress in understanding the role of specific mucosal dendritic cell subsets in facilitating immune responses to pathogenic microbes in the genital mucosa. We also discuss the development of pathogen-mimicking materials that may be useful for engineering protective immunity in this mucosal niche.",eng,Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

With its proposed strategy, the UN follows leading scientists who had declared the failure of former prevention strategies and now were promoting a 'Seek and Treat for Optimal Prevention' (STOP) approach as the most cost-effective response to the pandemic to meet the goal of 'an AIDS-free generation'. STOP combines antiretroviral therapy and routine HIV screening to find persons unaware that they are HIV-positive, because research has shown that people consistently change their behaviour (i.e. increase condom use, have fewer partners) after an HIV diagnosis. AIDS activists have broadly criticized this strategy on different levels. In this article, we go beyond these criticisms and try to analyse the political rationalities behind this 'new' strategy. We believe that it is necessary to put the rationale underpinning the STOP programme into the context of broader societal transformations that can best be captured as the development of advanced liberal societies and the new emphasis on self-controlling or self-responsibility rather than on disciplining behaviour.",eng,Nursing inquiry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This study evaluates the change of HIV/AIDS mortality rates in Asian and North African countries from 1990 to 2010 using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. HIV/AIDS mortality rates were derived from the GBD database from 1990 to 2010, for 52 countries in Asia and North Africa. First, a Latent Growth Model was employed to assess the change in AIDS mortality rate over time in six different regions of Asia, and also the change in AIDS mortality rate over time for males and females in Asia and North Africa. Finally, Latent Growth Mixture Models (LGMMs) were applied to identify distinct groups in which countries within each group have similar trends over time. Our results showed that increase in mortality rate over time for males is about three times greater than for females. The highest and lowest trend of AIDS mortality rates were observed in South-East Asia and high-income Asia-Pacific regions, respectively. The LGMM allocated most countries in the South and South-East region into two classes with the highest trend of AIDS mortality rates. Although the HIV/AIDS mortality rates are decreasing in some countries and clusters, the general trend in the Asian continent is upwards. Therefore, it is necessary to provide programmes to achieve the goal of access to HIV prevention measures, treatment, care, and support for high-risk groups, especially in countries with a higher trend of AIDS mortality rates.",eng,Epidemiology and infection,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

There were reports of severe hypotension and increased infection rates with barbiturate-based therapy. Etomidate-based suppressive therapy was linked to severe renal dysfunction.--NEW SECTION--There currently exists both Oxford level 2b and GRADE C evidence to support that achieving burst suppression reduces ICP, and also has no effect on ICP, in severe traumatic brain injury. The literature suggests burst suppression therapy may be useful for ICP reduction in certain cases, although these situations are currently unclear. In addition, the impact on patient functional outcome is unclear. Further prospective study is warranted.",eng,Journal of intensive care medicine,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2017

This paper examines the logic used by government officials to justify investment incentives to increase tobacco processing and manufacturing in the context of FCTC implementation in Zambia.--NEW SECTION--We conducted qualitative semistructured interviews with key informants from government, civil society and intergovernmental economic organisations (n=23). We supplemented the interview data with an analysis of public documents pertaining to the policy of economic development in Zambia.--NEW SECTION--We found gross misalignments between the policies of the economic sector and efforts to implement the provisions of the FCTC. Our interviews uncovered the rationale used by officials in the economic sector to justify providing economic incentives to bolster tobacco processing and manufacturing in Zambia: (1) tobacco is not consumed by Zambians/tobacco is an export commodity, (2) economic benefits outweigh health costs and (3) tobacco consumption is a personal choice.--NEW SECTION--Much of the struggle Zambia has experienced in implementing the FCTC can be attributed to misalignments between the economic and health sectors. Zambia's development agenda seeks to bolster agricultural processing and manufacturing. Tobacco control proponents must recognise and work within this context in order to foster productive strategies with those working on tobacco supply issues. These findings are broadly applicable to the global context. It is important that the Ministry of Health monitors the tobacco policy of and engages with these sectors to find ways of harmonising FCTC implementation.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Service provision in a community is often disjointed among a variety of providers. We sought to reduce unmet patient needs by increasing referral coordination for HIV and family planning, measured as network density, with an organizational network approach.--NEW SECTION--We conducted organizational network analysis on two networks in sub-cities of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. There were 25 organizations in one sub-city network and 26 in the other. In one of them we sought to increase referrals through three network strengthening meetings. We then conducted the network analysis again in both sub-cities to measure any changes since baseline. We also quantitatively measured reported client service needs in both sub-cities before and after the intervention with two cross-sectional samples of face-to-face interviews with clients (459 at baseline and 587 at follow-up).--NEW SECTION--In the sub-city with the intervention, the number of referral connections between organizations, measured as network density, increased 55%. In the control community, the density decreased over the same period. Reported unmet client service needs declined more consistently across services in the intervention community.--NEW SECTION--This quasi experiment demonstrated that (1) an organizational network analysis can inform an intervention, (2) a modest network strengthening intervention can enhance client referrals in the network, (3) improvement in client referrals was accompanied by a decrease in atient-reported unmet needs and (4) a series of network analyses can be a useful evaluation tool.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

How Religiosity Predicts Atheists' Health.,"The relationship between atheism and health is poorly understood within the Religion/Spirituality-health literature. While the extant literature promotes the idea that Attendance, Prayer, and Religiosity are connected to positive health outcomes, these relationships have not been established when controlling for whether a person is an atheist. Data from the 2008-2012 American General Social Survey (n = 3210) were used to investigate this relationship. Results indicated that atheists experienced Religiosity more negatively than non-atheists. Additionally, results demonstrated that non-belief in God was not related to better or worse perceived global health, suggesting that belief in God is not inherently linked to better reported health.",eng,Journal of religion and health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26110794,10.1111/tct.12349,'Disaster day': global health simulation teaching.,"As society diversifies and globalisation quickens, the importance of teaching global health to medical undergraduates increases. For undergraduates, the majority of exposure to 'hands-on' teaching on global health occurs during optional elective periods. This article describes an innovative student-led initiative, 'Disaster Day', which used simulation to teach global health to undergraduates.--NEW SECTION--The teaching day began with an introduction outlining the work of Médecins Sans Frontières and the basic principles of resuscitation. Students then undertook four interactive simulation scenarios: Infectious Diseases in a Refugee Camp, Natural Disaster and Crush Injury, Obstetric Emergency in a Low-Income Country, and Warzone Gunshot Wound. Sessions were facilitated by experienced doctors and fourth-year students who had been trained in the delivery of the scenarios. Students completed pre- and post-session evaluation forms that included the self-rating of confidence in eight learning domains (using a five-point Likert scale).--NEW SECTION--Twenty-seven students voluntarily attended the session, and all provided written feedback. Analysis of the pre- and post-session evaluations demonstrated statistically significant improvements in confidence across all but one domains (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Free-text feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with students appreciating the practical aspect of the scenarios. For undergraduates, the majority of exposure to 'hands-on' teaching on global health occurs during optional elective periods--NEW SECTION--Simulation-based teaching can provide students with 'hands-on' exposure to global health in a controlled, reproducible fashion and appears to help develop their confidence in a variety of learning domains. The more widespread use of such teaching methods is encouraged: helping tomorrow's doctors develop insight into global health challenges may produce more rounded clinicians capable of caring for more culturally diverse populations.",eng,The clinical teacher,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

After a 21-day titration (maximum twice-daily doses: tapentadol PR 250 mg, or oxycodone/naloxone PR 40 mg/20 mg plus oxycodone PR 10 mg), target doses were continued for 9 weeks. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the change in NRS-3 from baseline to final evaluation; the exact repeated confidence interval (RCI) for tapentadol PR minus oxycodone/naloxone PR was used to establish noninferiority (upper limit <1.3) and superiority (confirmatory analyses).--NEW SECTION--For the primary effectiveness endpoint, tapentadol PR was noninferior to oxycodone/naloxone PR (97.5% RCI: [-1.820, -0.184]; P < 0.001). This exact RCI also yielded evidence of superiority for tapentadol PR vs. oxycodone/naloxone PR (significantly greater reduction in pain intensity; P = 0.003). Improvements (baseline to final evaluation) in painDETECT and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory scores were significantly greater with tapentadol PR vs. oxycodone/naloxone PR (all P ≤ 0.005).--NEW SECTION--The study was formally shown to be positive and demonstrated, in the primary effectiveness endpoint, the noninferiority for tapentadol PR vs. oxycodone/naloxone PR. The effectiveness of tapentadol PR was superior to that of oxycodone/naloxone PR by means of clinical relevance and statistical significance (confirmatory evidence of superiority). Tapentadol PR was associated with significantly greater improvements in neuropathic pain-related symptoms and global health status than oxycodone/naloxone PR and with a significantly better gastrointestinal tolerability profile. Tapentadol PR may be considered a first-line option for managing severe chronic low back pain with a neuropathic pain component.",eng,Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,"Clinical Trial, Phase III",2025-04-23,2016
26081904,10.1007/s11517-015-1323-6,RAIRS2 a new expert system for diagnosing tuberculosis with real-world tournament selection mechanism inside artificial immune recognition system.,"Tuberculosis is a major global health problem that has been ranked as the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide, after the human immunodeficiency virus. Diagnosis based on cultured specimens is the reference standard; however, results take weeks to obtain. Slow and insensitive diagnostic methods hampered the global control of tuberculosis, and scientists are looking for early detection strategies, which remain the foundation of tuberculosis control. Consequently, there is a need to develop an expert system that helps medical professionals to accurately diagnose the disease. The objective of this study is to diagnose tuberculosis using a machine learning method. Artificial immune recognition system (AIRS) has been used successfully for diagnosing various diseases. However, little effort has been undertaken to improve its classification accuracy. In order to increase the classification accuracy, this study introduces a new hybrid system that incorporates real tournament selection mechanism into the AIRS. This mechanism is used to control the population size of the model and to overcome the existing selection pressure. Patient epacris reports obtained from the Pasteur laboratory in northern Iran were used as the benchmark data set. The sample consisted of 175 records, from which 114 (65 %) were positive for TB, and the remaining 61 (35 %) were negative. The classification performance was measured through tenfold cross-validation, root-mean-square error, sensitivity, and specificity. With an accuracy of 100 %, RMSE of 0, sensitivity of 100 %, and specificity of 100 %, the proposed method was able to successfully classify tuberculosis cases. In addition, the proposed method is comparable with top classifiers used in this research.",eng,Medical & biological engineering & computing,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
26080365,10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2015-052334,Application of the Abridged SimSmoke model to four Eastern Mediterranean countries.,"The WHO established the MPOWER policy package to boost the implementation of the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in 2008 and to provide practical guidance on policies effective at reducing smoking rates. An easily applied Abridged SimSmoke was developed to help countries gauge the effect of these policies using data from the WHO MPOWER/WHO Report (MPOWER Report) and is applied to four Eastern Mediterranean countries.--NEW SECTION--The number of smokers in a country is calculated using the country's smoking prevalence and population. Policy effect sizes, based on previously validated SimSmoke models, are applied to the smoker populations to determine the reduction in the number of smokers resulting from implementing policies. The number of smoking-attributable deaths is derived based on findings that half of those smokers alive today will die from smoking.--NEW SECTION--Within 40 years, implementing the complete set of MPOWER policies is projected to reduce smoking prevalence by 29% (range 15%, 41%) and avert almost 1 (range 0.5, 1.4) million deaths in Egypt, reduce smoking prevalence by 52% (range 36%, 66%) and avert 156 000 (106 000, 196 000) deaths in Lebanon, reduce smoking prevalence by 56% (range 40%, 69%) and avert 3.5 (range 2.5, 4.3) million deaths in Pakistan, and reduce smoking prevalence by 37% (range 21%, 51%) and avert 245 000 (range 138 000, 334 000) deaths in Tunisia.--NEW SECTION--The Abridged SimSmoke model has been used to show the number of deaths from smoking and how MPOWER policies can be used to reach the WHO non-communicable deaths voluntary target for cigarette use reduction in four countries.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Aim of this study is to evaluate the short- and medium-term quality of life (QoL) from a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in patients with iT2-iT3 N0-N+ rectal cancer, who underwent ELRR by TEM or LTME after neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (n-RCT).--NEW SECTION--Thirty patients with iT2-iT3 rectal cancer who underwent ELRR by TEM (n = 15) or LTME (n = 15) were enrolled in this study. The choice for one operation or the other was made on the basis of predefined criteria. QoL was evaluated by EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38 questionnaires at admission, after n-RCT and 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery.--NEW SECTION--No statistically significant differences in QoL evaluation were observed between the two groups, both at admission and after n-RCT. At 1 month after surgery, significantly better results in the ELRR group were observed by QLQ-C30 in: Nausea/Vomiting (p = 0.05), Appetite Loss (p = 0.003), Constipation (p = 0.05), and by QLQ-CR38 in: Body Image (p = 0.05), Sexual Functioning (p = 0.03), Future Perspective (p = 0.05) and Weight Loss (p = 0.036). At 6 months after surgery, a statistically significant worse impact after LTME was observed by QLQ-C30 in: Global Health Status (p = 0.05), Emotional Functioning (p = 0.021), Dyspnea (p = 0.008), Insomnia (p = 0.012), Appetite Loss (p = 0.014) and by QLQ-CR38 in Body Image (p = 0.05) and Defecation Problems (p = 0.001).

The Congo Red Dot (CRD) test, a simple modality to assess the presence of misfolded proteins in urine, shows promise as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for preeclampsia. We propose an innovative mobile health (mHealth) solution that enables the quantification of the CRD test as a batch laboratory test, with minimal cost and equipment.--NEW SECTION--A smartphone application that guides the user through seven easy steps, and that can be used successfully by non-specialized personnel, was developed. After image acquisition, a robust analysis runs on a smartphone, quantifying the CRD test response without the need for an internet connection or additional hardware. In the first stage, the basic image processing algorithms and supporting test standardizations were developed using urine samples from 218 patients. In the second stage, the standardized procedure was evaluated on 328 urine specimens from 273 women. In the third stage, the application was tested for robustness using four different operators and 94 altered samples.--NEW SECTION--In the first stage, the image processing chain was set up with high correlation to manual analysis (z-test P < 0.001). In the second stage, a high agreement between manual and automated processing was calculated (Lin's concordance coefficient ρc = 0.968). In the last stage, sources of error were identified and remedies were developed accordingly. Altered samples resulted in an acceptable concordance with the manual gold-standard (Lin's ρc = 0.914).--NEW SECTION--Combining smartphone-based image analysis with molecular-specific disease features represents a cost-effective application of mHealth that has the potential to fill gaps in access to health care solutions that are critical to reducing adverse events in resource-poor settings.",eng,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We sought to investigate SMA behaviors and risk factors among Chinese university students, and further explore the association between SMA practices and adverse drug events (ADEs).--NEW SECTION--Cross-sectional study.--NEW SECTION--An online survey was conducted at Jiangsu University (JSU) in eastern China in July 2011 using a pretested questionnaire.--NEW SECTION--Out of 2608 website visitors, 1086 participated in the survey (response rate: 41.6%), 426 respondents were excluded for not being a JSU student or repeat participation, 660 (2.2% of JSU students) were included in analysis, and 316 students (47.9%) had a lifetime history of SMA. Among self-treated students, 43.5% believed that antibiotic was suitable for viral infections, 65.9% had more than one SMA episode in the previous year, 73.5% self-medicated with at least two different antibiotics, 57.1% and 64.4% changed antibiotic dosage and antibiotics during the course, respectively. Female gender, older age, and prior knowledge of antibiotics (PKA) were identified as independent risk factors of SMA. There was no difference between students with and without PKA regarding SMA frequency, use of polyantibiotics, and switching antibiotic dosage or antibiotics. ADEs happened to 13.3% of self-medicated students. Frequent change of dosage and simultaneous use of the same antibiotic with different names were independent risk practices associated with an ADE.--NEW SECTION--Our findings substantiate high SMA prevalence among Chinese university students. Older age and PKA are independent SMA risk factors common to Chinese university students and female gender is exclusive SMA risk factor for JSU students. Poor SMA practices are associated with ADEs.

Body image problems are distressing and may further exacerbate sexual difficulties, particularly for women. This preliminary study sought to (1) describe body image problems, including sociodemographic and disease/treatment correlates, and (2) examine relations between body image and sexual function.--NEW SECTION--For the baseline assessment of a larger study, 70 women completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire and Colorectal Cancer-specific Module, including the Body Image subscale, and Female Sexual Function Index. Pearson's correlation and multiple regression evaluated correlates of body image. Among sexually active women (n = 41), hierarchical regression examined relations between body image and sexual function domains.--NEW SECTION--Women were on average 55 years old (standard deviation = 11.6), non-Hispanic White (79%), married (57%), and employed (47%). The majority (86%) reported at least one body image problem. Younger age, lower global health status, and greater severity of symptoms related to poorer body image (p's < 0.05). Poor body image was inversely related to all aspects of sexual function (β range 0.50-0.70, p's < 0.05), except pain. The strongest association was with Female Sexual Function Index Sexual/Relationship Satisfaction.--NEW SECTION--These preliminary findings suggest the importance of assessing body image as a potentially modifiable target to address sexual difficulties in this understudied group.

Influenced by ideas of time-space compression, the global health literature argues that the world is characterised by a convergence of disease patterns and biomedical knowledge. While not denying the influence of these temporalities and spatialities of globalisation within the global health and chronic disease field, the article argues that they sit alongside other, often-conflicting notions of time and space. To do so, it explores the spatio-temporal logics that underpin a highly influential epidemiological model of the smoking epidemic. Unlike the temporalities and spatialities of sameness described in much of the global health literature, the article shows that this model is articulated around temporalities and spatialities of difference. This is not the difference celebrated by postmoderns, but the difference of modernisation theorists built around nations, sequential stages and progress. Indeed, the model, in stark contrast to the 'one world, one time, one health' globalisation mantra, divides the world into nation-states and orders them along epidemiological, geographical and development lines.",eng,Health & place,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

25934651,10.1177/1363461515581543,For lack of wanting: Discourses of desire in Ukrainian opiate substitution therapy programs.,"Available treatments for addiction and substance abuse in Ukraine have been shaped by the economic, political, and social shifts that have followed the country's independence. The introduction of methadone-based opiate substitution therapy (OST) for opiate addicts is especially representative of this. Biomedical paradigms of addiction, its etiology, and its treatment, promoted and paid for by international donors and elite global health entities, are being met by Ukrainian notions of personhood and psychology in both public discourse and clinical settings. Ukrainian physicians who work in OST programs frequently reference desire (желание) as the most significant factor in determining the success or failure of treatment. They refer to a desire to be treated, desire to get better, desire to live. The moralized imperative to possess this desire to get better is, in many ways, a reflection of how addiction and the addicted psyche is constructed and understood in the Ukrainian context. By exploring discourses of desire in narratives of addiction and treatment, I examine how notions of psychology, will, and self-control intersect, shaping the subjectivity, agency, and daily experiences of this vulnerable population.",eng,Transcultural psychiatry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

As evidence, I outline two very different health programs in the Somali Region of Ethiopia, and how, in each, existing animosities and political grievances were either reinforced or undermined. I argue that the provision of health care in politically insecure and post-conflict settings like the Somali Region of Ethiopia is precarious but pivotal: medical encounters have the potential to either worsen the conditions in which conflicts and crises recur, or build new interpersonal and governmental relations of trust. Effective global health diplomacy, therefore, cannot be limited to building clinics and donating medicine, but must also explicitly include building positive relationships of trust between oppositional groups within clinical spaces.",eng,"Culture, medicine and psychiatry",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We explored agency as a practical and theoretical construct through qualitative research among 20 nurses with direct or indirect experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Johannesburg. Interviews conducted from August 2013 to March 2014 generated rich descriptions from respondents in five health facilities. Nurses' self-reported IPV matched national prevalence of 24-31%. Findings revealed the way in which agency is enacted by nurses, allowing them the economic means to leave abusive partnerships, yet disabling them from agency and health promotion in their workplace. At the same time, nurses expanded agentic possibilities for patients by enabling a national response to IPV within South African health clinics - one that is largely undocumented. We posit that nurses can serve as important agentic actors in public health systems in low- and middle-income country settings by assisting patients to address IPV, even in the absence of targeted training and guidelines. To ensure the health and well-being of women experiencing IPV, nurses should be supported by the health sector to respond skilfully to patients and to safely process their own experiences of violence.",eng,Global public health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A wide range of institutions are addressing the challenges, but there is limited reflection and evaluation on the various approaches, how they compare with each other, and conclusions regarding the most effective approach for particular settings. This article presents a framework for global mental health capacity building that could potentially serve as a promising or best practice in the field. The framework is the outcome of a decade of collaborative global health work at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) (Ontario, Canada). The framework is grounded in scientific evidence, relevant learning and behavioural theories and the underlying principles of health equity and human rights.--NEW SECTION--Grounded in CAMH's research, programme evaluation and practical experience in developing and implementing mental health capacity building interventions, this article presents the iterative learning process and impetus that formed the basis of the framework. A developmental evaluation (Patton M.2010. Developmental Evaluation: Applying Complexity Concepts to Enhance Innovation and Use. New York: Guilford Press.) approach was used to build the framework, as global mental health collaboration occurs in complex or uncertain environments and evolving learning systems.--NEW SECTION--A multilevel framework consists of five central components: (1) holistic health, (2) cultural and socioeconomic relevance, (3) partnerships, (4) collaborative action-based education and learning and (5) sustainability. The framework's practical application is illustrated through the presentation of three international case studies and four policy implications. Lessons learned, limitations and future opportunities are also discussed.--NEW SECTION--The holistic policy and intervention framework for global mental health reflects an iterative learning process that can be applied and scaled up across different settings through appropriate modifications.",eng,Health policy and planning,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

We undertook a systematic narrative review of the literature to ascertain to what extent there is evidence of similar inequalities in the subjective health and well-being of older people in Europe.--NEW SECTION--Relevant original research articles were searched for using Medline, Global Health, Embase, Social Policy and Practice, Cinahl, Web of Science and International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS). We included studies of SEP and indicators of subjective health and well-being (self-rated health; life satisfaction; quality of life) conducted since 1991 using population-based samples of older people in Europe and published 1995-2013.--NEW SECTION--A total of 71 studies were identified. Poorer SEP was associated with poorer subjective health and well-being. Associations varied somewhat depending on the SEP measure and subjective health and well-being outcome used. Associations were weaker when social support and health-related behaviours were adjusted for suggesting that these factors mediate the relationship between SEP and subjective health and well-being. Associations tended to be weaker in the oldest age groups. The patterns of associations by gender were not consistent and tended to diminish after adjusting for indicators of health and life circumstances.--NEW SECTION--The results of this systematic narrative review of the literature demonstrate the importance of social influences on later life subjective health and well-being and indicate areas which need further investigation, such as more studies from Eastern Europe, more longitudinal studies and more research on the role of mediating factors.",eng,Aging & mental health,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Considering context and the interplay of individual, organizational, and societal influences on the experience of volunteers, this paper addresses three questions: What do grassroots volunteers contribute? What organizational processes promote volunteer engagement? What are the positive and negative consequences of volunteering? Eighteen members and staff of the Tanzanian HIV and AIDS NGO, KIWAKKUKI, were selected from 6000+ women volunteers to be interviewed. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes. Within KIWAKKUKI, volunteers contributed time and local knowledge, leading to an indigenous educational approach building on local norms and customs. Volunteers' engagement was motivated by the desire to support family members, reverse stigma, and work/socialize with other women. Benefits to volunteers included skills acquisition and community recognition; yet some volunteers also reported negative experiences including burnout, conferred stigma, and domestic violence. Positive organizational processes built on cultural practices such as collective decision-making and singing. The findings point to important considerations about context, including the synergistic effect training can have on local traditions of caring, complications of gender inequity, and how community health planning processes may need to be modified in extremely poor settings. This research also suggests good utility of the research framework (the Bergen Model of Collaborative Functioning) that was used to analyze volunteer engagement for service delivery in sub-Saharan contexts.",eng,Global health promotion,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Prior research using data from married individuals has yielded inconsistent findings regarding the association between positive marital quality and global health outcomes. The present study involved married couples to examine how spouses' positive marital quality affect their own and each other's health, and whether these effects vary by age.--NEW SECTION--Using data from 3 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (2006, 2008, 2010), we estimated a series of actor-partner interdependence models using mixed linear models.--NEW SECTION--Analyses found that over the 4-year period (2006-2010) increases in positive marital quality of both spouses were independently associated with increases in their self-rated health in midlife and old age as well as with declines in disability in old age. Increases in positive marital quality were also linked with declines in functional limitations for middle-aged and older adults.--NEW SECTION--Being perceived as a supportive spouse, as well as perceiving one's partner as such, has significant health implications. Overall, positive marital quality of both spouses contributes to health protection for middle-aged and older spouses.",eng,"The journals of gerontology.

This program is designed for MPH and Ph.D. students in cancer epidemiology and related disciplines, in international and minority settings (special populations) in a recent 7-year period. Positive short-term outcome of 73 students was measured as publishing a manuscript from the field research data and having a job in special populations. Positive long-term outcome was measured as having a post-doc position, being in a doctoral program, and/or employment in special populations at least 3 years from finishing the program. Significant factors associated with both short- and long-term success included resourcefulness of the student and compatibility of personalities and interests between the student and the on-campus and off-campus mentors. Short-term-success of students who conducted international filed research was associated with visits of the on-campus mentor to the field site. Short-term success was also associated with extent of mentorship in the field site and with long-term success. Future studies should investigate how field research sites could enhance careers of students, appropriateness of the sites for specific training competencies, and how to maximize the learning experience of students in international and minority research sites.",eng,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

25680362,10.1093/heapro/dav003,A community-engaged infection prevention and control approach to Ebola.,"The real missing link in Ebola control efforts to date may lie in the failure to apply core principles of health promotion: the early, active and sustained engagement of affected communities, their trusted leaders, networks and lay knowledge, to help inform what local control teams do, and how they may better do it, in partnership with communities. The predominant focus on viral transmission has inadvertently stigmatized and created fear-driven responses among affected individuals, families and communities. While rigorous adherence to standard infection prevention and control (IPC) precautions and safety standards for Ebola is critical, we may be more successful if we validate and combine local community knowledge and experiences with that of IPC medical teams. In an environment of trust, community partners can help us learn of modest adjustments that would not compromise safety but could improve community understanding of, and responses to, disease control protocol, so that it better reflects their 'community protocol' (local customs, beliefs, knowledge and practices) and concerns. Drawing on the experience of local experts in several African nations and of community-engaged health promotion leaders in the USA, Canada and WHO, we present an eight step model, from entering communities with cultural humility, though reciprocal learning and trust, multi-method communication, development of the joint protocol, to assessing progress and outcomes and building for sustainability.

Country-specific weighted average prices (WAP) per 1000 cigarettes (as of 1 July 2012) were obtained from the European Commission, and divided by 50 to yield WAP per cigarette pack. The dispersion in EU cigarette prices was measured with the coefficient of variation. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to measure the relationship between EU-wide cigarette price differential and cross-border tobacco purchasing because of cheaper price among current cigarette smokers (n=6896).--NEW SECTION--The coefficient of variation for cigarette WAP within the EU was 0.39 (mean price=€3.99/pack). Of all current cigarette smokers in the EU, 26.2% (27.5 million persons) engaged in a cross-border tobacco purchase within the past 12 months, of which 56.3% did so because of cheaper price in another country. EU-wide cigarette price differential was significantly associated with making a cross-border tobacco purchase because of cheaper price (adjusted OR=1.34; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.47).--NEW SECTION--Reducing differences in cigarette tax and price within the EU, coupled with a stricter limitation on the quantity of cigarettes that it is possible to carry from one Member State to another, may help reduce cross-border tax avoidance strategies.",eng,Tobacco control,Comparative Study,2025-04-23,2016

Anthropological approaches to vaccination, which counter stereotypes of ""ignorant"" publics needing education to accept vaccination, excavate alternative ways of knowing about illness and vaccination. We build on these approaches, evaluating different kinds of incertitude (ambiguity, uncertainty, ignorance) about infancy, HBV, health protection, and vaccination. Using interviews and participant observation, we find that Bangui and Cascades publics framed their incertitude differently through stories of infancy, illness, and protection. We locate different forms of incertitude within their historical contexts to illuminate why vaccination practices differ in the Cascades region and Bangui. A more nuanced approach to incomplete knowledge, situated in political, economic, and social histories of the state and vaccination, can contribute to more appropriate global health strategies to improve HBV prevention.",eng,Medical anthropology quarterly,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The adenosine 2A (A2 A ) receptor presents a potential therapeutic target for METH abuse due to its modulatory effects on striatal dopamine and glutamate transmission. Notably, A2 A receptor signalling has been implicated in the rewarding effects of alcohol, cocaine and opiates; yet, the role of this receptor in METH consumption and seeking is essentially unknown. Therefore, the current study used A2 A knockout (KO) mice to assess the role of A2 A in behaviours relevant to METH addiction. METH conditioned place preference was absent in A2 A KO mice compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. Repeated METH treatment produced locomotor sensitization in both genotypes; however, sensitization was attenuated in A2 A KO mice in a dose-related manner. METH intravenous self-administration was intact in A2 A KO mice over a range of doses and schedules of reinforcement. However, the motivation to self-administer was reduced in A2 A KO mice. Regression analysis further supported the observation that the motivation to self-administer METH was reduced in A2 A KO mice even when self-administration was similar to WT mice. Sucrose self-administration was also reduced in A2 A KO mice but only at higher schedules of reinforcement. Collectively, these data suggest that A2 A signalling is critically required to integrate rewarding and motivational properties of both METH and natural rewards.",eng,Addiction biology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Following the 2009/2010 HWL changes in Uruguay (from 50% to 80% in size), all indicators of HWL effectiveness increased significantly (noticing HWLs: OR=1.44, p=0.015; reading HWLs: OR=1.42, p=0.002; impact of HWLs on thinking about risks of smoking: OR=1.66, p<0.001; HWLs increasing thinking about quitting: OR=1.76, p<0.001; avoiding looking at the HWLs: OR=2.35, p<0.001; and reports that HWLs stopped smokers from having a cigarette 'many times': OR=3.42, p<0.001).--NEW SECTION--The 2009/2010 changes to HWLs in Uruguay, including a substantial increment in size, led to increases of key HWL indicators, thus supporting the conclusion that enhancing HWLs beyond minimum guideline recommendations can lead to even higher levels of effectiveness.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
25401489,10.1111/crj.12242,Clinical features and treatment of drug fever caused by anti-tuberculosis drugs.,"Tuberculosis is a major global health problem. However, anti-tuberculosis drug treatment has many adverse effects, such as drug-caused fever. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and treatments of anti-tuberculosis drugs-induced fever.--NEW SECTION--A total of 78 inpatients and outpatients with pulmonary tuberculosis accompanied by drug fever during the anti-tuberculosis treatment were analysed retrospectively from April 2006 to March 2013.--NEW SECTION--Among the anti-tuberculosis drugs that caused the drug fever, rifampicin was the most common one, followed by para-aminosalicylic and pyrazinamide. The symptoms occurred within 2 months after treatment, mainly in the 1-3 weeks, and the main symptom was high fever with body temperature above 39°C. The accompanying symptoms include rash, chills, headache, stuffy nose, runny nose, nausea, vomiting and joint pain. Routine blood examination found that eosinophilia increased in 15 cases and decreased in another 15. Among 63 patients who underwent liver function tests, there were 10 cases of abnormal function and 4 cases of liver damage. When the drug fever was suspected, the measure of withdrawal was taken first. All the suspected drugs were withdrawn in 59 cases, while gradual withdrawal was conducted in 19 cases. Patients with complications were first treated in accordance with the principles of complications treatment and then were gradually given some drugs after recovery. The patients without complications were gradually given some drugs after the body temperature was back to normal.--NEW SECTION--Drug fever is an allergic reaction, the resolution of which depends on whether it was accompanied by liver damage and/or rash or not.",eng,The clinical respiratory journal,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Trichomoniasis is a widespread, global health concern and occurring at an increasing rate. Infections of the female genital tract can cause a range of symptoms, including vaginitis and cervicitis, while infections in males are generally asymptomatic. The relatively mild symptoms, and lack of evidence for any serious sequelae, have historically led to this disease being under diagnosed, and under researched. However, growing evidence that T. vaginalis infection is associated with other disease states with high morbidity in both men and women has increased the efforts to diagnose and treat patients harboring this parasite. The pathology of trichomoniasis results from damage to the host epithelia, caused by a variety of processes during infection and recent work has highlighted the complex interactions between the parasite and host, commensal microbiome and accompanying symbionts. The commercial release of a number of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) has added to the available diagnostic options. Immunoassay based Point of Care testing is currently available, and a recent initial evaluation of a NAAT Point of Care system has given promising results, which would enable testing and treatment in a single visit.",eng,Critical reviews in microbiology,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

This article provides an overview of an under-reported and understudied ATP, dokha, which is smoked in a midwakh pipe. It describes the state of tobacco control in the Arabian Gulf region where midwakh smoking appears to be most common, the history of midwakh and dokha use, and what is known about midwakh smoking from the published literature. On the basis of the stark lack of data on midwakh use, we suggest priority areas to focus future research. Preliminary data and observations from health providers and the public health sector suggest that midwakh smoking may pose challenges to the tobacco control efforts in the Arabian Gulf region. If it is emerging as a new ATP outside this region, there could be a significant impact on tobacco control strategies globally.",eng,Tobacco control,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

The fellowship is jointly supported by the department of pediatrics, section of pediatric emergency medicine (PEM), and the hospital. Fellows complete all requirements for the PEM fellowship and Global Health, the latter requiring an additional 12 months of training. Components of the Global Health fellowship include international fieldwork, scholarly activity abroad, advanced degree coursework, disaster training, and didactic curricula.--NEW SECTION--Since 2005, 9 fellows (8 pediatric-trained and 1 emergency medicine-trained) have completed or are enrolled in the PEM-GH fellowship; 3 have graduated. All fellows have completed or are working toward advanced degrees and have or will participate in the disaster management course. Fellows have had 7 presentations at national or international meetings and have published 6 articles in peer-reviewed journals. Of the three graduates, all are working in academic PEM-GH programs and work internationally in Africa and/or Latin America.--NEW SECTION--Our response to a global trend toward improvement in PEM care was the development of the first combined PEM-GH fellowship program. Recognizing the value of this program within our own institution, we now offer it as a model for building such programs in the future. This fellowship program promises to be a paradigm that can be used nationally and internationally, and it establishes a foundation for a full-fledged accredited and certified subspecialty.",eng,Pediatric emergency care,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Competing risks regression was used to assess prostate cancer-specific mortality (CSM), adjusting for age, Japan Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (J-CAPRA) score, diagnosis year, and treatment type [combined androgen blockade (CAB) vs castration monotherapy], comorbidity, and practice type.--NEW SECTION--Men on PADT in J-CaP (13 880 men) were older than those in CaPSURE (1633 men), and had higher-risk disease (mean J-CAPRA score 3.8 vs 2.1, P < 0.001). They more often received CAB: 66.9% vs 46.4% (P < 0.001). Despite different risk profiles between the cohorts, CSM was similar on univariate analysis (log-rank P = 0.88). On multivariable regression, the subhazard ratio for CSM was 0.52 for J-CaP vs CaPSURE (95% confidence interval 0.40-0.68).--NEW SECTION--Men on PADT in Japan have less than half the adjusted CSM than those in the USA. These findings support both existing guidelines endorsing PADT in Asia and discouraging its use in the West. Elucidating the reasons behind these substantial differences, which probably include both genetic and dietary/environmental factors, may help explain the varying epidemiology of prostate cancer on either side of the Pacific.",eng,BJU international,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

A secondary objective was to investigate the relationship between HRQOL, serum ferritin levels and transfusion dependency.--NEW SECTION--This was a prospective multicentre study enrolling 159 patients, of whom 152 received at least one dose of deferasirox. HRQOL was assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline and then at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Primary analysis was performed estimating mean HRQOL scores over time by a linear mixed model on selected scales.--NEW SECTION--The median age of treated patients was 72 years (range 24-87 years). No statistically significant changes over time were found in mean scores for global health status/quality of life (p=0.564), physical functioning (p=0.409) and fatigue (p=0.471) scales. Also, no significant changes were found for constipation (p=0.292), diarrhoea (p=0.815) and nausea and vomiting (p=0.643). Serum ferritin levels were not associated with HRQOL outcomes. A higher patient-reported baseline pain severity was an independent predictive factor of an earlier achievement of transfusion independence with a HR of 1.032 (99% CI 1.004 to 1.060; p=0.003).--NEW SECTION--HRQOL of transfusion-dependent patients with MDS receiving deferasirox therapy remains stable over time.

However, student participation remains limited despite growing educational emphasis upon global health. Medical students continue to report negative attitudes to psychiatry in high-income countries, and in Somaliland, the lack of public sector psychiatrists limits medical students' awareness of mental healthcare. The authors describe the design, implementation, and mixed-methods analysis of a peer-to-peer psychiatry e-learning partnership between UK and Somaliland students arising from a global mental health link between the two countries.--NEW SECTION--Medical students at King's College London and Hargeisa and Amoud universities, Somaliland, were grouped into 24 pairs. Participants aimed to complete ten fortnightly meetings to discuss psychiatry topics via the website MedicineAfrica. Students completed initial and final evaluations including Attitudes toward Psychiatry (ATP-30) questions, a stigma questionnaire, and brief evaluations after each meeting.--NEW SECTION--Quantitative findings demonstrated that enjoyment, interest, and academic helpfulness were rated highly by students in Somaliland and moderately by students in the UK. Somaliland students' attitudes to psychiatry were significantly more positive post-participation, whereas UK students' attitudes remained stable. Qualitative findings identified more gains in factual knowledge for Somaliland students, whereas UK students reported more cross-cultural learning. Reasons for non-completion and student-suggested improvements emphasized the need to ensure commitment to the program by participants.--NEW SECTION--This partnership encouraged students to consider global mental health outside the standard medical education environment, through an e-learning format solely utilizing existing resources. This new approach demonstrates potential benefits to students in contrasting locations of brief, focused online peer-to-peer education partnerships, expanding the scope of health links to the medical professionals of the future.",eng,Academic psychiatry : the journal of the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training and the Association for Academic Psychiatry,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Insufficient vaccine supplies can necessitate rationing, lead to preventable adverse health outcomes, delay the achievements of elimination or eradication goals, and/or pose reputation risks for public health authorities and/or manufacturers. This article explores the dynamics of global vaccine supply and demand to consider the opportunities to develop and maintain optimal global vaccine stockpiles for universal vaccines, characterized by large global demand (for which we use measles vaccines as an example), and nonuniversal (including new and niche) vaccines (for which we use oral cholera vaccine as an example). We contrast our approach with other vaccine stockpile optimization frameworks previously developed for the United States pediatric vaccine stockpile to address disruptions in supply and global emergency response vaccine stockpiles to provide on-demand vaccines for use in outbreaks. For measles vaccine, we explore the complexity that arises due to different formulations and presentations of vaccines, consideration of rubella, and the context of regional elimination goals. We conclude that global health policy leaders and stakeholders should procure and maintain appropriate global vaccine rotating stocks for measles and rubella vaccine now to support current regional elimination goals, and should probably also do so for other vaccines to help prevent and control endemic or epidemic diseases. This work suggests the need to better model global vaccine supplies to improve efficiency in the vaccine supply chain, ensure adequate supplies to support elimination and eradication initiatives, and support progress toward the goals of the Global Vaccine Action Plan.",eng,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

Nutrition is known to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases, and the use of bioactive food compounds at pharmacologic doses is emerging as a preventive and/or therapeutic approach to target metabolic dysregulations occurring in aging, obesity-related chronic diseases, and cancer. Only recently have data on the effects of specific nutrients or food on the immune system become available, and studies regarding the human immune system are still in their infancy. Beyond providing essential nutrients, diet can actively influence the immune system. Understanding how diet and nutritional status influence the innate and adaptive arms of our immune system represents an area of scientific need, opportunity, and challenge. The insights gleaned should help to address several pressing global health problems. Recently, biologically active polyphenols, which are widespread constituents of fruit and vegetables, have gained importance as complex regulators of various cellular processes, critically involved in the maintenance of body homeostasis. This review outlines the potential effects of polyphenols on the function of dendritic cells (DCs), key players in the orchestration of the immune response.

A successful completion of the Chinese reform will offer a new model for social justice development, shift the global economy toward sustainability and create a new hub for science and technology in medical and health science. However, reforming the healthcare system in the most populated country is a daunting task. China will not live up to its promise, and all the potentials may end with hype not hope if coherent national strategies are not constructed and state-of-the-art navigation is not achieved with staggering domestic and global challenges. The cost of failure will be immensely high, socioeconomic costs for Chinese and an opportunity cost for the world as a whole. A full appreciation of the global implications of China's healthcare reform is crucial in keeping China receptive toward good practices evidence-approved elsewhere and open minded to fulfill its international obligations. More critically, the appreciation yields constructive engagements from global community toward a joint development and global prosperity.

Although many hospitals are attempting to promote a patient safety agenda, there are relatively few options to track progress. The aims of this study were to translate and culturally adapt the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) into Gujarati and to provide evidence for its reliability and validity in hospitals in Gujarat, India. We also present preliminary data on the safety culture in these organizations.--NEW SECTION--The first phase was the cultural adaptation and translation of the SAQ into Gujarati. The second phase was a cross-sectional survey of safety attitudes in 4 private hospitals.--NEW SECTION--The survey was distributed to 424 health care workers and elicited an overall response rate of 79%. The questionnaire showed acceptable reliability and preliminary evidence for construct validity among health care workers in 4 private hospitals of varying size. The initial culture score results showed outcomes similar to international standards, with two-thirds of the respondents describing teamwork climate positively and more than half of the respondents describing safety climate positively.--NEW SECTION--This study reveals promising initial results for patient safety culture in India, but further study is needed. The development and validation of the SAQ-Gujarati allow additional hospitals to evaluate their patient safety culture.

The study aimed to examine the associations of burden, coping, self-efficacy with quality of life among family caregivers of persons with dementia in Singapore. Structured interviews were conducted in a convenience sample of 84 family caregivers caring and seeking clinical care for the persons with dementia in an outpatient clinic of a public hospital in Singapore. The outcome measures included the Family Burden Interview Schedule, Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scale, General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale, and World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale - Brief Version. In general, significant correlations were observed between the quality of life scores with coping strategy and family burden scores, but not between the coping strategy and family burden scores. Compared to demographic factors such as caregiver age and household income, psychosocial factors including family burden, coping strategies, and self-efficacy demonstrated greater association with quality of life in the participants. However, the dynamics of these associations will change with an increasing population of persons with dementia, decreasing nuclear family size, and predicted changes in family living arrangements for the persons with dementia in future. As such, it necessitates continuous study examining the needs and concerns of family caregivers and the relevance of ongoing interventions specific to caregivers of persons with dementia.",eng,"Dementia (London, England)",Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016

In this paper, we applied a knowledge-systems perspective to examine how institutional innovations can affect the generation, sharing, and application of scientific and technical knowledge. We report on a case study that examined the effects that one large innovative organization, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, is having on the knowledge dimensions of decision-making in global health. The case study shows that the organization created demand for new knowledge from a range of actors, but it did not incorporate strategies for meeting this demand into their own rules, incentives, or procedures. This made it difficult for some applicants to meet the organization's dual aims of scientific soundness and national ownership of projects. It also highlighted that scientific knowledge needed to be integrated with managerial and situational knowledge for success. More generally, the study illustrates that institutional change targeting implementation can also significantly affect the dynamics of knowledge creation (learning), access, distribution, and use. Recognizing how action-oriented institutions can affect these dynamics across their knowledge system can help institutional designers build more efficient and effective institutions for sustainable development.",eng,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Journal Article,2025-04-23,2016
